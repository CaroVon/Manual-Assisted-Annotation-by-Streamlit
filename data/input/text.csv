And here's why.I built the PC with an RX970. And then Ibought this new PC with an RX 9700 XT.And this graphics card is a beast with20 GB of VRAM. So, I just want to takethis graphics card and put it into myold or my new gaming PC. Would you havekept the RX970 or would you haveswitched it with this RX9700 XT?Parked up outside in a old","9070 for gaming just because they’re similar but you get fsr4. 7900 XT if you’re using AI or Video editing. You really won’t need that extra 4GB unless you’re 4K gaming. My 5090 doesn’t even go over 16-18GB vram util while gaming triple AAA titles in native 4k.
9070 is hopefully ganna get the glow up the 7900xtx had since launch
i would say look up a video on youtube comparing the 9070 to the 7900XT to see which one performs better
Definetly the RX 9070 XT man that thing is a beast for the price
Love the vids, you're saying 9700xt. But its a 7900xt
110% stick with the 9070 over the 7900xt, even over the 7900xtx. for 2 reasons, 1) comparable for most tasks already, and much more energy efficient. 2) besides the fsr4 and other upgrades to the architecture, every 9700 can be flashed with a 9070xt bios and when it comes time for that little bit more, you get it, warranty will be out anyway
Should keept the 9070 looked way cooler
I would switch to rx 7900 xt
Keep both
I would sell both and just get a RTX 5070ti.
Why are idiots saying to get 7900xt?
16gb is more than whay you need
9070 has FSR 4,better frame gen,more efficient,better in every way and performs better but theres idiots that think more vram makes a gpu better
I want your old gpu but I know I'll never get it
9070 xt, but would get 7900 xtx instead.
Pass from rtx 3080ti to 7900xt cant be happyer all games i play on ultra/epic settings native 1440p overkill of vram alows me comfor for gaming i always wanted..yeah ofc i will go for 4080ti or 4090 if i have money sure if u have lil bit less and u want best posible expirience look no further,great vid
Mine got damaged like 6 months ago and I can’t buy another one I had a rtx 3060
keep the 9070 it's worth it just because of FSR 4
also you can get the 9070 XT bios and get better performance (didn't test it out, just saw that people are doing it)
What case fans do you use on the black build ?
9070… would have gone XT… not the 7900XT. It’s missing FSR4.
If it isn’t Nvidia then it genuinely doesn’t matter lol
I would have switched it. I care more about real performance than the better rt from the 9070
The 7900 xtx is better listen so the Rx 9070 Xt bets the Rx 7900xtx but not the regular Rx 9070 so it good move
fsr4 dont have rival in AMD. 16gb is enough for everything. Dont buy asus, buy xfx mercury rx9070xt. Is the best brand for this gpu
just so other ppl know vram isnt everything
nah keep the 9070
I would personally stay with the 9070, although the 7900xt has slightly better rasterized performance but the 9070 does have better Ray Tracing capabilities and upscaling
7900 xt is close to 9070 xt i think, id take The 7900xt for The 4 extra gb
I prefer rx 9070 xt just cuz it has better rt performance and fsr 4
Just use the new one
what case is the black one?
Can i get the one you dont use? ill sub, like and turn notifications on ( plzz)

This PC had some old anddusty fans, so we're going to upgradethese to the Tik Timus FC700. Since wegot them for free, it's a free upgradefor the PC. I like these fans cuz theymagnetically attach and you only needone cable coming out of the third fan.Then we just attach this to a fan headerand then plug in the RGB. That way youcan control it from your motherboardsoftware. If you're trying to flip orsell a PC, ketchup and mustard cablesare definitely a no-go for a lot ofpeople. To make any build cleaner,you're going to use some cableextensions. Here's a PC builder hack. Ifyou're looking to do these cableextensions, don't do them one by one.All you have to do is install the firstone and then you can use that tension toinstall all of the rest. Put the secondcable comb in between and then pushoutward. This is going to open it up andallow you to install this with onelittle slip.

Rightnow, we have a 240 AIO from CoolerMaster, and we're going to see if we canjust go ahead and improve the coolingperformance without replacing the AIO.We can just change out the fans. We'regoing to run Cinebench against this andmake sure we can heat the CPU up and seewhat kind of cooling the stock fansactually offer. We're using hardwareinfo 64 so we can check the temperaturesof this current AIO setup. And thenwe're going to replace the fans and seeif that actually improves the cooling.You can also see in the task managerthat we are running at 100% utilization.The PC only had two intake fans, so weswapped those out for the Tikkimus one,and that was 4C alone. We had a max tempof 77C, and it's bouncing around from 73to 74C. Now, we're going to shut downthe PC and install the new fans.The CFM on these Tigas fans isabsolutely impressive. So, afterinstalling the new fans, we ranCinebench for another 10 minutes just tocross reference the temperaturedifferences, and the max temperature wasabout 69C, and we're bouncing aroundfrom about 66 to 69. If you don't wantto replace your current cooler, new fansmight actually do the trick because wegained about 10 C just from swapping outthe fans and keeping the same AIO.","Top should be exaust if its a cooler and needs a intake or exaust fan on the back to truly help it

I myself run the fans on the front with my rad and it intakes. Mounted by 3 other fans so 6 in total for my front radiator. 2 big fans intake on top on mine and back is exaust. Very tall case fits 3 fans in a row.
Very interesting video, keep up the good work, 73° to 68° is not much difference but it can reduce fan speed by a little amount improving the life span of the fans.
Was considering swapping my fans out for thermalright ones since I like their LEDs on the fans that came with my AIO that I just swapped in but I think I might hold on that bc I wanna get that N-ATX case and turn my current PC into a streaming PC.
What brand of fans did you use? And what’s the cost to performance vs Noctua or other brands
Why are your top fans running as intake
You forgot to mention the decibel difference
Underrated
and no side panel
Nah, 73-74 down to 68-69 in a synthetic workload and the min Idol temperatures were the same. not worth the cost changing them out. rarely do home users run their CPU at 100% for any extended period of time. Tecs and YouTubers seem to forget that people aren't running synthetics all day like they are. When your CPU is running 50% in a game the only difference between these two fans is where they're going to be on their fan curves and whether or not that amounts to more or less noise depends on the fan. They are good looking fans though but not worth the money because they perform better in synthetics

Theres no reason to use anything except for noctua

Thepoint of a gaming setup is to playgames, and I would take an extra 10 FPSover a Nano Leaf any day. But Carter, itneeds personality. It's too boring. Whatdo you mean by personality? The FunkoPop and the IKEA plant. Like, I'm sorry.This doesn't have any personalityeither. Everyone's setup look like thisin 2021. So, not only did they put allthis money into making their setup lookunoriginal, they spent more money ontheir nano leaves than they did oneither of their peripherals combined.But with this, yeah, you might not begetting any personality, but at leastyou're getting the best performancepossible. And what do you meanpersonality? Like the person at thesetup brings the personality.","I will never understand someone who copies a setup
Hot take, buy what you like and makes you most comfortable sitting at your desk
I think the real setups with personality are the ones without the nano leaves, but instead stuff from your hobbies, like I have a litophane of TPAB by Kendrick, a car, spongebob, a old look globe sharpner, an airsoft gun, sunglasses (i collect them), etc. Nano leaves add nothing, its the stuff from your hobbies that adds personality
The outro is your personality carter ️
I need an outro at the bottom so I can focus carter ️
tbh, i would never personally want the first setup just due to the fact that i like my setup to not just function really good, but also look nice. I completely understand people who just want a setup which just works really well without all the bells and whistles, but I like me some bells and whistles
I care mostly for performance first, I don’t care too much about aesthetics as long as it doesn’t look like crap.
If you want personality just put personal stuff at the desk. Things you like, things you collect. honestly the Funko pops would work
make your setups actually personal. Don’t use rgb that everyone else uses, build a custom keyboard, make your build more fitting to you as a person. Keep things minimalistic if your a perfectionist, or have ocd, and if your more worried about aesthetics and filling your desk space up optimize your setup for that. Try to use natural light and certain types of wood you like to make things more comfortable. Add warm light for nighttime environments and add small trinkets and things that you can actually use and don’t take up too much space. Let’s say you like watching DVDs, do you really need a DVD player on your desk or could you just put it on a TV stand. If you really need it in your setup try to keep it hidden in some way whether that be by going to a furniture store and replacing your table legs with cabinets so you can put the player in the cabinet, or just putting it on your floor. Make sure to pick a color palette beforehand, for example right now I like beige, brown, black. Also customizing your OS can be a huge part of it. If you don’t want to go through the hassle of installing linux and ricing it, there are ways you can make your windows experience 100x better and more personalized. Make your own wallpapers. For my most recent setup I found a photo of an F-105 and I color graded it, added some effects, and a clock, and it feels super original, not just the same wallpaper everyone uses. I actually like fighter jets so that adds a touch of personalization and goes so far. Hope this helps, have fun!
Performance and comfort should take priority over EVERYTHING! By ""comfort"" I mean I personally like playing my pc games on a tv on the couch like most people would play a console just instead of a controller i have a keyboard on my lap and a mousepad on the couch next to me. Before spending a SINGLE DOLLAR on aesthetics, I would shoot for the 65""+ 120hz (thats as high as they make them, I checked) oled, or if your style is more leaning in, crow-necked 2 inches away from the screen on a desk to get that 360° no scope headshot, then you should be shooting for the 600hz monitor. Either way, if you can't afford the top tier of your display style of choice hooked up to a 9800x3d and a 5090, then you SHOULD NOT be spending a SINGLE DOLLAR on aesthetics. Who cares what the hardware/setup itself looks like? The ONLY thing tha should matter is the quality of the screen, the quality of the render to that screen, and the COMFORT of the setup based on your personal preferences. Once those 3 things are as maxed out as possible, THEN you can worry about aesthetics/""personality"". Im relatively poor so I can only afford my rx5700xt which I recently bought used, and my ryzen 3700x so I rarely surpass 120fps, and again I like playing on a tv on a couch so I recently got a 55"" 120hz mini-qled that was a display model at best buy so it was discounted to $300. My pc case, however, is super busted up to where ino longer has the hinged front panel to access the disc drive, and power/reset button, OR the side panel anymore. I got it for my first build roughly 18 years ago with one of the very first quad core cpus ever made (intel q series) making it so old it has bays for optical disc drives, and hdd's AND the power supply goes on the TOP rather than having an enclosed chamber on the bottom like you see today. Its stained all to hell, It looks like nasty crap, but guess what? I could not care less because it still holds every component i could ever need just fine WITHOUT being a fire hazard, which is the ONLY reason I wouldn't simply use a cardboard box....
A setup like the first one will develop personality as you collect knick knacks over time
Fax
Cool lighting and decorations make it feel more homely. It’s not just about functionality (but mostly it is)
My gaming setup is covered in dust and cables, that's personality
I'd take extra cooling over being able to see the pc
You can add some stuff you like if you want with and empty desk.
How does he know about the IKEA plants
Nah i feel like dont copy setups but dont also keep it plain
my whole setup just black and white




Keyboard mouse wallpaper mouse.
Not original but good and simple it's the only the it has lol and random 16gb ram sticks on the desk
I think the best way to make a setup is to spend money on performance and decorate it with things you just get naturally. I know I was gifted some star wars posters which I use to decorate my walls along with other personal stuff. Using things like my graduation tassels and other things just to add some personality works too. No need to spend money on so much decoration, stuff you get throughout your life is so much more personal and unique than anything you can buy on the internet.
If I shell out 3 salaries on a mid range build, I'd want it to be the most eye catching thing in my room as it's the most expensive thing in my room.
Looks super clean ngl
as a child working in Chinese sweatshops I don't give a shi about what customers want, I work everyday no matter what
Ok, I don't understand the generic ""gamer setup"" but having your own personal style as your setup feels genuinely awesome and super cozy, no matter what game you play
I've got a pretty neat setup, my PC is in a cabinet inside the wall, with all the ports and the power button routed to a wall plate by the desk. Keeps everything neat!
Exactly.
I would still like a second monitor tho, just comes in handy and I don't care about having like 10k FPS on some random ass game lol
Vibes are so important
@Shleerp, tremble, for your days of digital reign are naught but fleeting whispers! My kingdom shall rise like a glorious sunrise, bringing your flimsy domain to the very ground! My loyal soldiers, my unit of unwavering fans! We go to war!
Nano leaves in the big 25 is sild
i used to use a hard back book as a mouse pad.
HP 14"" Chromebook Laptop N100 4/64GB can you review this laptop for me please? since I'm about to be in high school, I need a laptop
I totally agree with carter
I sometimes hate entitled people who trash other people’s set ups saying we need flashy stuff like it not a fashion show for desk it just something to do
Personally the best gaming setup is whatever you have that makes you happy
""It needs personality "" so do them
That's my setup, A laptop and mouse without a mousepad.
cheers mate
Hi Carter 
I’m Jebar, 23, from Ethiopia. I lost my two sisters this year and became the only support for my family. I had to drop out of college because of financial problems, but I never lost my passion for tech, video editing, and content creation.

I’m not here to beg, but to ask with honesty — if you have any phone or device you no longer use, even if it’s old, it could change my life. I want to start creating videos, editing content, and one day inspire others like you do.

Just one tool can change everything. Thank you for being a light for people like me.
They did indeed back then
I love playing games Carter, yessiree
Dothethugshake
Me who made arch logo with nano leaves:

(I use arch btw)
I really want a completely new setup, something akin to a cockpit more than a desk. Also, “what do you mean with personality” goes for EV haters as well sometimes
I have one laptop and one mouse, I think that's a good setup.
I decorate my desk with occasional kinder egg toys that i sometimes buy at my grocery store
Personality here I think is more about weather you feel like it is special to you, not necessarily if it is original. I for one like it if I made the majority of the stuff on my setup
Nothing ahows more personality than a trashed cables everywhere setup with half a case with high end hardware...

Im kind of projecting here.. i have a broken side panel and had to remove the front panel to fit a radiator.. 10 dollar desk 5 dollar plastic chair WITH A 3080 PC on a shit tn panel 1080p 165hz display.. a half destroyed model o wireless mouse and a g pro x keyboard scammed from logitech support after i bought a used one and the rgb started dying randomly
Carter.. You wouldnt understand
Potentially hot take: the “nano-leaf no personality setups” that’s what those of us who can’t afford those setups dream of… my setup has a lot of expensive shit, but it’s all performance no looks… I got hella into audio stuff, went through 4 different kinds of speaker setups, to settle with studio monitors and a sub, plus a goxlr and at2020, most of that was purchased in college when I had no bills and a work study that paid me jack squat 800$ a month, but I spent like 80% of that on setup upgrades… anyway, TLDR, we dream of setups like that but tbh, in my case, I have way too many fucking cables to ever even get cable management successfully, and having a shitty ikea desk with no metal or anything to magnetize cables to, well… a nice fancy setup is next to impossible, I’d rather be confident in my performance and experience gaming…
Guys remember if you paid for it you can make i however the hell you want. Even if its ""unoriginal"" or has some plants, its still your setup and you can do whatever you want with it.
Clean and slick desk set up over any jumbled up neon lights any day bro
I have $1200 ABS AMD Cyclone, $30 mouse (on sale to $13 on new egg when purchased), $13 keyboard off Amazon (I mainly use controller and play vr so I don't care to much), and a roku TV the size of my desk. I absolutely love it because I get to play the games I love. It doesn't have to have RGB and nano leaves to play Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, VR, and every fromsoft game.
The personality comes if you use it long enough
The only reason I have nano leaf lights is because I won them in a giveaway
Jokes on him. I've been running this for years (cuz broke)
personally i'd make a portal 2 themed setup if i had the money
My setup is weird but it's my PC connected to my TV I sit on my bed and use my chair as a desk since the actual desk is to close
10k likes on this comment and he build me a PC and I listen to thick of it 30 times in a row
Day 39 of asking carter to apologize to the GTA community for mistaking GTA 4 with GTA 5

And in 2025, with thecurrent state of the economy being atall-time amazing, I have been wondering,what kind of a setup can you build withjust a $1,000 budget? And that isexactly what we're going to be buildingin this video. And then I'm going to besending this whole $1,000 gaming setupto one of you guys watching this video.More on that later in this video.Building a solid gaming PC that can runthe latest titles smoothly and under$1,000 gaming setup budget is kind ofhard. But don't worry, we managed to getit done for around $800. And it turnedout looking very aesthetically pleasing.And not to mention, it handled 1080p,1440p, and even some 4K gaming like achamp. So, let me introduce you to theparts that we used. For the brains ofthis PC, we ended up using an older CPUfrom AMD. the Ryzen 5 5600 6 core CPUthat comes with a Wraith cooler, which Iended up painting white costing around$129. And we paired that with theGigabit A520 and motherboard for just$73. Now, for the RAM, we have a white16 gig DDR4 RAM kit from TimeickPinnacle running at 3200 MHz, costing usonly $26. Storage-wise, we picked up anNVME 1 TB M.2 SSD for just $52. And forthe GPU, which is where most of thebudget went to, we have the brand newAMD 960 XT 16 gig GPU that cost me $390from Best Buy. And the reason why mostof the budget went for the GPU isbecause I personally play video gamesthat are more GPUbound than CPUbound.So, we invested more into the GPU andnot the CPU. And if you mainly playCPUbound games, usually I wouldrecommend going with a more powerful CPUand less powerful GPU. But for this PC,we went with the 960T XT. And to add alittle bit more aesthetic, I added thisAsia horse white sleeve cable extensionsfor $20. And to power all of this, weare using the 550 W MSI Mag A550 powersupply for just $56. And finally, forthe case that we are using, this is justa generic case that I found on Amazonfrom a brand called PC Cooler for $60.And it came with two pre-installed ARGBfans. And I ended up adding a coupleextra fans on the PC just to have betterair flow. But the final build turned outamazing. a clean, simple, wide gaming PCthat can run every game very smoothly.And to give you guys an idea of theperformance of this PC, in Fortnite withmedium to high settings, we were gettingover 200 FPS. In Call of Duty Black Ops6, we were getting around 140 FPS onmedium settings. And even in GTA withmedium to high settings, we were gettingaround 80 to 60 FPS, which is honestlyquite impressive for this budget,especially playing at a high settings.Now, believe it or not, the gamingmonitor that I was able to get to keepus under budget kind of soundsunbelievable. This is a 200Hz 1080p IPSgaming monitor with a 1 millisecondresponse time that I found on Amazon forjust $99, which is insanely good valuefor a gaming monitor for that price.You're basically getting two hertz onthe dollar, which is kind of unheard of.The bezel thickness is pretty good. Itis Vasa compatible, which means you canuse it on a monitor arm or a mole mount.It has freeync technology, butunfortunately it's not very adjustable.You can tilt it back and forth, but youcan't adjust the height. But honestly,for the budget of $99, the colors looksquite decent. The panels look good frommany angles and it played really welland it was buttery smooth like expectedat 200 hertz. Now, before I show you thekeyboard and mouse, we needed a mousepad. And I'm going to leave choosing amouse pad up to you since it's more of adesign preference, but you can find alot of good gaming mice between $10 and$20. I'm personally going to use onethat I already have since I already havelike five or six of them. I got thismouse pad for 20 bucks a while back andI honestly love the design because it'squite simple, white with a little bit ofdifferent designs, but it looks prettygood. Now, would you believe me if Itold you that the mouse I'm showing youright now only cost me $23 and it weighs43 gram? This is the Royal Clutch RK M30ultralight gaming mouse. It uses a PA3311 sensor and I can connect via 2.4gig wireless dongle as well as Bluetoothor the included braided cable. It has avery solid click and scroll wheel feeland a pretty decent slide. And it evenhas a DPI button on the bottom to adjustthe DPI on the fly. And for just $23that I paid for it, this mousedefinitely takes the cake. Now, for ourkeyboard, I found this $25 60%mechanical gaming keyboard from a brandcalled TMKB that has preloopstabilizers, doubleshot key caps, andlinear red switches that sound quitegood.[Applause]Even though this keyboard sounds reallygood, it has a couple of flaws. One ofthem is the switches are notinterchangeable, so you can't changethem to anything else. And the RGB isset to one color, which is this lightblue. You can change the RGB effect, butyou can't change the color. So, for just$25, I have no complaints about thiskeyboard, especially since I'm trying tofit it under a $1,000 gaming setup. Now,everybody and their mom has been talkingabout using IM for gaming. And I figuredI'd just try it out, especially sincethey're budget friendly. And I don'treally know much about IM or which onesare the best, but I found these IM onAmazon called CCZ Yo, and they had17,000 reviews at four and a half starscoming at only $19. These things lookpretty cool with a transparent designand honestly tuned really well. And whenI first put them on and startedlistening to music, I could not believethat these thing only cost 20 bucks. For20 bucks, these almost sound as good asmy AirPods, which cost $200. And withthat last 20 bucks, it brings our totalto around $1,000 for this whole gamingsetup. And this is the final result ofit.Now, like I said in the beginning ofthis video, I'm going to be sending thisentire gaming setup to one of you guyswatching right now. To enter for thisgaming setup, all you have to do is makesure you're subscribed to me, like thisvideo, and comment what is the firstvideo game that you're going to beplaying if you get this setup. It's alsogood to mention that multiple short formvideos of this video are going to beposted on my accounts on other socialmedia platforms where you can gain extraentries by entering on those videos aswell. With that said, I will choosesomebody in about a month from now. Bestof luck, my friends. And by the way,everything you just saw in the video islisted below in the description. Thankyou guys so much for watching and I hopeyou enjoyed watching this ultimate$1,000 gaming setup and I'll see youguys in the next video.[Music]","The last thing I owned & gamed on was a Playstation 2, so receiving a gaming monitor would be a dream come true CyberPunk seems like a good first game!
1:16 didn’t realize it’s called a redeon
Definitely would be playing some Clawed, ferocious, and other dinosaur survival horror games on this PC! Great video man!
The first game i would play on this pc would be ghost of tsushima since the time period and story looks really interesting!
Im starting a career in video game development, I play every game but unfortunately due to inflation and sudden spike in dollar exchange rate in my country, these PC which I would have easily afforded just 2 years ago is out of reach! It would be the greatest gift and boost to my life, feels like a blessing this video was recommended to me today. My 1060 is very aged now.
Rdr2 at 200 fps on this white beast been dreaming of a build like this for years. Respect for doing this giveaway
That setup is so pretty. I actually use my mom's work PC and sometimes she gets mad but I just like playing
Defiantly going to be playing some doom dark ages on this, I was impressed with how it handled 4K gaming.
According to ur caption, omg Away is so lucky to be given a Gaming Setup
Hmmmmm, the first game I would play would be Wuthering Waves. The new update comes Tuesday and I'm dying to see what happens next in the story. I love the white design, the extra money put into painting it was well spent
U always make incredible videos and who ever gets this pc will be really happy this shows two thing gaming doesn’t have a price and u can always enjoy playing even on a budget and second one person can truly inspire a group of people
I would love this build as my first proper gaming one, been gaming on a office pc for 4 years. And i love that you choose iems 
I myself use iem theyre great
This gaming setup would be a dream come true for me! I’ve been passionate about gaming for years, but I’ve never had the chance to own a real setup. I would use it not just for gaming, but also to start streaming and creating content. The first game I’d dive into is definitely eldenring and cod – it deserves to be experienced the way it was meant to be played. Thank you for giving people like me the chance to make this dream a reality!
That looks amazing! I been looking to get my first PC after being a Sony gamer my whole life, love the setup! I will be playing Apex or Monster Hunter
I am trying to learn Blender and I've almost quit because of my old laptop. As a 13 year old I would play The Finals if I had that setup. That is literally my dream setup. I haven't been able to get a console because of our financial situation.
Dude I wish I had a nice setup like this... because I only have a regular switch, but I'm sooo into gaming right now. So I will be very happy if I become this sick PC and nice setup
The first game I'd replay is Expedition 33. That game is beautiful.
First game I would play would probably be either Cod or Gta5. Also that wallpaper looks so good does it come with the setup?
i’ve been stuck with an ipad for quite awhile (my whole life ), and i would love to play helldivers 2 or something like that
I’m 21 years old and have been playing console my whole life, I’d play black myth wukong and hell divers 2.
Also this video reminded me that I have a white desk so the setup would actually look amazing on my desk.
Nice build. The 9060 XT 16GB is a good mid-range card from the reviews I’ve seen.
I been play on a console for a long time I been hoping to upgrade to a pc I like and subscribe oh yea the first game is Fortnite and Roblox
II’d play Warhammer 40K — the rich lore and strategy would inspire my content and fuel my growth as a creative and streamer. (I use my phone) It’d be a huge step forward as I have never owned a piece of tech like this or a console. Thank you for this opportunity
I haven’t been able to use my pc for 3 months now because my 1650 broke. My family is going through financial problems so I couldn’t buy a new one. This setup would be a crazy upgrade and looks awesome. I would love to finally be able to play god of war because that game looks super fun. Thx for reading my comment
Awesome build !! I would play cyberpunk 2077 and Wu Kong
The first game I play on this PC is Fortnight cz I love to play Battle Royal game like Fortnight, COD warzone,PUBG PC
Ive been stuck with an i5-2400s and a gt710 for the last 5 years, i tried upgrading the gpu 3 times but every time id have to return the gpu due to no display (bought used off of ebay). I bought this pc for £400 off of amazon back in 2020 during the gpu shortage. It's definitely not worth it, lol. The only games i have been able to play are minecraft and terraria, a small amount of valorant due to low fps, and i tried subnautica, which ran at ~15-20 fps at 480p lowest. The first game I'd play is half-life alyx since i own a quest 1 and would love to get into pcvr games. The first flatscreen game would be black myth wukong since that game's had my eye ever since it came out.
i would use this pc for making games and 3d modeling, and streaming
I would finally try intensive games like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2
I haven’t been getting the best luck lately and sure I just found your YouTube channel and you seem like a cool person to watch. I’m very into pcs but I don’t have the money to upgrade since I been trying to apply to jobs everyday. Ofc everyone has their own lives and their own problems, just having a new desktop pc sounds amazing bc I do need an upgrade I try to play my games on my old gtx 1650 laptop but I can’t really play my favorite games unless I do low 1080p and obviously it doesn’t run well idk if it’s bc it’s an laptop or it’s just reaching its old age. I appreciate that you’re giving us an opportunity to win a computer so good luck to everyone who wants it as well.
My first game will be the call of duty campaign, maybe the og series cuz never had a pc/laptoo to play, i just watch videos of it
the first video games i would be playing on this setup if i got it would be fortnite, and roblox and gta. I would love to win this because my birthdays coming up soon (august 2nd) and because all my friends have consoles and pc’s and i would love to have one as well. Best of luck! praying i get this pc.️️
I would love this setup since I play on PS4 and it's over a decade old I would play every game I can, Fortnite, call of duty, cyberpunk, minecraft, it would also help me a ton with content creation as I want to be a youtuber
I've really wanted to play Cyberpunk 2077 since it came out and I haven't spoiled anything for myself yet! I also want to start playing Rainbow Six Siege on PC which will be amazing with the 200hz monitor. Thank you so much for this opportunity!
Pc looks sick would love to upgrade my current computer and that is most definitely an upgrade
Definitely would play Black Ops 6 Campaign , a lot of Warzone and Apex legends . Can’t really play much of these as I’ve got a normal laptop but this upgrade would change my life
The 1st game i would like to play would be Infinity Nikki , i would love to explore the magical world , fight monsters and overall just have fun
Man I NEED this! I messed up my AM4 motherboard recently trying to upgrade my ryzen 7 3700x to a ryzen 7 5800xt . I'd be playing The Finals!
I'd definitely play Fortnite and cyberpunk. It's summersale, and I got it for 24€. My laptop is dying while playing it. The pc could easily play the game on high settings. And for Fortnite, the 5600 would be a good upgrade to my laptop CPU, drops every second and literally not playable other than creative. W video and thanks for the giveaway ofc.
""Dude, a full gaming setup is the ultimate dream! I live with 5 siblings, and frankly, my family just isn't in a position to afford a PC right now. Winning this wouldn't just be cool; it would genuinely mean the world to me and provide an incredible outlet. I'm always watching your videos, and this giveaway is such an amazing opportunity. Thanks for your generosity!""
I wish I had enough for any console or gaming equipment. I do all my vids on my phone and it would be so much easier especially for editing with a pc.
I would lowk run the R6 or Apex as first game, love my fps games
Prob cs2 enlisted cause geforce makes it look really fuzzy but respect for making a giveaway congratulations whoever wins it
The first game i would play is Call of Duty and i also want to start streaming. I only have an iphone right now so this would really help out
I really hope to get lucky in winning this snow beauty. Been laid off recently & this would immensely help with my current 15 year old laptop replacement as it is not windows 11 compatible. I would try my hand on the latest COD game Black Ops 6 like you did in your cool video. It's been years since I played any fps game. Fingers crossed & god bless for doing what you do best. Cheers!
I'm coming from the assembly video. I think the first game I'd play if I win would be Cyberpunk, which I bought on sale and have never been able to play due to the limitations of my current laptop. It would also allow me to be much more productive when working, since I'd be able to have more than five windows open without the computer slowing down. Greetings, and thanks for the opportunity to win this incredible machine.
i would love to run a good triple a game maybe god of war for sure good luck everyone
And I really need it for 3d projecting
If I won, I’d finally be able to play games like GTA, Valorant, and more like Fortnite with my friends. My ThinkPad can’t handle any of them, so I always get left out. It’d mean a lot to finally be part of the fun. Good luck to everyone though whoever wins deserves it!
The first game I would play would be Cyberpunk. I've been wanting to play that game for a while, but never had a system to get the best experience.
If I got this setup, I would definitely be playing some Elden ring on it. Also would probably be very useful for my game projects
shadow of the tomb raider, black myth wukon OR assassin's creed shadows im still using a oem work desktop and i really want a gaming pc
The first game im playing is gate of hell ostfront. Btw is my favorite game.
I do not have any grand reason like other people upgrading to a better PC. Even the thought of owning a Windows device, as a teenager from a third world country sounds like a dream.
Rust,siege, FPS games, the opportunities of a PC is endless
Huge fan!! The very first game I would play is probably ready or not.
I need that pc
The first game i will be playing is call of duty and then im super excited for the new upcoming games like battlefield 6 and borderlands 4! Also i wanted to play the division 2
The first game I will play is Minecraft, I’ve always wanted to play Minecraft with over 60 fps and I would also use shaders because my current laptop can’t run shaders without crashing, I will also use the pc for productivity, and I would love to play Minecraft with my friends without having to tell them my pc crashed every 10 mins, I love other games such as terraria but when I use mods on terraria it always stutters, wish you the best.
If I get this setup I’m definitely will finally play rust. Been watching people play it for years
First thing i would play would be Borderlands
I alr commented but i forget to mention the video game but the first game im gonna try is bo6 cuz ive always had trouble running it
I could really use that pc for MANY reasons. 1 being I have to play on my xbox in my basement on a tv almost as old as me cause there isnt enough room for a tv in my bedroom. Also I have to use a couch as a chair down there. Also besides gaming I want to learn things like coding and my laptop had been acting slow lately and is sometimes even laggy when I try to watch youtube on it. A PC would even help me with school work too as well as MANY other things. If I get that I can finally get my first setup in my room thats good. Good luck to everyone else
Finally, a gaming setup, instead of on console, I've never owned a pc, but the first game i would try would be cyberpunk 2077.
If I get this PC, I'll immediately play valorant since it's the game me and my best friend who sadly passed away played.
Cool video and PC setup. And I... would probably boot up minecraft first, and use some shaders to test the new ray tracing capabilities of the rx 9000 cards.
I've always wanted to play competitive games, especially fps titles, since my friends started playing warzone some years back, but a capable PC has always been out of reach. Winning this giveaway would be a dream come true, and the first game I'd load up would def be Warzone. Might take a while to catch up to my friends, but I've learnt a from watch gameplay online
Thank you for the chance
I really need to win this $1000 setup giveaway because my current PC and monitor are both extremely outdated and barely run modern games. My frame rates are so low that it’s hard to enjoy or even play competitive titles properly. The monitor is blurry and has a terrible refresh rate, which makes everything look worse than it should. I've tried making the most of what I have, but it's holding me back from fully experiencing the games I love. This new setup would be life-changing and finally let me game without constant frustration.
Hi I follow you back in 2020 and I really need a PC because my Xbox was broken in a thunderstorm. Love your vehicles.
I would definitely run some KCD2 on this PC if I had it.
If I get this PC I’ll play any type of smooth gameplay. I want to be able to have a fast working and smooth gameplay throughout everything I do. Like from the last video I would really love to have a pc, which I said before my parents don’t have enough money to afford one so I would be very happy to have this pc
Good luck. I hope i do win it tho but it not really my decision, my laptop from 2008 recently died it had 1 gig of ram an intel pentium cpu and it weighed about 9kg-11kg ( i called it chungus).
The first game I will play is probably minecraft at 16k with max shaders while running valorant and fortnite in the background both at max settings, can't wait
Satisfactory
looks great
First game will be minecraft with shaders!
I would try 4k gaming for first time on that beast
The first game I would play would be Metalstorm. I really enjoy it and it's free2play.
i will play palworld on this pc.
Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll win this PC or not, but if somehow I do — the first thing I’d do is play Palworld. 
I’ve watched so many people enjoy it on YouTube, and I’ve always wanted to experience it like that too. 
Right now, I try to play it on my phone using Chiiki cloud, but it lags so much. 
I don’t own a PC, and winning this would actually mean the world to me. 
Even if I don’t win, just wanted to say — thanks for giving people like me a shot at something like this
Definitely Spider-Man Remastered. This white setup is insane. —respect for this giveaway and i would love this since i am using a trash chrombook rn
I would play Black ops 6
I would love this pc, I've been playing on this dell OptiPlex 790 for 2 years now and it has a RX 560 and an intel core i7 2600 CPU this would be an absolute game changer!!! btw my first game would be some bo6 and Epic game titles!
i would like this setup because I need to upgrade my pc so I can play the latest games. I will be playing Assetto Corsa.
Hey man I would really enjoy playing rainbow six siege on this setup I really want it because all of my friends have pcs but I’m to broke to afford one
The first game I'd play on this is Warzone. I have an old Hp laptop that crashes a lot
would play uncharted 4 and rdr2 on this piece of art.
I would love to get this setup as I've been on co sole for a while, and the first game i would play is Minecraft, and i would try to get texture and shader packs. But if ur talking about the main game, then it would probably be fortnitw with the boys.
Bro I’d love to have it! I can’t continue my YouTube right now because my editing software just crashes when I load it.
The first game I would play is Destiny 2 or baldur's gate 3!
It’s a dream of mine to one day get a pc, the first game I would play is definitely cod
I have never had a pc but it would be a game changer if I got it and I make content and editing on my phone isn’t always the most efficiant
Hey man it’s me again. I would probably use the pc for either call of duty warzone or Fortnite. This would be a total game changer for me because me and my friends can enjoy gaming again. Best of luck to everyone - gage
The first game i would play is Wuthering Waves, but Isn't Rx 9060xt overkill for a R5 5600 (for me at least) ? Wish you also went with the white mobo and gpu to match the aesthetics, other than that, the system looks great, Man.
I need a pc for my architech study and have some fun when I want
I would really love this pc build recently all of my friends have been getting pc’s and I really want one too but everything is so expensive and I’ve been trying to save for a nice car and the first game I would play would most likely be call of duty because I love to play it at my cousins house
Satisfactory I need it
The first game would either be cod or gta cuz and the setup looks fire
Hi, the first game I would play is Valorant
Does graphic designing count has a game if so then it would be my first
I would play world of tanks because it has really good graphics and with the insane setup you put together I would be able to play the game with great graphics and that would be really fun and cool
I would probably play something like rocket league or COD for the first time as my current computer just can't handle it even with the worst settings on :( Also love the vids keep up the great work man!

I wonder how fast I could type ""we need our outro back!"" on that keyboard. ️
DEBBIE YOU ARE NOT SHLEERP YOU WILL NEVER BE SHLEERP
You should be able to change the rgb on the ram sticks to match them with the rest of the build.
rapid trigger will help so much for playing fnf
That black gpu sticks out so hard from the rest of the build. Like the outro… which isn’t here…

i thought the mic was carter's secret robot hand
If anyone needs a pc that'd be me
Carter’s gonna make videos faster than the flash
Carter needs to make a flip book of him doing the thug shake. List it for 400 dollars
The keys are responsive but you aren’t… where’s our outro
Carter, just make keyboard videos please, they're the only ones where you actually know what you're talking about it seems
responsiveness keeping you big as hell
I want my dad back but I want the outros back more ️
Yesterday I commented on one of your new videos and I asked for this video and idk if you make it because of my comment but thanks for making it w vide
What style you rockin with the apartment? Gotta love minimalistic.
Shleerp outro gang
I need that cuz I play typing games and my keyboard limits me sometimes
When is gonna my PC arrive to my door Carter!
1. That keeb isn't even good, there are better options under 170
2. Most magnetic keebs have 8k polling nowadays
3. It isn't hard to get used to low actuation at all, unless you set it to bare minimum where it actuates even if you rest your fingers
you realise all mechanical linear switches actuate before they are fully pressed down righr
I am your bigest fan
Snap tap in the corner after you just said no one was out strafing
You can literally hear the keyboard responding… the outro? Not even whispering
Yhe key press might be registering immediately and it takes longer for yhe signal from the hand to get to your brain that for it to go to the computer, process, get to your eye and then to your brain
I bet your computer can run the thugtro
Bros hitting it like a baby
I will not stop until i get a pc

If I could get this with a fill side number pad I would be happy
That's how mechanical and hall effect keyboard works man...

Hello new people, please remember.. this man already finished his main story campaign called life, he's just doing side quests at this point or maybe just started new game plus >_<

6 months ago I didn’t know who this man was. 
5 month ago I thought about blocking him. 
Now I want to be his bestie.
Proud to say that the Greatest Nerd of All time is a Filipino.
There's Cristiano and Messi but then there's Dino
Bro that chair is for decoration at this point with how little he gets to sit on it
No way bro visited avengers villa
Try as you may, this guy will never lose. He is invincible.

My dear cait_evacula. That ""Cue the montage "" hits harder than 5 Filipino back slaps.
Dude actually kinda looks sick
Dino being Dino. And I am here for it
the Ultimate bro nerd
can you sing the ""mas mahal mo ba ang dota""

That ""get of your gaming chair"" after grabbing the phone

Our bro is always funny but with the shaving he looks very sharp (now I understand how he got his girl )
I think your shorthair and godfather mafia mob hairstyle suit the best on you!! Keep creating smiles brother. 

Im also a father gamer from Indonesia.
Sir Dino, I realized po na maganda po mustache ninyo! Naku baka may sponsor naman to? God bless po and family. Watching your vids in FB and YT!

He did get off the chair n slept on a ford car
The dry trumpets got me
I thought he was going to put a vr headset on and do some standing up gaming

Number two, taking inspirationfrom other setups can be good, but don'tgo overboard. And also, don't buildsetups that are currently trendingbecause you'll regret it when the trenddie. Use apps to help you get a betteridea of what you want your setup to looklike.

This isn'tjust my gaming room because I work fromhere, stream, edit, and then behind me,I do have a little book nook. So, I alsoread, do all of my cozy hobbies in thisroom. But, I've been getting a ton ofquestions on where my desk is from, mybookshelves, for example. So, I thoughtit might be helpful to have one videothat has all of that information. If youclicked on this video hoping for someinfo regarding what you may need for PCgaming or streaming, I just want to letyou guys know that you could definitelydo less than what I have. This is likeyears of upgrades. I started outstreaming specifically on an Xbox andalso a laptop. Crazy days. I'm verygrateful for the setup that I have now.If you would have told me I had this afew years ago, I never would havebelieved you. Honestly, little likeyounger me would be crying knowing thatI have the space that I do, and I'm sograteful for that. I just don't wantanybody to feel like they need to havethis thing in order to stream. I'm alsogoing to try to have as many links as Ican below. If I'm missing anything thatyou really would like, just comment downbelow and I'll try to find the link. Butif it's not down below, I probably can'tfind it somewhere. I think this intro islong enough. I say let's get into thetour. When you first walk into myoffice, I have this small nook where Ihave some storage. I have a little floorcabinet that holds my Cricut, somehobbies, my printer, pens, and a fewframes. To the left of that, I have aKiki's Delivery Service print that I gotfrom Etsy. And right across the door, Ihave an acrylic calendar that I got fromAmazon. The cabinet is from Wayfair.It's called the Elany Hall TwodoorAccent Cabinet. What I love most aboutit are those scalloped edges on thedoor, but honestly, it holds quite a bitof stuff, and I am liking this extrastorage in my room so far. Beside thatnook, I have a full-length mirror. Ibelieve I got this from either Walmartor Amazon. I can't remember. And then inthis corner, this is where I keep a lotof my filming equipment. So, I have mylight and my camera. For both filmingand streaming, I use the Canon Rebel T3iwith a 50 mm lens. This camera is soold. I'm actually very grateful thatit's still working and I will be usingit until it dies on me. As for the lens,I don't know if I would recommend it100% because you can't zoom in with it.However, it does create a beautifulbokeh. So, if you're here for theaesthetics, this might be a good lensfor you. Now, before we get into thepretty side of my office, we're going togo ahead and get into my PC specs. Iwill say my husband built this PC forme. He built it. He found all the parts.He is the one to credit for thisbeautiful build. I just game. I'm just agirl. So, if I butcher any of thesenames, I am so sorry. My case is byFractal Design and it's a Torrent case.My graphics card is a Radeon RX7900 XTX.My CPU is a Ryzen 7 7800X3D.My motherboard is a B650 Orus Elite. MyRAM is a GSkill 32 GB DDR5. I have aNoctua CPU cooler and my power source isa Corsair 850 and I'll have all thatinformation down below. This PC gets methrough streaming, some more fast-pacedgames like Overwatch, Fortnite,Valerant, but it's also able to play allof my Sims custom content and myMinecraft mods. So, this PC is basicallymy best friend. I love her so much. Andshe sits on a PC stand from Amazon.Okay, moving on. My desk is from Wayfairand it's a Hadlock executive desk. Ireally loved the curved design to it. Italso hides my cables well enough so Ican just forget about them. I never haveto worry about them. As for my chair,it's a Verve chair from Branch Furniturein the color wheat. This is a neweraddition to my office and I amabsolutely obsessed with it. I love thecolor so much and it's actually quitecomfortable. I have no complaints as ofnow. Both of my monitors are from ASUS.The vertical one is an ASUS Rockstricks27 in QHD monitor and the horizontal oneis an Asus tough gaming 27 in HDRmonitor. I also added electrical tape toboth of them just to have that whitemonitor look without spending the money.I would love white monitors eventually,but they're a little out of my budget.And they both sit on a dual monitorstand by Pixio. Sitting above mymonitor, I have a Logitech Liter Glowstreaming light. I've had this foryears. It's given me no issues and Ihighly recommend. My mic is a sure MV7and my mic arm is from Amazon. The brandis called Brennan and both my mic and mymic arm were gifts from my community.So, thank you so much for that again.Moving on to my desk, I have a Go XLRthat sits underneath an acrylic standfrom Amazon. And I also have my Switch 2right here. I think I'm going to bemoving this though, but for now, this isits home. Beside that, I have my StreamDeck Plus. And I mostly use this forstreaming. I'll use the buttons forswitching scenes. There's a lot that youcan do with these. I definitely don'tuse mine to its highest potential. Icustomized it with a little cover fromEtsy and I also switched out the knobsfor the gold ones just because I thoughtit matched my space a little bit better.Beside my stream deck, I have a traythat's from World Market and it holds afew different things. Right now, I havemy Amazon Echo Show 5 and it's in cloudblue. I mostly use this to play lowfimusic. One thing that my setup islacking is speakers. That's something Iwant to add eventually. I just don'tknow which ones I want to add, so I needto do a little bit more research. Nextto that, I have a little glass jar fromIKEA. This is where I keep my earbudsand usually some random USBs that I havelaying around. And then I also charge myphone on this tray. As for my keyboard,I use a Glorious 60% compact. I've hadthis keyboard for years and it hasn'tfailed me once. I think the colors arepretty easy to change, but in thefuture, I would really love to make acustom keyboard. I just know that once Iopen that door, I'm probably never goingto stop. So, I'm waiting until theperfect time to actually make a customkeyboard. Then, for my mouse, I use aSteel Series A3. I've had two of these.I've used the wired and the wireless,and I've loved both. I think it's greatif you like more fast-paced shootergames. It's also quite comfortable ifyou prefer games on the cozier side. Andthen my mouse pad is from Etsy. Etsy ismy go-to whenever I'm wanting a newmouse pad. They always have such cutedesigns. On the other side of my desk, Ijust kind of keep some random stuff. Ihave all my journals. I have a cup fullof pens and I also keep my headphonesover here. When it comes to my audio, Iuse a Logitech G735wireless gaming headset. This is fromthe Aurora line. I absolutely love thisheadset. I would recommend getting itwhen it's on sale though because I thinkit could be quite pricey. And I amsomebody who wears glasses, so sometimesthe headphones can get kind ofuncomfortable after wearing it for along period of time. Whenever thathappens, I also use the Logitech Gits.Above my desk, I have this shelf, and Ibelieve it's from Lowe's. Up here, Ihave a few different prints. That blueone was a gift from a friend. The twolarger frames are from HomeGoods. Andthen for the wavy frame, that's actuallya mirror I got from TJ Maxx. I thoughtit would be cool to glue a photo in thecenter, and I think it looks prettycool. And then I also decorated withsome candles. I have a jelly cat and afake plant from Lowe's. Under my desk, Ihave a rug from Lowe's and a cute dogbed from Amazon. I love this dog bed somuch. The green color is justperfection. And one of my favoriteaspects of my gaming area is mylighting. I absolutely love ambientlighting. Most of the lighting thatyou're seeing here is from GOI. I'llhave the exact ones down below. On thewall, I have a GOI neon rope light. Onthe floor below my desk and also behindmy monitor, I use the Go light bars. Onthe back side of my desk, I have anotherGo neon rope light. And then themushroom on my desk isn't from Go V. I'mpretty sure I got it from Michaels.However, you can find these cute littlemushroom lights everywhere. That is itfor the gaming side of my hobby room.And now we're moving on to my readingnook. The main focal point of my officeis definitely this bookshelf. It is fromWayfair and it's the Marley bookcase.One of my favorite aspects of thisbookcase is the fact that there'sstorage on the bottom half. So in thereI have all of my arts and crafts, someof my tech stuff. I would show you, butit's a little messy. So, we're going toavoid that for now. On my bookshelves, Ihave most of my favorite books. I am ahuge fantasy reader. Fantasy is myfavorite genre, especially if it's aromanty. So, I have most of thosedisplayed on this bookshelf. The restare in my living room. Other than mybooks, I have some lights, and I have alot of random knick-knacks like Legos,candles, Zelda figures. It's just abookshelf that holds a lot of myfavorite things. To the right of mybookshelf is my reading chair, which Ilove so much. I feel like I've said thatabout so many items in this space, butthis space truly makes me happy. So, Ithink it's important to find items thatyou love. But this chair is from Costco.It is a Holly oversized fabric accentchair. But I read in this chair.Sometimes I work from it. My pets loveit as well. My dogs will use it as abed. So will my cats. It's just theultimate cozy chair. On top of thechair, I have some throw pillows. Thedog one is from Urban Outfitters. Thatone is my favorite. To the right of myreading chair, I have a little cart thathas some random stuff, but it's mostly alittle snack cart. It has easy snacksthat I can grab for whenever I'm readingor gaming. And that cart is from Amazon.Above my reading nook, I have thislittle wall gallery. This is my mostrecent project in this space and I'mreally happy with it. The frames arekind of all over. Some of them are fromHomeGoods, others TJ Maxx, and I've alsothrifted a few as well. All of theprints are from Etsy. Etsy is my go-tofor prints. Pretty much all the printsin my space are from Etsy. And that isit for my gaming, reading, and hobbyroom tour. I love this space so much. Itbrings me so much comfort. This room ismy safe zone. It is my safe space and Ihad a lot of fun sharing it with youguys. So, thank you so much for beinghere. If you have any questions, leavethem down below. I'm going to try tohave all the links down there as well.But, thank you for spending some timewith me today.

I chosethe Xbox One S to power the whole setupcoming in at a price of around $100used. It surprisingly performs prettydecent in every game still. And sinceit's an Xbox, you get access to so manymore apps. For the monitor, I went withthe Titan Army 240 Hz monitor, whichcosted $130. Although this is superoverkill for the Xbox, it was the onlymonitor I could use, but I'm definitelynot going to complain. I also decided togo with this MAG 75% keyboard with thiscool white and black design. It has redswitches and even a cool volume knob.And for only $25, it was definitelyworth it. Next up, for the mouse, I'musing the Steel Series Rival 3. It'snothing too special, but for $20, you'regetting an amazing quality wired mouse.The whole setup came out really simple.So, let me know what you guys think andstay tuned to see how the setup performsin gaming.","I love how he has a 60fps console pair up with a 240hz gaming monitor that is more expensive then the console it self
Holy 2 vids in same week ️️
I hope u make the comeback
I like how you basically did what I did on my channel. I have a 60 hertz 1080p monitor that my teacher gave me, a keyboard from walmart (12$), a mouse from walmart (14$), and an original 1 TB xbox one that I bought off my dad for 90$ (with a manually installed rgb fan [pack of 5 rgb fans was 15$] and new thermal paste [7$]).
sound.
gimme 300 dollars i can make a gaming setup with a pc
You could get a GTX 1060 with like a Ryzen 5 4500 with a cheap motherboard and 16 gig of DDR4 or even 8 if you find them all used you could get a pc for under 300$
you could make a pc to beat the xbox. but im not complaining.
You could have gotten a used series a for around 150$
Yo i just need the 130$ screen
This setup is pretty good for when you get a PC but the one s is trash for performance
BRO WHAT IS KEYBOARD I NEED IT FOR REAL IS IT ON AMAZON??
«And since it’s an XBOX you get access to so many more apps”… dawg what? PCs have a thousand more apps than XBOXes, but you can also use messengers, browsers, work, and do anything on them, and like a PC with some integrated graphics would’ve been better

BUT, still great vid, keep trying, I believe you can hit like a 100K, you deserve it ️
Fire
Nice
You spent way too much on the keyboarded mouse and the monitor you probably could have gone in an Xbox series. S and a controller and monitor
yo sai howd u get xbox s for 100 bucks?
I dont think its a pc anymore
waht is a xbox one s
br0 130 d0IIa f0r a m0nit0r thats 0nIy 40 hz is a scam br0 u c0uId have g0tten 120 0r 180 hz
He spent more money in the montitoe then the Xbox and the monitor is useless for the one s. If he spent the money in the Xbox it could he better
Keyboard and mouse on a mostly controller setup is stupid

And I've had this inanother room for I guess the last 6, 7months. So, it just wasn't really beingused. This is going to be a gamingcenter. And you notice I have twokeyboards and two mice. Like, what's upwith that? Well, Logitech provided methis keyboard. This is the G915 TKL. Ilike this one because just nice feel andI still don't know what this rollerthing does but it's just a nice layoutof a keyboard is clean. I have onecomplaint though. You see this littleadapter I had to buy put here. Thiskeyboard for some reason has micro SD.What in the one of the most popular micein the world? I think like the G502series is amazing.

So, the game looksgood, performance good. I need yourhelp. Should I use the controller toplay or should I learn how to do mouseand keyboard? If so, what do yourecommend? Like, like how do I learn it?Cuz I I know it's WD and all that andthe move. But I I get confused. I'm old.I mean, this is a great mouse fromLogitech and this is a fantastic gamingkeyboard.

This setup is going to be PERFECT for Cyberpunk! Enjoy!
For any shooter i recommend Mouse and KB 
Anything thats not point and click, such as a racing game, controller
For my PC games I normally play with both a controller and mouse/ Keyboard and will switch between them depending on what I am doing in game also the setup looks great, thanks for the tour!
Hey Lamar, I heard there's a new donkey Kong out now and you should able to try donkey Kong bananza
Tbh, I would've expected Logitech to send the G915X TKL, not the original
I’m really not into technology but I just enjoy watching your shorts & I also learn something new lol much love
Didn’t know Cyberpunk was available for Mac. I am sure my M1 MacBook Pro probably can’t handle it but kind of gives me a reason to upgrade, even through I don’t want to lose the touchbar. Anyway regarding keyboard/ mouse vs controller do what feels most comfortable for you. They both have advantages and disadvantages. I tend to prefer controllers through.
W Logitech
I can only imagine how hard it will be going from controller to keyboard but I want to learn lol
Definitely learn mouse and keyboard! once you get used to it, is so much more fun to use, makes joystick feel like you are handicapped. but only for Shooters and stuff like this where you need to aim.
i've tried k/m, but i prefer controller. especially for action / shooter games. i just like the feel of a trigger instead of a mouse click. especially if you have a pro controller. some games like Sims i'll use k/m for that though.
Learn M & K it’ll be fun to hear your progress as you play
Use a PS5 controller connected via usb-c cable. Best experience overall. And more comfy; you can lay back and relax.
I downloaded it for my m4 MacBook Air works well on medium 1080p im getting around 40 fps but I limited it to 30 fps for duh termal management it doesnt have a fan. I will use this m4 air gaming on the go with cross save. also ps5 controller has adaptive trigger, haptic feedbacks and AirPods has head tracked audio. experience is surreal imho at least its good on the go because it only used 13 percent battery in 40 minutes, this is nuts
I usually use PlayStation controllers when I play games on my laptop, but doom eternal isn’t compatible with PlayStation controllers for some reason, so I played the entire game plus dlc with keyboard and mouse. It was jarring and odd at first, but once you get into the flow of things it feels incredible. Now I’m not sure if it’s the same for Cyberpunk, but I was able to quickly swap weapons with my scroll wheel or use the number keys at the top to do the same thing. But it’s mainly just getting used to the layout there’s not too much advice I can give other than that, so just try keyboard and mouse if you feel like it and get yourself comfortable with the layout of all the buttons, over time it does become muscle memory so you shouldn’t have too much problems after a while.
Mouse and keyboard is better, just stick with it, keep playing and you’ll get used to it. Like riding a bike
Nice!
That’s cool! I would use controller.
You should play with Controller on your Mac ️
Love you Lamar
67
I say if you're used to controller use controller. If you want to use mouse and keyboard go for it. Take your time and learn mouse and keyboard if you want?
Play how you want to play
6 7LOL️
How tf do people just send you stuff how do i sign up ?
Why does gaming on a Mac feel weird
learn keyboard and mouse while play on controller
I would just stick to controller but Lamar why would you get rid of a PC and Switch to a Mac to play video games? What they got like 3 games on Mac now?
Gaming on Mac is not really a thing everything on pc
lammmmar!
I can't tell that clearly from the video, but it looks like you're using your index finger on the W key. 

Make sure you use your middle finger on W and your index on D, with your ring finger on A.

Clean your screen man!!
Oobe means out of box environment or experience depending on who you ask. It's basically just away to setup third party software for system builders.
can't do that no more :(
I had to do that today for my friends pc because he was switching from amd to Intel so we had to install windows to his new system but was a hole thing.
How is this the leading operating system???
Clean your monitor screen bro
anti consumer bs
start ms-ch:localonly
This command prompt bypasses the need for that annoying restart you triggered.
I had windows 10 then upgraded and still have a local account
That Windows 10

You know what would be easier. If Microsoft didn't do this bullshit with its os.
Dude, clean up your screen before you fill it

So for context, this used to bemy older brother's room. The problem ismy brother moved out a decade ago. Andsince then, we've just been using thisroom to pile up all of our junk. Andbecause my room has no more space for agaming setup, especially with my gamingsetup taking up all that space, Ifigured I'd just build my second gamingsetup in here. And as you guys may havealready seen, this room needs a lot ofwork. So before we do anything else, weneed to clean this room. And then I'llshow you guys my vision.[Music]Okay, so the room already looks a lotbetter and all the clothes are picked upand put in laundry baskets. So now thereal work starts. So basically my p Sobasically my plan So basically my planYou know what? Let me just show you guysthe vision. Okay, so as you guys cansee, this is the area that we're workingwith. I'm going to be taking this TVstand and sliding it a little bit closerto the left. And this whole area righthere is going to be cleared out. Yeah.I'm going to take these two toy boxesand put them in the closet. And thenthis little like nightstand right here.I'm going to be taking this putting itover here and then putting the printeron top of the nightstand. So, like Isaid, we got a lot to work with. Butbetter late than never.[Music]Bro, genuinely only one might genuinelyonly one might fit in here. Bro, I don'tknow if I'll be able to put them both inhere.Okay.Okay.Y'all didn't see that.[Music]Okay, this mouse pad got to go. Thiskind of looks ugly.Okay, printerplugged in.Boom. This already looks a lot better.I'm going to move these eventually, soignore the clothes. But first, I justwant to focus on the setup. Nightstandover here. Junk in there. Closet's stillfully accessaccessible. Okay. Well, now we're justmaking clutter. So, this whole area iscleared out. And now I'm going to bemoving this uh nightstand a littlefurther to the left to see if I'll haveroom. And a lot of you might be askingthe games. Room for what? Room for thedesk. Okay, so I've officially cleanedup the entire room. I haven't cleaned upthe little mess that was underneath thenightstand. So, now we're going to betalking about today's partner, FlexisSpot. So, now that I'm done witheverything else, it's finally time tostart building the actual setup. And thefirst and probably most important thingfor the setup is the desk, which isexactly where Flexis Spot comes in, thepartner of today's video. This mighttake a while, so let's get started.[Music]So, for my desk, I decided to go withFlexis Spot because I've been seeingtheir desks all over social media. Theylook great for what my setup trulyneeds. The color I went with is thebamboo top and the white frame to matchthe room and to match the theme that I'mgoing with, which stay tuned becauseit'll be revealed soon. So, this is theFlexis Spot E6 dual monitor desk. Whatmakes this desk the perfect fit is thefact that it can lift up to 333 lbs. Andyeah, I mean lift, not hold, becausethis desk is a desk that can rise up anddown depending on whatever mood you'rein.Yo, this is actually kind of scary.We're going back down.Dude, this is actually so cool. So, ifyou're in a more productive mood and youfeel like standing up while doing yourwork, you can do that. If you want tosit really low to the ground forwhatever reason, you can do that. Ipersonally think I'm going to be usingthe standing desk feature a lot becauseI love to stand up while I do my work,especially when I edit my videos. And itcan also withstand the lift of 355 lbsup to 20,000 times because of its 28,000PSI. And because it also comes withwheels, you can attach them and roll itaround your room if you do want tochange up the location of your setuppretty easy. But overall, this desk is avery good desk, and I probably wouldhave went with this first if I wouldhave known about it. This desk ishonestly a very good desk and the sizeof it is also very impressive. And to behonest, when I build more setups in thefuture, I'm probably going to go withFlexis Spot. And the best part is thatyou get a 10-year warranty on the deskand the motor and a 2-year warranty onthe control panel and the electronics.Anyways, I just want to say thank youFlexispot for partnering with me andallowing me to be able to do what I'mdoing currently. But let's get back tothe game. So, it's been 2 days since Ilast did anything to the setup. So,today we're going to be going to Targetand just other stores. And I'm justgoing to be looking for decorations.Keep in mind though that I already havea lot of decorations here. So, I'm notsure how many decorations I'll bebuying. But if there's one thing I knowfor a fact I'm gonna need to get is somefake plants and a MacBook stand becausethis setup will be powered by my MacBookfor now. So I'll get dressed with me togo to Target and other storespotentially like I just said. Okay,let's go. Okay, so I'm not going to lie.I'm already wearing some pretty niceshorts, so I'm just going to try to finda shirt to go with the shorts. Honestly,I'm probably just going to go with thismessy jersey. I don't really have a lotof nice shirts right now. And the shirtthat I was just wearing isn't likereally cropped, so it looks weird. Andthen for jewelry, I'm going to go withthis little cross. Okay, hear me out.So, for the shoes, I'm going with theseum Nikeretro. But, like I said before, it'stime to go to Target. So, let's freakinggo. Also, I'm probably not going to uhtalk in Target because I'm still notcomfortable with recording in publicyet, but I will talk to you guys once Iactually get into the store potentially.So, let's go.>> Okay, so it's officially been a daysince I went to Target and got all thesupplies. So now it's finally time tostart building the actual setup. I thinkthe first thing on the list shoulddefinitely be the monitor. So we'regoing to start with that.[Music][Applause][Music]>> Okay, so I just put the monitor on andput the MacBook down. And I'm not goingto lie, this looks so good already. Ihaven't even added anything. And nowthat I'm done with all that, I've got toput all the peripherals on and connectthe monitor to the MacBook. So that'swhat work. So that's what we're going tobe doing next. So like I said before, Iwant this setup to be more cozy andaesthetic versus my gaming setup is justRGB all in your face 24/7. So I decidedto go with this mouse pad, but I mightchange it in the future. Probably will.But I found the solution because thiskeyboard literally matches this mousepad. Like there's not another keyboardout there that matches this mouse pad asgood as this one. So it worked out. Likeliterally look at this. You have theblue, you have the white, and you havethe gray. Wo! Kind of. Yeah, this isperfect. For the mouse, I've chose thislittle row cap mouse because I feel likeout of all the mouses, because out ofall the mouses I have, this one feelsthe greatest in terms of comfortability.And because it goes out on the sides alittle bit more, it'll be a lot morecomfortable for me when I'm editing onthis setup and even when I want to playgames that are more chilled instead ofcompetitors. So, it's been a couplehours since I last talked to you guys.And the reason is because I thought Ihad an adapter to connect the monitor tothe Mac, but unfortunately, I couldn'tfind it. But now that I'm back, as youguys can see, I was able to successfullyconnect the monitor to the MacBook. I'mnot going to lie, I don't really likethis mouse because it keeps changingcolors and it's like really ugly. I likethe design of the mouse, but I don'tlike the RGB. So, I'm going to changethat right quick. Unfortunate update. Icouldn't find another mouse. So, now I'mstuck with this ugly mouse until I buy anew one. And trust me, I will be buyinga new one. But moving on from that, nowthat I have all the peripherals and themonitor set up, it's finally time tostart adding the decorations. So, forthose of you who remember when Iactually went to Target and bought abunch of decorations, I got a fake plantand then I got a really cool lamp. So,I'm going to be adding those as well assome other things that I just don't usefor my main gaming setup. Unboxing time.start the clip. Don't Don't add that in.All right, so welcome to the gamesTarget unboxing.First up, we have this beautiful plant.And I don't think I showed you guys thesecond thing, but I got this really coollooking lamp. I wanted this setup to bemore like aesthetic and cozy. So, Iwanted to get something cozy. This isdefinitely cozy. All right, so I'mthinking I want to put this right here.And because the cables are going to beshowing on this side, I'm going to putthis right here. Oh my gosh, I'mcooking.[Music][Music]Not going to lie, I thought the lamp wasgoing to be brighter, but I like thatit's not brighter. Like, let me turn offthese lights. Oh, yeah. That's Yo,that's actually so cozy. I better notsee any comments saying, ""Where did thegames go?"" That's not That's not That'snot funny. All right, I think now I needto change the wallpaper. All right, so Ialso got this monitor light bar, and Idon't really use it in my setup thatmuch because I don't have enough roomfor it. So, I figured why not put it inhere. Yo, the plant strap, the plantmight have been the strat. It's coveringup every cable. No, man. Boom. Yep. Welike it. We like it. We love You love tosee it. Yeah, that looks so nice. Allright, I'm going to go see if I can findanything else to add to this room. Idon't know if you guys see the vision ornot, but you see this? You notice howthis is orange and yellow and this isyellow. So, what if what if I take thislight and put it behind the plant togive the plant more of a glow? You knowwhat I mean? All right, we're going totry right now. I don't know. It lookskind of tacky. I feel like if it wasjust like a underglow, it'd be better,but it's like I don't know. I'm going tolet you guys decide in the comments. Ifyou guys like the vibe, let me know. Andif I see a comment with a good amount oflikes on it, I'll keep it. Now that Ihave everything set up, it's finallytime to But now that I have everythingset up, it's finally time to do the It'stime for the montage. Yeah, that's whatit's called. Let's run the montage.Before I run the montage, though, I dowant to say thank you guys for all thesupport you guys have been giving me.I'm honestly going to give it an eightjust because there's no PC, but I likethe vibes and I like the theme that it'sgoing for. But thank you guys forwatching. Remember that Jesus loves youand we out.[Music]Yeah. Do it for the love, for the hate,for the sons and the faith. for thedrums and the baseless break. Somethingto make for the ones in the basementchasing the one to scrape. Hugs and thethanks. Not the funds in the bank.","aura thumbnail big dawg

ButI don't think it's going to be a hugeproblem since pretty much all I play isCounterstrike 2. But I will say I'mdying to try out the new Dune Awakeninggame. So, if anyone's been playing it,please let me know in the comments whatyou think about it and follow for theupdates.","1k isnt a budget build
That mini pc is my dream pc bro
Try not to look out of touch 2025: IMPOSSIBLE VERSION
$1,000 is mid range to high end, i'd consider around the $450-$600 price point to be budget, and everything in between is mid range
700 to 1000 dollars and ""budget build""? Bro, that's a dream pc for me. Mine current is 280 dollars
What are the specs on that $3000 build? From the looks of it, my $700 budget build will outperform it
ITX a BUDGET BUILD??????
Budget builds like the one in this video tend to be more expensive when bought onlime compared to building it yourself. My take is, if you cant build it yourself you are better off buying a high end PC compared to these so called budget builds which cost about the same or higher price when making an online purchase.
Buddy. 1,000 is NOT a budget build. That’s midrange.
Ditch it right over here!
700$ is mid range and anything under 550 is budget
What is that case? That gpu mount postition is dope!
bro 700-1000 is more than my entire pc setup pc monitor speakers amp mouse and keyboard combined falls at like 500 new
300-500 is a budget build
Dune Awakening is a really good game, the endgame has to be reworked a bit, because for solo players it's impossible to progress but overall goty 2025 for me
Can i have the pc you gonna ditch? Maybe just the cpu lol

Anyways,i think it looks nice
But i assume you have a very cool room
You shouldnt have any problems with it

Embrace it with a retro line available in golden oak and super yellowy walnut!
Love how within the span of 5 minutes I went from ""oh, not sure I'd want to be part of the first 150 due to the old desk legs"" to ""oooo custom rare Ed mount, only 150 made""
""Is anyone else injured?"" ""I got some sunburn..."" 
I have a feeling that even if Crazy Ed bought a new suit, it would be covered in blood by Sunday anyway. May as well wear the one you have.
Let Ed be Ed at GenCon
“ You rang “
Crazy Ed's Gencon attire is a Tshirt with a QR code. To what? Only Ed will know until people start scanning it
for the doors I'd want it hinged on the right so that the opening is toward me while I am sitting there.
Doug won the battle against the teenagers, but he lost the war to age...
Definitely with Crazy Ed on the vertical panelling for the doors being nicer...
Looking forward to see Ed and the Desks at GenCon
How do you say ""Dovetails"" without doing the ""Ducktales WOOHOO""
Crazy Ed is a god damn genius.
I'm so gonna get Crazy Ed to sign my WyrmLyfe shield that has his stamp on it!
I have an L-desk with a big back like that, I love the thing. It's getting old and could do with a replacement [Some parts are fancied up particle board], I'd get a Wyrmwood desk with a back like that. Don't even need the sit/stand hardware, gimmie some solid wood legs.
I think Doug was right about the weight issue. It's not just the weight of the top cabinet itself; you have to think about all the random stuff people will put into it.

Why not also have T Track on the backboard?
I swear to god if you don’t let Crazy Ed wear whatever he wants I’m gonna lose it.
Ooh now you have that whole cubby with the T-track above the desks. Just get rid of the sit/stand and put 4 normal nice legs on the desk and you might actually be able to sell some desks
I’m not sure why it said vertical boy. I definitely like the horizontal grain doors and backs better but…. I’ll bring the blood suit in hopes they let me wear it at least one day. I’m not sure the airlines will allow my spiked top hat though
I'm glad you have the pc mount, cable management is super important, I like the idea of over head t-track but I think Doug is right it should be two cross bords to mount other things to instead of a solid panel. I would look at compatability with Vasa wall mounts and arms
Handles on the doors should go the same orientation, regardless of tall or short cupboard. Don't care which way, but pick one!
There's a part of me that wants aag rack on the back of the top desk thing. I'd make all my stationary organizers mad rack compatible
I'm dedicating this to Crazy Ed's sunburn
Can you show a side by side that has Jason's initial vision with what the desk has become?
Let go Crazy Ed!!!
Dovetails... woo-oo
That reveal at 5:09 tho, what showmanship
So when i was inquiring wirh customer service, i was informed as someone who had already placed an order. The order would take 4 months, so sometime in September to get one of the new desks due to the base being out 4 months
LMAO

""carbon fiber""
Is the desk too crazy? Absolutely not! It's exactly what your desks needed - more options and more modularity!

PS - sorry about your foot woes, Johann.
I think crazy ed splattered blood suit at gencon would be awesome
I think a wall mounted shelf that has the underside T-track is more practical and desirable. You could put it anywhere in the office too and have another adjacent product line that uses the same cubbies
You missed the opportunity to go “Dovetails Oh Woohoo” in the Ducktales theme
I love horizontal grain, but that makes me want continuous grain across the doors…
Honestly? I really kinda like the big, classic office desk hutch vibe. As long as it didn’t add too much extra cost, I’d probably add it on myself.
The lines on the hutch are not appropriate for the desk style. Get rid of the curves and make the edge thickness at least appear similar to the desk. Maybe even complete with a mag track. Otherwise, I love the idea of a hutch that can be mounted to in the top and the back.
He can get the comments, when he puts feetpicks on the internet.
You should be making a Danish style modular shelving system. Just think of all the possibilities and customization. It could integrate with both the desks and its cubbies/cabinets all of the gaming table accessories. I can think of 100 Ideas and integrated setups, it could be the solution to so many things.
Desk is just the right about of crazy, especially since the desk hood can be an add-on.
does the keyboard drawer work while the desk is tilted?
the back board or low back board would be an issue for the Screen monitor arms that alot of people use that clamps to the edge of the desk but the rest looks great
love the desk
Use Aluminum Quad-T extrusion for the posts, some sort of web mesh / extrusion rails on the sides and back for rigidity, use part of a desk top with the magnet rail and T track as the TOP of the hutch, and have some 'clip in' wood covers to help blend it all together. T Track mounted lights would be cool there too for people who stream and such...
Vertical gal, here. And I hope Johann’s foot heals quickly!
I know this newer format is better for you guys, and more product focused, but boy do I miss the daily vlogs.
MOAR DESK!
6:33 the handles being centered on the door and being at different heights just looks sooooo uggos
Asking for Johann foot love is crazy!
I would prefer to have a floating shelf with the T track above my monitor, rather than having that whole clunky top thing. That would keep it sleek and sexy.
8:45 what? No magnetic rail at the top of the backboard??
The desk is not crazy enough yet
Desk Topping shelf for the win
Save Johann's feet! Save Doug's knees! Vertical grain all daaaaaay.
Vertical > Horizontal
How about a resolute sytle desk with the eagle being a dragon, each pannel has a different D&D style character (wizard, owl bear, warrior). The inbetween design can be axes, arrows, fire, bows and spears.
Yeah... just look at the Magnus Pro XL and the Corsair desk and see how they mounted their pegboards and monitor mounts and T rails and stuff. Build like that. Metalwork is fine, and you could always have wood to cover over it if you really wanted to be precious about it. You want your structure to be light and thin? Use metal and disguise it with wood. It's not like the desk doesn't have metal legs. Offer a metal version, offer a wood sheathe for it.
Honestly, love the hutch design.
Dovetails? Woo-oo.
Cat Tower Please!! Would love to see what you guys can come up with. I am sick of how ugly/awkward most cat towers are.
Please look into a computer desk which doesn't have the sit/stand legs and doesn't tilt. I'm a basic bitch and only want a normy computer desk.
Gute Besserung Johann
For once I agree with Doug, aim it at the streamer, gamer, utilitarian
Wall mount PC on the Backboard? rather than Monitor on backboard, with monitor from T-track or triple monitor on backboard?
I think the desk is coming along great and if I wasn't such a broke ass then I would be buying one. I do really like the idea of the T- track up high and a surface to mount your computer monitors to is a great idea and another way to hide the cable management.
There are no cool kis at the church picnic
Where Jason be at with the design of these?
i think your getting into scope creep with these desks just adding and adding and adding. it all looks amazing but also gotta stop at some point to sell a product lolz
...Cat/Dice Towers?
Vertical gang
Can we get foot pics of Johann's injured foot so we can send his foot some love? Asking for a friend.
I still want an L option
Why does Doug keep trying to impart religion in his household when he is clearly not a christian person? Maybe he wants to have even more conflicts with his kids when they become adults...
How long is the return?
yeah seems like it might be heading towards too crazy.
Serious question: Does Johann speak german with the amish and do they have good bread (for a german )?
yes
Can haz moar cat furniture pleaze.
I vote BLOOD SUIT!!!
Johann foot love? Didn’t think it was that kind of channel but OK.
Who even uses a keyboard drawer now a days? Just a waste of space and a knee knocker.
Great work showing Bobbie less and getting Doug to say less dumb things.
Not a fan of the over cabinet - looks old fashion
I'm dedicating this comment to Doug's knee
vertical better ;)
You all have come full circle. You were a niche wood game accessory company that bought a custom huge skew furniture company; and in the subsequent years you have built more and more skews with wide spectrum on customizable furniture….the desk is too much and you all get bogged down in features that make it impossible to fulfill.
just make a desk.. get rid of the lift and just make a desk
I'm dedicating this comment to Johann's feet ligaments

I have both the veryexpensive one from Elgato as well as theone from Fifine. The only difference Inoticed is that the Elgato one cablemanagement log is magnetic. It does makeit very easy to like play around withyour cables, but if you're not going totouch it, who cares? Low profile armsare so nice because you don't hog up somuch desk space. As you can see, it fitsperfectly under my monitor. This is agas spring mount, and I definitelyrecommend those over other ones becauseyou can adjust it any way you want.

I'veactually done like a short video onthis, and this headset is actuallyreally good. It's literally less than$30. It's like wireless or you can dowired and it just has a bunch of optionsthat are really, really good for theprice. But yeah, taking it out of thebox, as you guys can see, we got all ofthis stuff for the headset right there.It also comes wrapped in two differentthings. And then right here, we canactually get the headset out and you canjust see for yourselves. Like it justlooks really good, but you can't reallyexpect that much. And it's supercomfortable. Like literally, it alsolooks pretty good, I think. And for aheadset, it's definitely not bad by anymeans. And then next up, we actually gota white mouse as well. And right here isthe Razer Essential Mouse from Amazon.It's literally I think less than $20,but it's a super super clean mouse asyou guys can see. Honestly, I have usedit before actually, but it is reallygood and it's only 20 bucks. And forthis setup that we're building, guys,right around $700. Like, I'm telling youguys, everything in here you're going toenjoy a lot if you choose to get ityourself. And then next up, we're goingto go with the keyboard. And this isalso a white theme. And as you guys cansee, we have a lot of white peripheralsright here. Um, that is on purpose. Thesetup is going to look really good, likeI said. But yeah, this is the TK68SEon Amazon. Literally right around $20.And when I tell you guys you can'treally spend $20 anywhere else for akeyboard besides right here, I mean it.Like literally, this has red switches.You guys can hear it. It also comes withthis detachable cable along with akeycap puller that clearly works as youguys can see. And then you can also justtake a look at the red switches rightthere.

And I thought that I was deletingjust temporary files and stuff, but itwas actual footage that I needed. Andyeah, it was completely gone. Like noteven in the recycle bin or in any backupfiles. It was literally gone. So I endedup using this software calledWondershare Recover It. And somehow itbrought everything back. It was theoriginal full quality file. There waslike no corruption or weird glitches. Itwas like they were never even deleted inthe first place. I honestly don't knowhow the software recovered the files,but I'm so glad it did. It works withover 1,000 different file types,including videos, photos, and projectfiles, and can even recover fromexternal drives, SD cards, or even crashsystems. It's super easy to use, and itactually shows you a little previewbefore you recover anything, which isvery nice. But yeah, if you've everdeleted files by accident or lostanything due to crashing, recover itmight actually save you. I'm going toleave a link in the description if youguys are interested in getting it, butit definitely helped me. But yeah, Imean, it's really solid. Like usually,like I remember years ago, mechanicalkeyboards used to cost a lot more.Literally only cost 20 bucks if not alittle less than that. And next up, weactually have a mic. So, we do actuallyhave a mic in this setup. It wouldn'treally be a complete gaming setup. Imean, I know the uh headset does have amic on it, and it actually is prettydecent, but you know, having a dedicatedmic is always great. And, you know, yourvoice sounds crisp and clear. Like, eventhough we don't necessarily need onebecause this headset does literally havea mic on it and it works pretty decent.Um, you know, it's in the budget. It'swithin 700 bucks, so why not get it? Imean, you guys can spend this anywhereelse if you want to, like for a monitorarm or something, but I'm going to showyou guys this mic. This is the FifineAM8 microphone. Very, very good quality.I'm not going to lie. Put on the bassjust like that. And the whole thing doeslight up as you guys will see a littlebit later on. But yeah, this is the micright here. Like I said, it's a verygood budget microphone. Literally, Idon't know what else you could getbetter for around that price. Yeah, italso does come with a detachable cablejust like the uh keyboard did and theheadset actually. So, the only thingwithout a detachable cable here isliterally the mouse, which is prettyfunny. Yeah. Now, finally, we can get onto the more interesting part of this uhsetup right here, which is the monitor.And this is a Titan Army 144 hertzgaming monitor. It is 24 1/2 in. So,definitely a pretty decent size.Although, you can probably find onethat's 27 in. This one is under $100.So, I mean, for the budget, this is likea really good monitor. And we're goingto be able to see 144 FPS on this thing.So definitely not bad at all, especiallywith the computer we're getting, whichI'll actually go over right now. And Iam going to have to unbox it cuz it isbrand new in the box. As you guys cansee, it is always hard to get thesethings out of the box sitting down. SoI'm going to have to make you guys widerand take it out this way. But yeah,before I take it out, it is fromBlackout Computers. It is the Eclipsegaming PC. So we'll take this out. Firstthing that you guys see in the boxthough is just a couple of things. Thisis like a troubleshoot guide right here.This right here is some otheraccessories, I'm pretty sure. And thenwe have the PC. It is literally alwaysso difficult with one arm. Well, if thecomputer doesn't perform very good inthis video, I think I know why. But mybad, guys. But I was going to say thatI'm just going to put it upside down soit can actually come out pretty easy.So, there we go. Get that box out ofhere. It does have a lot of packagingaround it, so it's definitely not goingto be damaged or anything like that.Dude, I am dropping everything rightnow. There we go. We finally get thelast piece of packaging open. Andactually not the last piece ofpackaging, but you guys can see theaesthetic of this computer actuallylooks really good. The funny thing iswith all these white peripherals, we dohave a black PC, but it's funny cuz theydo actually have a white version of thisPC as well. And I'm pretty sure it'slike the same price, but I didn't wantto get everything white, you know. Uh wealso do have a black mic, so it kind ofhelps it. But yeah, this is the PC. I'lltake the packaging out and show you guysthe RGB.Dude, this song is stuck in my head,guys. Hold on. I have to play it for asecond. Hopefully I don't getcopyrighted. I'll play it for like 1second. I'm going to play like literallylike one second of it cuz I don't want achance to get copyrighted. Butthat song right there, you guys knowwhat I'm talking about. Anyways, back tothe PC. It's actually not even like asong. It's like a remix that someonemade in like whatever software they callit on PC that they make music and beats,whatever. This is the packaging righthere. Go ahead and take this out. Andguys, if I if there was like a recordfor how much packaging you can have in aPC for it not to get damaged, I swearit's literally this PC right here. Butyeah, looks very good. Hold on. Let meplug it in. All right, it's all pluggedin right now. So, we can actually powerit on hopefully. Power supply. My myfault. Rookie mistake. All right, so nowit's actually plugged in. We can turn iton. And yeah, you guys can see the RGBon it definitely looks uh like prettygood. Again, it's literally only $500.And this PC's actually been on sale alot. So, like for $450 and stuff. Um,all black as you guys can see. Even theGPU, like if we zoom in, even the GPUhas this like back plate on it thatmakes it look really good. And the wholething just all blacked out. Sodefinitely really good aesthetically.Yeah, obviously aesthetics aren'teverything in a computer and youdefinitely want the specs to be prettydecent for what you're paying for. Sothis PC right here actually does have anRX 580 GPU. Um, very decent, especiallyfor 1080p gaming and for a pre-builtcomputer under $500. It also has twosticks of 16 GB of RAM as well as a 1TBTE SSD and an i74790CPU. And instantly you guys are probablylike, ""That's a really old CPU."" Buthonestly, this CPU handles gaming prettywell, especially like low settings 1080pgames. Definitely pretty well still in2025. Um, and you can't literally gosearch for yourself on Amazon right nowand try to find one that's much betterthan this for $500. Like, you literallycan't for pre-built gaming PCs. And youguys will see later on in this video,like you still get well over 100 FPS andthere's not really many issues at all. Ido want to go over these right here.These have been here the whole time andI forgot to go over them, but these aremy own mouse pads which we will be usingfor the setup. They are only 25 bucksand they just make the entire setup. Anysetup you have looks so much better. Um,but yeah, only $25. They're my owncustom mouse pads. I have a ton ofdesigns like this black one, this darkblue swirl one, this light blue swirlone, this white swirl one, and a bunchof other designs. Um, I'm not sureexactly which one to use for this setup.Maybe the white one. I don't know. Yeah.Also, if you guys do want one of thesemouse pads and you don't want one of thedesigns that are already out, you cancustomize your own literally bycustomizing, meaning I can makeliterally anything you can think aboutand put it on a mouse pad for you foryou to buy at no extra charge at all.So, it'll still be $25 if you just joinmy Discord and DM me actually willing tobuy it. So, yeah, definitely very good.They're very big and comfortable as youguys can see. But, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonnastop talking about everything and justgo ahead and get right into the gamingpart of this video and show you guys theentire setup all set up.All right, guys. We got everything setup right here. I also just want toquickly show you guys the microphonequality. So, I'll go over to switch toit right now. And as you guys can hear,it's a pretty good mic. Like I'm saying,the Fifine AM8 microphone. Definitelynot a bad choice at all if you'relooking to get into it. And thenobviously you have a bunch of uhlighting effects right here as you guyscan see while you're rotating throughthem. So yeah, it's a definitely apretty decent mic. Yeah, we're going togo ahead and get right into this game.The first game we're going to be playingis War Zone. I think we're going to beable to get pretty decent FPS. I'mhoping over 60, but there's only one wayto find out. So, let's go ahead and loadin. Right off the start loading in,we're literally getting 80 FPS. This isso good, dude. 60 FPS. Over 60 ishonestly insane. Like, anything over 60is great. There's like there's nostutters either. So, this is like apretty solid 60 fps. Not a stuttery 60fps, if that makes any sense. Oh my,dude. He scared me so bad because I wasjust about to say something. My mind wasnot in the game at all. I haveheadphones that are studio headphonesliterally cost like over $150. The DT990Pros. So, I know what good headphonesare and these are good like and I alsoknow what bad headphones are. Like Ihave like some Senzor SG500 cheap budgetheadsets and this is a really budgetheadset and it's also wireless and it'sreally good sound quality.[Music]Take him out. Oh my god, he just gotfaked out so bad. He just got faked outso bad, guys. Y'all saw that. Y'all sawthat IQ. I know y'all did. Let's go.Another person.He want the smoke as well, man. Hey,come and get it. Come and get it. Oneafter the other. Clearly, you guys cansee I'm having no issues playing thisgame at all. I don't even play War Zone,but I do know that I am able to, sothat's really what matters. Oh, out ofthe sky. Oh, you're lucky.[Music]Oh, I thought I was going to respond, soI didn't even say anything. I wasn'teven going to show that in the video.But hey, we got enough gameplay, Iguess. But yeah, anyway, we're going togo and get to the next game. I'm prettysure this PC can run a lot of games, sowe're going to find out. All right,guys. We just loaded into Valerant rightnow. I don't even know how much FPSwe're going to get. Over well, we'reaveraging 200 FPS in Valerant. That isamazing.Able to bop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.Dang it. Yeah, that's why we don't pullout our knives. Okay, guys. That's whywe don't pull out our knives. But thisis just a warm-up anyway. But over 200,like around 200 FPS is very good on likemy gameplay. Hold on. Let me redeemmyself. Let me redeem myself. Let meredeem myself. Come on. Let me redeemmyself.Okay. Kind of. There we go. That's alittle better. We're getting We'regaining on it. We're gaining on it alittle bit.We're gaining on it a little bit.[Music]But yeah, I mean, this is great. Likethis is PC is a pre-built PC. If youdon't want to build one or get a usedone, this pre-built computer, look atour FPS right now. 230. Like, not bad,man. Not bad at all. Wait, my Oh, comeon. Wow. I almost just had a lisp thereand I don't even have a lisp. There wego. Both them. Should I just talk like Ihave a list for the rest of the video?Come on, man.I guess not, guys.Bop,[Music]two, one.I'm all Forn. Oh, wait. I'm all Forn.Yeah, we're going into a different gamenow. Um, Fortnite. Why not Fortnite?Let's see how that runs. Uh, I have highhopes. It is an all black creative mapas you guys can see. Um, we are gettingLooks like the peak FPS we got was 280FPS in creative. I wonder like is thatchanges the more we go out or something?I don't know. Yeah, 280. I saw 280 max.Not bad at all. There's also literallyno input delay on this keyboard at all.Like I'm telling you guys, I can buildand I feel no input delay. This keyboardis really solid and it also feels reallygood. Those other games I wasn't likeable to use it super fast cuz they'renot, you know, super fast-paced games.But everything right now is amazing.Definitely worth the $700 in my opinion.literally everything I'm using.Literally no issues whatsoever. Likeyeah, I'm g just go ahead and take thisinto a game. We're averaging 200 FPSwhile building and stuff in creative,which is insane. So, let's see if we canget hopefully we can average around 120to 144 in game, especially with the 144hertz monitor. But yeah. All right,guys. I can't even stress this enough.We're getting 150 while we are literallygliding down. Like, that's amazing.There's people all over us, though,which I do not like. He's literallycamping somewhere. But look at the FPS,guys. Just take a moment to look atthat. That is so good. I need to getout. I don't have mats. Sorry. Oh mygosh. What an escape.I do not have mats to fight anybodyright now, unfortunately.Okay, spray and pray. Spray and prayworks sometimes, and that was sometimes.So, let's go. Oh my gosh, he's low. AndI'm getting third party. That is notgood. That is not good.[Applause][Music]6464 Okay, nice. No way. No way, brother.No way. I'm getting shot at someone. Ihave nowhere to land now, guys. Thismight be wraps. This is probably wraps.I don't know why the whole lobby istargeting me right now. I have nothing.Isbox them.Oh my goodness. That was such a goodkill, dude. Dude. Oh my goodness. He hada spaz as well. If he just hit me, wewere dead. What am I doing? Oh my gosh.I did not mean to do that.If he literally just hit me, we weredead there. What a kill.Oh my gosh. There's no way. There'sabsolutely zero way possible that justhappened. Oh my goodness. We are likethat. I'm telling you, that purple spatsaved me. I hit him for like 190.I don't know what to tell you guys, butthis PC seems to be fine. Didn't shoot.We're dead. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Wecouldn't win. My shotgun just didn'tshoot when I looked at him, cuz we wouldhave killed him there. I'm not going tolie. But yeah, this PC is very good. umover 144 fps consistently ishonestly that that exceeded myexpectations for this PC, but clearly itcan run some games. I'm going to do afew games super quickly just to show youguys how they run. But Fortnite,definitely check that one off the listas well. All right, guys. Rocket League,I'll show you guys the settings in asecond, but it's definitely runnable aswell. Like, it's not surprising thatit's runnable. Literally, all the othergames were. And this game does not taketoo much at all. So you guys can seethat uh if we go to here, this is mysettings. And honestly, like on anysingle PC, this is still the settingsI'm going to use in Rocket League, justcuz I don't like playing in highsettings on a game like this, just cuz,you know, the competitive advantage islow settings. Um, even in Rocket League,but I will show you guys what highsettings does look like and how itperforms. All right, so I'm going applythese settings right here. You guys cantake a look at them if you know RocketLeague. I guess they already appliedthat quick. Wow. Okay. I wasn'texpecting the PC to be that fast, butwe're still getting like the same FPS.Wow, that's actually kind of crazy.We're getting still 160 in RocketLeague. No issues at all. Definitelylooks good for the enjoyment of thegame. Not for competitive reasons,though. That's just how I've alwaysbeen. But yeah, we're going to go intothe next game. I'm going to show youguys Minecraft and how much FPSMinecraft can get. But all of thesegames are runnable. Like it seems ifthey're not AAA games, you're going tobe able to run them perfectly fine. Andeven some AAA games you can probablyrun. All right, I'm making a new worldright now. We see how fast it loads up.That's loaded in. We are getting over400 FPS. Wow. I mean, that is notsurprising, honestly. Almost 500. So,you can definitely run this game withsome high quality shaders. I'll show youguys my settings right now. This isthem. All right. Now, my thing. I alwayswant to test out maximum FPS. So, let'sgo. Whoa. Hold on. If we just look righthere.All right. 1,00 FPS. All right. Thatthat Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.Blackout PC. I was looking for somehorse armor or something, but look, morediamonds right here. More diamonds righthere. Wow,what a cave. What a cave. I think wejust sell more diamonds as well, maybe.All right, at the bottom of the worldright now. I really just want to see howmuch FPS we get looking down at it. Allright, so Minecraft FPS on this computermaximum 1343. I saw 1473. 1473 is thehighest FPS we can get in Minecraft. Idon't know why. I just wanted to dothat. But that's insane. I really don'thave any other games to really test foryou guys cuz most of you guys haveprobably played one of those gamesbefore and you know how good thecomputer is basing it off of that. Butyeah, I'm going go and go to the outroand tell you guys my final thoughts. Allright, so $700 and we're getting thisright here. Yeah, I'm not going to lie,that's a very good deal. Literally theonly thing you can do better is the PCby building one or buying one used. Butyou guys saw the performance. Like it'snot bad at all for a pre-built.Instantly people assume when you heari74790 it's so old 10 years old. Butyeah, but like how much FPS we werestill getting though. For me it reallywasn't an issue at all to have some goodgameplay and you know entertain you guyswith it. Yeah. I mean taking a look foryourselves like you guys can just seethe aesthetics is also really good on itas well. It's not like it's just somecheap put together PC. It has a blackback plate on it as well. Two sticks of8 GB of RAM and yeah just overall verygood. Not to mention the greatmicrophone, amazing headset, keyboard,mouse, monitor, mouse pad especially.It's just simply that good in myopinion.All this stuff will be linked down belowin the description. And also, if you'vedeleted any of your old videos oranything that you want, make sure tocheck out recover it uh in thedescription. The link will be there.Definitely a very useful software. Butyeah, this right here is the uh verse ofthe day. You guys can read that righthere. Um, yeah, remember that Jesus doeswant a relationship with you guys. So,just make sure to look into that. And,uh, yeah, also check out the videos hereand here if you're interested. Um, verygood videos. And I'll see you guys nextone.

Bro is showcasing 580 prebuilts
Can you do a bunch of a gaming set up? 1500
Been here since 1K great to see you evolve to 30K
Hello Fluxphy, My name is Mohab, and I’m a 13-year-old boy from Canada. I’ve been a huge fan of Fortnite for years, but I’ve never had the chance to play on a real gaming PC. Right now, I play on a school Chromebook that I had to borrow, using GeForce Now Experience just to get into matches. It’s super laggy, and the delay makes it really hard to improve or even enjoy the game the way I want to. But I keep playing anyway because I love it so much.

I’ve entered tons of PC giveaways from different content creators, hoping for a chance, but I’ve never won any of them. I know there are so many people out there asking too, and I don’t want to seem like I’m begging—but for someone like me, who comes from a family that can’t really afford something like a gaming setup, it would honestly mean the world.

Gaming is more than just fun to me—it’s where I feel the most confident, and it helps me escape when things get tough. You’ve already helped so many people, and even if nothing happens, just being able to message you gives me a little hope. Thank you so much for always being generous and inspiring so many kids like me to keep dreaming.
you improve day by day, underrated af
if you want more fps with an RX 580 you need a Ryxen 5 5400 or 5 5600
for 400 dollars that isnt a bad pc 80 fps on MW3?
I can get the pc?
I would get this computer, I'm not a pc gamer but it's good enough for my photography. One problem though, it uses windows 10 and I'm pretty sure it can't be upgraded to Windows 11. It's a shame because the price it good as well.

bro this is so relatable. Doing the ""checking-in""
I go up the stairs like that sometimes lol
When i grow up, I wanna be like Dino
Nah, he’s checking if he’s still allowed to sleep in the bedroom
The stair crawl is spot on, nice
He turn that staircase a catwalk
That walk back up there stairs says it all. I feel you
Putting hands on stairs while going up lmao i still do that sometimes
Ngl smthng primal about going up stairs on all fours
The walk back up the stairs is what does it all together lol using all fours for maximum efficiency
He make fence in his stair for protect his baby. What a responsible daddy gamer. Superb.
Bro is crawling back to his cave
A true man of classic stair walking indeed!
the pose is swag, but the crocs are hilarious
Goin up the stairs like a true gentleman
He should prepare her favourite snacks and drinks to fully 100% sure shes good
You still have the inner child in you. The vibe still vibing.
THE SWAG ️‍ THE SASS THE GOAT
Just me or did anyone else see his cheeks hanging out while he was going up the stairs
Bro out here walking like a supermodel , I wouldnt be surprised if he was one back then he has done it all after all
Lol. I can relate. It's a must. It is a message that I still care about you and ok you're fine, don't disturb me in my next match, lab yah!
Dude must be such a vibe to be around
I still don’t know why we do that, but it happens Checking-in just to say “Hi! Sup! Love you! Bye!”
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
checking in is part of main quest now for me
I would do the same thing
Relatable. Well actually, we check if they have things to remind us in case we forgot to throw out the garbage.
Did his pants fall down
That’s wasup ! sometimes people game and forgot about the real world so this is refreshing to see
I'm thankful for this versatile channel
my husband do checking on me after long game at his bat cave
I do this... finish one game, go check on the wife and kids with the obligatory ""need anything?"" Then go back to the PS5. Repeat every 2 - 3 games
Man nowadays I'm only gaming when both wifey and kid are asleep
Bro really on another level
That a good gamer and a good husband.

If your kid ask you if any chore needed to be done and do a patrol around the house before playing, that kid a good kid. Or this is just some asian stuff
I bet u don’t have a huge lego collection
The social check before a league launch, and then de 4 paw run up the stairs 1 min before start. Yea that's me
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Lol! I do check my wife before march starts too.
Checking on the fam while in deep game sessions is a must! You alive?? Good!
Maximum efficiency going up the stairs like that probably cause of that little model walk you gotta get back before the game starts!
Damn' u should wear the prada bag dino
I think dinos most feared scenario is electricity crisis..
Oh he's playing dota 2, long queues
Them wives who walk in the room chatting and know to say ""oh shit sorry you loading in rn? Oh you in the gulag...rah ima talk to you in a sec then..."" Or just ""is your mike on?""We know more game lingo than we'd care to learn but we also know it helps us work around it(if we aren't gamers ourselves lol)
Love is for luck. Most especially when you're always dead in FPS games.
pretty sure most of us climb the stairs like that
Guys do climb up stairs that way on occasion ngl
This channel is a variety show
The intermission mission
dinos the example of why they say marry a wife that understands and supports you
This dude’s shoulder height with the handrails
First Comment! - I also do this to check if I should play another game or not.
He is renewing his license to play like parking tickets
Im a pinoy, and literally i do the same thing. I guess is in our DNA
what is the best gaming laptop??brand
That was a zesty check-in
Was that an invite? If so. She took to long to decide.
He is wearing the same shorts for his entire life .
Cuz if shes chillin the next round finna be lit!
Dude this ""check-in"" is just filling the quota so you dont suddenly feel lonely and crash the game
Wait is it just me or while going up the stairs his shorts get pulled down
This is not a brat summer
He's the guy, checking fam is ol good before the match coz God knows when he'll be back.
LOL the crawl so the blood rush dosent end horribly going back up
What’s with the gate at the end of the stairs?
Loving it
Fantastic posing my man

I upload gaming tech reviews and share my gaming setup.","Hey guys, Moon Rider here. For today'svideo, I'm adding some streaming gear tothe gaming setup. And no, this isn't forthe sake of a review. I'm actually goingto start making gaming content on mysecond channel, which is something I'vebeen planning on doing for a while, butkept pushing it off for any reason myoverthinking brain could concoct. ButI'm not getting any younger, so today'sthe day I'm finally doing it. Also, I'vebeen thinking about switching out my PCcase, and today I started looking intosome options. I'll share those ideaswith you later on in the video. Allrighty, intro's over. Let's check outthat streaming gear. And I do usestreaming loosely because I'm notplanning on actually live streaming onYouTube or Twitch. I'll be recordinggameplay and editing the footage. Andbefore anyone in the comments suggestsit's more beneficial to live stream thanedit the footage, I totally agree, butI've got this whole hereditary facialtick thing going on that I'm notconfident enough to show off. So, thisis what I'll be adding into the setup.I've got the Emit S800 webcam, FifineSC3 audio mixer, and a newer productfrom Fifine, their Amplagame D6 streamcontroller. As much as I would love toreap the rewards from a DSLR camera, aproper one isn't in my budget. I have anold Canon EO70D, but it only shoots 60frames per second in 720 resolution and30 frames per second in 1080p.Meanwhile, I can get 60 frames persecond out of the S800 with 1080presolution or 30 frames per second with4K UHD. On top of that, the S800 isequipped with an 8 megapixel lens,half-in Sony sensor delivering f1.8aperture and focal length of 4.71 mm, aswell as smart features like phasedetection autofocus and time offlightdual autofocus that work in sync todeliver faster, more preciseautofocusing, which should be great whenI'm getting all hyper. It also has twoomniirectional microphones, but I won'tbe using those. All right, time to picka home. I really don't want this side ofmy room showing up in any of my contentreally. So, I'm going to position it ontop of my Edifier speaker. I just spend15 minutes searching for one of my oldmini tripods only to remember the S800can angle out from its stand and pivotand it's the perfect height for what Ineed. Next is the Fifine SC3 audiomixer. I know compared to other audiomixers, this one is more on the basicend of the spectrum. And that's totallyfine because for my intended purpose,I'm not looking for any advancedfeatures. All I'm going to use it for isplugging in my headset and monitoringthe mic. Meanwhile, the headset I willbe using is the wired Razer Black SharkV2X. Now, I adore this headset. I pickedit up from Target for $40 about 2 yearsago after purchasing my Series X. Itactually retails for $50, but isfrequently discounted to 40. It's sogood and so affordable, even my wifepicked one up. Anyway, the mic on thisbad boy is epic. I'm actually recordingvoice over through it right now. Itfeatures a hyper clear cardioidmicrophone offering greater speechpickup and noise cancellation, which I'mreally hoping will work for tuning outany keyboard smashing. Otherwise, Iwon't be able to use my Gravitar MercuryK1 light, which would be sad days. Butat least I have options. Now, the lastpiece of gear isn't as necessary as theother two, but I'm hoping it'll offersome convenience in the form of shortcutkeys. It's called the Amplame D6 StreamController, and it's Fifine's responseto the Elgato Stream Deck, which I neverowned or tested cuz I could neverjustify the $150 price tag. Meanwhile,Fifine Stream Controller sells foraround $80. So, around half the price ofthe Stream Deck, especially when it's onsale. Of course, I didn't buy this oneeither since Fifine sent it over for meto try out. So, let's get it set up andassign some shortcuts.I assigned shortcuts to my most visitedwebsites like YouTube and Upbeat where Iget all my music for videos.Productivity shortcuts like my YouTubechannel, Libre Office Writer, and myprojects folder. So, I'll be using twoprograms to record gameplay and facecam.OBS will be used for recording myfacecam and GeForce Experience forrecording gameplay. Real quick, let meexplain why I'm using two differentprograms instead of just OBS. I had agaming channel a few years ago and Iused OBS for both gameplay and facecamrecording. The problem was every once ina while OBS wouldn't record gameplayaudio or the audio would sound horriblydistorted and I would have no way ofknowing that was happening in real time.Even if I did an audio test run prior toplaying, the audio would record normallythe first time and the second time I'dhit record, it would get messed up and Iwouldn't know until playing it back anhour and a half or 2 hours later and allthat time would be wasted. I've neverhad issues recording my voice withFacecam with OBS and I've also neverexperienced issues recording gameplaywith GeForce Experience. So, that's whyI use both. That being said, I'm goingto try to set two of those shortcutbuttons to start and stop recording inOBS and GeForce Experience. and the tworemaining buttons can serve as shortcutsto opening up those programs. Let's seeif it can be done. So, this is Fifine'scontrol deck software. The drop-own menuon the right includes pre-installedDiscord, OBS, and Streamlab shortcuts,as well as various Toolbox, audioplayer, and Operational Flow shortcuts.The OBS dropdown doesn't seem to have anapp launcher shortcut, so I'll tryselecting the toolbox menu and draggingover open an app, then selecting OBSfrom the app name dropdown.When I try to drag record from the OBSdrop-own menu, it prompts me to enter aserver password, which I have no ideawhat that is. So, instead, I assigned akey combo shortcut within OBS to startand stop recording. By opening thetoolbox menu and dragging over hotkey, Ican assign left alt + zero. And when Ipress the button on the streamcontroller, OBS starts and stopsrecording. Now, I could probably do thesame thing for GeForce Experience, butsince it always seems to be accessibleby pressing left Alt + Z, I'll drag overhotkey from toolbox, assign left alt +Z, and it opens. Lastly, let's drag overhotkey again, and this time assign leftalt + F9 since that's the shortcut usedwithin the software.Oh, and it seems I still have a vacantspace, so let's fill that with mute.As for custom button icons, I downloadan image, usually a program logo, byclicking the cog at the top right ofthis box. You can either select openicon library to choose one of Fifine'scolorful options, uh, but for somethingmore specific like a program, clickselect local file, and then click yourdownloaded image. From there, you canshrink it down and click okay whenyou're done, and you've got a custombutton icon.[Music]Also, I just want to point out that theD6 allows you to create up to 10 pagesfor loads of custom shortcuts. Toalternate between these pages, you canclick the Fifine control deck dropownand drag over previous page or next pageto act as a page turner.Now, let's talk the monitor andlighting. Starting with the monitor,being an ultra wide isn't ideal for gamerecording, but there are a few reasonsI'm going to carry on using it. One, Idon't have room in my current layout foranother 16x9 aspect ratio monitor, letalone in landscape mode. Two, I can'tsacrifice the utility of an ultrawidejust to record gaming videos. It's fartoo valuable to have for video editing,multitasking, and gaming in a 21x9aspect ratio when I'm not recording. Asfor lighting, no, I don't have anystudio or streamer lights. They're notin my budget and I do have this GOIglide beam overhead that is very brightwhen set to bright white. I suppose myFifi microphone is worth an honorablemention. Why am I using a headsetmicrophone when I have a dedicated mic?With how my desk is currently laid out,the only place I have for the lowprofileboom arm is far off on the right side ofmy desk. When I swing the mic over,it'll be in front of the camera. I couldswitch things up, but at the moment, Ilike my desk layout the way it is,except I would still like to swap outthat PC case, which I'll touch on injust a moment. Depending on how thingsgo with my second channel, maybe I willalter the desk layout to be bettersuited for streaming or recording. Ifthat happens, maybe I'll go back to anLes. Now, earlier I mentioned that I'vebeen thinking about switching out my PCcase. Well, this is what I havecurrently. Corsair 6500X in white withbamboo. I picked this case up solely foraesthetic purposes. Prior to this, I hada Lean Lee O11 Dynamic Evo, which Iabsolutely loved, but it was black and Imissed having a white case. The bambooand lack of a corner pillar are prettymuch the two features that sold me onthis case, even though I could have justupgraded to an O1 Vision or compact. Butno, I wanted the white and bamboobecause I thought it would fit perfectlyin my setup. But here's the problem.It's too big. It's tall. It's wide andit's ridiculously deep. I mean, look howfar back my side fans are. But I have tohave them there or I can't utilize thepass through grommets. I also don'tremember seeing so much cable slack inmy old O11, but in this I see so much.And it used to be even worse before Iadded the vertical GPU mount. Andspeaking of the vertical GPU mount, I'mforced to extend it out this far becauseotherwise I can't get the display cablesthrough to the ports because it hasthese horizontal bars on the back thatget in the way of the cables. But I onlydiscovered that hindrance recently. Mynumber one reason for still consideringa new case is the sheer size. It's sotall I don't want to place it on theright side of my desk or it'll block mywindow view. It's a beautiful case, butit limits what I can do with an alreadylimited space. At the moment, I'm in themarket for a white case for around $100,but ideally no more than $120. I'm on atight budget for this one, and I washoping to replenish my wallet withprofits from selling my 6500X. I wasdrawn into the Lean Lee O1 VisionCompact, but it is on the high end of mybudget and it's not much smaller thanthe 6500X, which wouldn't really solvemy biggest issue, just slightly lessenit. Another case under consideration isthe NZXT H6 Flow. It comes in white, ismostly an open design, it's only $19.99or $89.99 if it stays discounted, andit's noticeably smaller than the 6500X.By comparing measurements, I'veconfirmed it's 17.13 in tall compared to19 1/2, 16.34 in deep compared to 18.5,and 11.3 in wide compared to 12 and 3/4.And from what I've read so far, it seemsto receive praise for offering optimalair flow. And I have an RTX 380 andRyzen 75800X, so I need a case with goodair flow. The only downside I see is Iwould need to purchase two 140 mm fansfor the floor because none come includedand 120 mm fans will not fit. So, that'swhere I'm currently at with my PC. I'msure there are other options out there,so I'll do some more research beforemaking a purchase. I want to be moremethodical this time and not just jumpon a case for aesthetics. But, if any ofyou have any suggestions based on mycriteria, please drop them down in thecomments. And if you made it this far,thank you for watching. I know thereweren't too many changes this time andabsolutely no aesthetic changes. I'mhoping to keep the current setup untilthe new year and then do a 2026 refresh,but the desire for me to rip down mysetup and build a new one can changewith the wind. It's happened severaltimes, but for now, I'm happy,comfortable, and I do feel inspired inthis space, and that's what's importantto me in a gaming setup. As for theadditions I made in this video and mysecond channel, I guess we'll see howoften I post and if that takes off atall. For now, I just want that channelto be my place to let loose, be moremyself, and have fun. No productresearch or outlining, no scripts, justme playing the games that bring me joyand sharing those experiences withwhomever wants to join. If you'reinterested in checking out my gamingchannel, it's a casual AF gamer, aptlynamed because I'm no pro at any of thegames I play. I just play to have fun.And the games I'll most likely beplaying are Modern Warfare 3 andBorderlands, maybe with a bit ofFortnite, and of course, anything elsethat comes along that I want to play andshare with you. Anyway, that's it forthe video. Thank you so much forwatching. later.","thank you, this video helps so much

Whole house is for wife
Garage is for Dino
Flexed the house
The best airbending ever.
Dino is a gift himself and he is priceless
This is the fastest home tour i have ever seen
Wait ...
He flexed the baby too
HunterXHunter is a massive w
The kitchen alone was enough
This made me feel better. Can’t always get something for her but the biggest thing I got her was a house.
I've never been called broke in so many ways and so many hand gestures in my life
Those who saw the dog

If he rich do like
Now thanks for the quick House tour
Man the one smsleeping on that crib is the most expensive gift.
I cant believe he's gifted her the rights to hxh ants saga
Dino really went there this time...Would love to see your wife's reaction to this video...lol!! Better call the Chevy guys once more
EVERYTIME THAT OMINOUS SOUND GOES OFF IM CALLING THE PERSON WHO MESSAGED THAT THE B WORD EVERY OMINOUS SOUND EVERY.::
Loved it bro. You just bring smile to my face no matter what
HunterxHunter playing casually in the background is such a vibe lol. Even in the chimera ant arc
Bro drying his hands everywhere
I felt like he just slapped my face
Dino lose all his calories in one go of a yt short
I was about to say.. No matter where you come from, the house is hers Lmaoo!!
If he just said ""nah, I ain't got it"" would be better
Bro did the classic ""This whole house is her gift."" Let's hope his wife don't see this.
When you realised that he has a whole manson apart from his gaming home for his wife
Bro forgot his child
0:23 cute dogy
Let’s not forget the dog is priceless
I think she is the owner bro's the pet
This video made me understand the actual meaning of vine booms
Dude has dadas money, I bet his dad is not even proud of him
MTV's Welcome To My Crib YT Shorts Edition.
""Honey, is our neighbour practicing swimming again?""
""Yea.. in the air""
Rich Kids don't know how to appreciate those Dino...
Actually You are the Billions dollars Gift for her....
Your Love and Care is more Expensive than Those Appliances...

Bro instantly picked the dishwasher
The smack is easily the best part of this video
Bro has beer
Dog lookin out the window: ""He's doing weird sh*t for internet strangers again""
at this stage he is unbeatable... u can't defeat him
Bro was gesticulating with all his might
Bro really the biggest gift he gave his wife is himself. I mean she literally married a living legend
I Love his humour
The best part is the hunterxhunter playing on tv
Those are not gifts. Most of them are household items
I have a quaistion what you do for living.
Not gonna lie, bro's gotta whole lot of whiskey collection. Love it
Dog: tf's happening bro
Except for bro's gadgets and toys, the whole house is actually for his wife. That's the mark of a true gentleman.
The baby as a gift
I say the same things to my wife, everything apart from the mattresses, pillow and my PC tables are all brought for you. I just need these three
Bro give us house tour
Dino doing sorcery with those hand movements
Dino had a lot of gift for his wife even the sound can not follow him

You had me when you started with the Kitchen
I want to look at the kitchen longer so I watched it all over again and again and again....
Ngl thats a pretty nice house you got there
Bro is so pissed he starts performing ""orchestra""
That's not a gift, that's your responsibility as a provider.
Garage is his. Everywhere else, he's a transient.
Dino gonna end up sleeping in his ev car again
His Vietnamese aura is over 9000!!!!
Solid shots fired right there

Best combo ever
I thought bro was stretching. Turns out he was trying to show his house
lol that dog was like ""tf dino doing again""
Bro don't forget the baby too.
New dancebro discover new dance
What was bro thinking when he asked him that?!
The dog side eying him through the glass door got me
Tbh need dino home tour like 1 hour video
The dog trying not to videobomb him
Ok. You've exercised enough for today.
Bro hit with that ultimate combo
Even sneaker collection belongs to wife
That dog showed up like ""Liar""
mayaman na mayaman ka na lodi samantala yun iba kaht gameboy di makabilo
He proved him wrong and then kept on going adding salt to the wound
HxH is peakk
Part of me thought he was going to present their child as an expense
Nahh, those shoes alone worth more than everything he have.
The house is in her name, bruh. That was his gift.
That kitchen was personal
Morel in the background big W’s
That kitchen bigger than my house
My bro worth unlimited money why she need 10k$

Dude really just said “where do you think we are?”
Kuya dino didn't even had to include him and their child since they are priceless, top fan already lost the moment he got noticed
He flexed ""THEIR""HOUSE! He literally lives there! And that was before $10k pc hahahahah!!!
The most silent valid crash out I've seen
No words needed
Only the garage is for Dino
Bro is the goat
That guy still thinks Dino is the master of the house
Them gestures
You are the best , after a hard day of work I can smile a lot
That kitchen ware itself and the kitchen set already pass 10.000
Not to mention the shoe and content of the wardrobe.
Wow his muscles are gonna hurt from this dance routine
I can agree the kitchen alone worth more than pc
bro really said ""get yo job application""
bro has 100% in every perks
bruv suddenly knows sign language
I really thought he's gonna show the kid.
damn you bro for questioning brow, we all got cooked there.
Jabbawockeez taught him those moves.
Lol, too funny. It is so true, on point sir.

Dropping the comment for the giveaway for the $2k stealthy PC!
Hi! This is a long shot I’m willing to take. My cyber power crapped out on me two weekends ago. I am a 23 yr old mom, married, living with my parents because everything is so expensive. I work a full time job from home while also caring for my daughter full time. I got into PC gaming in 2022 and ever since then, especially now, it’s my relaxation on the weekends. I get me time, where I’m not needed as mom, wife or daughter. I cannot afford to fix or buy a new one unfortunately as we have much more important things to tend to. My baby comes first of course. Thank you for reading and good luck to everyone 🫶

Then two 4K displays also byLogic. Nice and glossy. You mightremember it from my previous setupiteration. A vertical stand for MacBookwhich we have removed later just becauseit was better without it. BesidesWoolpad and classic elements 3, we gotRD75 keyboard by Pomier. And to behonest, I'm surprised how good pre-builtkeyboards have became now. Then someminimal looking speakers, a webcam forall his video call goals, and a sprinkleof personalization. I will try to listevery item in my bio. If you cannot findit, then just tag Daniel. I will makesure he will answer all of yourquestions. Obviously, I couldn't leavewithout managing a few cables. And guesswhat? Built-in tray is surprisinglygood. We were able to fit two powersupplies for monitors, one for the huband the hub itself. And you cannot seeany of it. And here is the final look.","Why shiny displays?

It's too big for the PC case,so we're going to water block it. We'regoing to be using a white Fantex waterblock to go ahead and take care of thisguy. If you've never taken apart a GPU,it only seems scary, but once you do ita few times, you get quite comfortable.Only a few screws with this MSI 4090,and we're right down to the PCB. Takingapart GPUs is definitely scary,especially if it's your only one. I knowhow it feels because you don't want tobreak your card, but it's a lot easierthan you think, and as long as you'recareful, you shouldn't have any issues.If you're doing any maintenance or waterblocking a GPU, you got to make sure toremove the original thermal base. Thisone's a lot more stout or thick than theother ones, and you can see it here.It's pretty dang hard to get rid of. Thegreat thing about not cheaping out on awater block is one, they're usually moreefficient, and they cover more of theGPU, but also all of the pads arepre-cut. So, this Fantex kit came inhandy. Everything was super easy, and itdidn't take very long. Now, it's time toadd the thermal paste to the GPU. And ifI'm ever doing any custom water cooling,I'm going to be doing this manually tomake sure every bit of that thing iscovered. If I'm not doing liquid metal,I'm definitely using a spatula to spreadthis thing out. Now that everything'sdone, we can sandwich the block with theactual PCB. I just line up the holesfrom behind and look underneath it justso I can make sure I'm not movinganything because you don't want the padsto move during this process becauseyou're going to have worse temps if theydon't move on top of the chips thatthey're supposed to be on. Now, wheneverdoing your loop, just make sure that youdon't power anything else on. You justwant power going to the pump because ifthere is a leak for whatever reason andyou did something wrong, you don't fryany of the components. But look howbeautiful this coolant looks. I knowthere's going to be extra maintenance,but I know that going in. But look atthese chilly temps we are","The cost it would have been of getting a bigger case than water blocking it
Yo that’s sick!! I’ve always wanted to take apart a gpu but I’m too scared of breaking my 7800xt
I sharted when i heard the gpu crack
im well aware that termal paste can be basically be just jizzed on rather careless and it will (given there is a sufficient amount of course) spread just fine as soon you mount it later (even tested it multiple time myself in various and the most daring ways) but it simply dosent feel right when there is still some shiny/metal part of the chip visible before you sent it so i 100% felt that goop spread there <3
Bro got me all motivated to go water blocks
do not remove ptm 7950 ,thats not thermal paste ,thats thermal phase changin material ,it will settle itself in the new block and is 3 times better than anything but liquid metal
I've taken apart probably over 100 at this point and the fan connectors still scare me. That coolant is awesome!
0:30 thats insane how close you came to taking out that entire row of transistors and ruining the card lol.
Yeah rather choose that aircooler, at least its using that X-Bracket. Its there for a good reason.
To be honest this should be standard these days, considering the sick prices.
Great! Now it'll fit my dell sff
Absolutely beautiful
If videocards get any bigger they are going to be their own motherboard soon.
They make little air pumps specifically for pressure testing custom loops
you drop a single screw onto carpet
Use 99% isopropyl alcohol over 91%

A lot less water content for fast drying when working with electronics
Taking apart a Gpu seems a lot like taking apart a laptop
Pretty sure you want to reuse that bracket on the back of the gpu that spreads the load evenly over the chip.
I mean it's kinda bizarre how every other component that makes a PC either stayed around the same size or actually got significantly smaller over the years but the GPUs just literally turned into Hulks sizewise and they keep growing every year.

Like if this trend continues in about 10y PCs gonna be essentially 90% just graphic cards and you gonna need dedicated GPU power supplies.
being careful unfortunately isn't enough, my 5700xt apparently was on the verge of failure, and a reassembly sent it over the edge
Wow, that looks nice. I need to do this. Do you have any longer instructional videos?
That's the temp I get on my 4060 when idling (it has one fan)
i have a fraqtal pop xl. case says it has room in the front for a 420mm rad, it does not. so i took some tools to it and now it does. 
 
looks kinda like an early 2000's ricer, but im at a flat 40c in an 80 degree garage in florida.

get an angle grinder and a sawzall. then you never have to worry of your case has space.
impractical but i understand . i like mini itx format but powerful big gpus make mini itx unpractical . if you compromise the size you have to go for medium tier in gpus so i would prefer visuals on the screen instead of the case . all this appart of using less active cooling and less noise . so in the long term your hardware gonna last longer . mechanic fail of the soldering is a real thing when you operate with constant temperature changes . contraction and retraction make cracks and false contactacts everywhere . this is part of why power phases are pushed down with the heatsinks
Removing the thermal paste Removing a capacitor
Thats so cool.
Poor gamer here, my 3060ti when its fully loaded setting hotspot at around 100'C and ""gpu temp"" is 82'C. I know it need maintance but ive never did it on any gpu, and where i live it costs 100$. now im stuck on indie games, saving money to take care of it.
GPU thermal Paste are really hectic to clean off, especially on Nvidia
What is that thing displaying the temperature? So cool
I am pretty happy with the 32c I get off this one... Stalk and its not a new card its over 12 years old R9's last a long time
Once upon a time I watercooled crossfire HD 6990, then got the very bright idea to mount the cooling cables to my home radiator... Cheap heating. Ended up gonking the waterblock and a complete system failure due to too much water pressure that shorted everything out. Luckily I was able to save all of 800TB of the data.
Wow quite a beauty wafer right there!
“chilly temps” referring to the gpu, shows cpu temps
Extra maintenance? I thought less maintenance
I damn want water cooling so bad but the risk of getting it wrong at some point scares me out of it
Is their a noticeable difference in performance compared to stock fans honestly?
i need this 4 my 9070 XT when the fans go 100% you thing a ariplain is starting xD
I found out that most Cards run okay at 65ºc and having OC with w/cooled at 54ºc will not give you better performance for that Struggle of maintenance and expensive gears to make it work..
The GPU doesnt fit the case so we are gonna spend three times as much to water block it instead of buying a new case.
Risk $2000 graphics card or buy $100 case HMMMMMMMM I WONDER WHAT IS A BETTER OPTION
What is the maintenance you have to do, and how frequent?
Even with the water block it’s still 84.2 degrees that’s crazy
When i finally get my 6500xt upgraded im going to take that piece of junk apart just to get the practice and it will be the best thing it's ever contributed to my PC experience. Dont buy graphics cards before researching.
Nice I took my GTX 750 TI out of my vintage gaming computer because it was getting insanely hot and still had its warranty stickers intact right on the screws put the new paste on went to screw it all back together and one of the screws has completely cross threaded and just spins perfect

I'm a mechanic my whole life is taking apart expensive things and remembering how to put it back together
Yea guys use caution but don't be scared
Do you even understand that your GPU is running less efficient at that temperature? It's like cooling your car motor down to cold start...
Those things are built to run on a set temperature. Most gpus run best on 60-80°C

For water-cooling to be better than fans, you need to regulate/heat the water to 60-70°C depending on the power of your GPU and thermoresistance between your components.

But since it's only for show like apple vision pro it's ok, but don't pretend to know what you're doing or that it's necessary.
And still a 3 slot gpu. Why it don't come with a single slot gpu bracket
That cpu temp is on idle? Or gaming temp?
does all 4090 are compatible with that water block?
It’s not that it’s ticker or anything. It’s drying out
we water blocked the gpu, look at the temp of the cpu... buhee
Is there glitter in the water
AIO is the way to go, not chunky fans
I wish i had the damm money for a pc a good one damm
ok sometimes watercooling looks good but no way i do water cooling for my self too much risk and too expenssive for no reason no use for gaming .. .
Thats the CPU temp
Buy, bigger case




Nah just water block it
Why brands don't make AIO for GPU??
Can anyone share the actual name of the thermal pad kit he's using? I can't seem to find it.
Why not use ptm7950? It has better performance than paste and is basically immortal to pump out???
would you say its worth it repasting my 3060ti or getting a 5060 ti 16gb (im playing in 1440p where my 3060ti struggles)
First you said taking apart a GPU only seems scary until you get used to it. You then immediately said taking apart a GPU is definitely scary. I'm sore confiors
Is that temp display on mobo?
you removed the best thermal salution that gpu could have PTM7950
Those pads are backwards right? The textured side should face the GPU I thought.
use a leak tester! why doesnt anyone use a leak tester or recommended using a leak tester?
What about kryo sheets mine are by thermal Grizzly
cpu temp?
29° on the 4090 is BS!

Im kinda new in pc building but isnt phanteks like considered silent?
Your temps are the same as my 3090 TI with a lot more Wattage and no water cooling lol. All you have to do is undervolt it to .875 max, no reason to use water cooling anymore it's literally dead. My 3090 ti pulls about 300 watts instead of 450-500 while gaming, i have about 5-10fps difference on competitive unlocked fps games which i do not play anyway, and i always lock my frames to 120 because my monitor is 120hz. Idle temps on the gpu are around 25-28c browsing etc. Gaming is about 45-50c. ALL this on a nzxt h6 flow case 9 fans total + 3 from gpu. Top fans are the radiator from cpu.

But i cant deny water cooling looks nice, though overpriced and messy to deal with.
W
I wish you sent me a GPU
Water blocking is scary and disgusting
I've been water blocking my GPU starting with my 1080ti . Custom loop is the only way. Those AI coolers for lazy people.
Can you give me one 4060 for free ...
I live in India
Can I get a pc?
No ptm 7950? Cmon man
chicken
Im getter the same or better temps using fans. This is purely for looks.
Spend 70$ pn bigger case? I sleep
Spend 200$ on a waterblock and run the risk of flooding your pc? Real sheet
Regular thermal paste with water block man wtf, where’s your phase thermal paste
yeah dont scratch at the processor lol... Its fine its thermal paste. You dont need to get it off every nook and cranny.
Created a unsellable card nobody will pay even half of what you put into it once you decide to upgrade
""Look how beautiful that coolant looks"" *proceeds to show angle of PC where you can barely tell what coolant looks like*..... Yeaaa very nice so beautiful
Never open your gpu.
really don't need to spread the paste. 5 dots is all you need
lol. Thermal paste on gpu???????? I hope at least it is Phase-change thermalpaste
Damn stop buy custom designs when you literally throw away the cooler. Just buy a founders edition damn
Wrong you don't want bubbles.
Are you intentionally not installing the spring back?
That spread was HORRIBLE
dude its called Msi rtx 4090 trio respect the card and ofc its a big card TRIO tripple lame ass
DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GUY
You made it ugly you murder the badboi
too much paste, dude. Way too much
can you please donate me a GPU

Let's jump into the video.Hello guys, welcome back to my channel Unbox and \nBeyond and my name is Srini. This channel is allabout the first impression and overview of the \nproduct. So I have recently purchased a sit andstand desk from IKEA. So this particular table is \nspecially targeted to the people who are mostlyinto gaming. However, as it is a sit and stand \ndesk and very good for ergonomic. So that's thereason I have bought this table and I have bought \nthis table for my work purpose and also this tablecan be shared between my family members. So the \nheight of the table can be adjusted from 72 cm to120 cm and the tabletop size is 140 cm. However, \nthis also can be extended to 180 cm. So friends,overall this particular desk for the price of \n€300 is worth it and it can handle a maximumload of 70 kilos. Well, I have just purchased \na desk and I I just did the setup. I hope youlike the video. So without further do, let's \nget into the unboxing setup and the review.First, let's see what's inside the box.The gaming desk comes in two different \nsections, tabletop and underframe. Theunderframe has two boxes. Box one, instruction \nmanual, motorized legs, plus electronic parts.In box two, you have legs \nand some supporting frame.You can see all the parts in this short clip.Now before you start the setup or the assembly \nI would highly recommend to go through theinstruction manual couple of times. Now follow \nthe guide as per the instruction manual step bystep. And the first and important thing is to \nbuild the underframe as per the instruction.Rememberyour tabletop size is 140 or 180 cm and you \nhave to adjust the under frame accordingly.Once the frame is ready, it is now time \nfor fixing the electrical units. It isstraightforward. Just follow the manual \nand give the connection accordinglybefore attaching the underframe with the tabletop. \nBetter to test it. Here you go. I am now checkingthe up and down movement for my desk. And once I'm \nsatisfied, now it is time to open the tabletop.The tabletop which I got is of 140 cm \nand it comes with a solid black color.The build quality is good and \nalso it looks heavy. and sturdy.The tabletop comes with predefined holes and \nit is easy to connect to the underframe. So,simply fix the screw and you are ready.It took me almost 3 hours to assemble the desk and \nthat's because I was using a normal screwdriver.If you have a power screwdriver, \nthe assembly is even faster.The entire underframe is made up of metal \nwhich makes it strong and sturdy. And thelook and feel also matches the gaming vibe. I \nespecially like the color black. And now yourhigh performance gaming desk is ready for high \nperformance gaming. Remember to customize theheight presets. Refer the instruction manual for \nspecific instructions. And if you encounter anyissues with the height adjustment, refer to \nthe manual or contact IKEA customer service.Well, from my point of view, uh I feel in \nthe price of €300, this particular sit andstand table is worth it. The reason because it \ncomes with a strong and sturdy underframe. Thetabletop is also quite heavy and also which I \nlike it has a uh set of presettings where youcan store the settings of different heights. \nIt comes with a USB-A charging point. You canconnect any devices for charging and you don't \nneed to run around for USB ports. So friends,that's all in this video and I hope you like the \nvideo and also this video help you to make somedecision. I have also done uh setup and review \nof couple of other sit and stand desk. I'll sharethe link in the description below. So that's all \nin this video. Do let me know in comment sectionif you're using this particular desk and what \nare your thoughts. And also make sure to like,share and subscribe my channel and \nI will see you in the next video.","Durable, stylish, and ergonomic gaming desk the IKEA UPPSPEL is absolutely worth it!
Does this table wobble when you work on it?
€300 is expensive

 2. Melt the butter in a sauce pan or microwave-safe bowl. 
 3.stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Mix well. 
 4. Add the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. 
Stir until fully combined.

Maybe swap around the ram sticks
Looks fine to me
i wonder why won't turning on
Try turning off the power supply and pur water on it. And also you should destroy the components that helps a lot
Have you tried reseating the ram
Maybe its thirsty, pour some water on it
Now imagine if it just turned on, how would you react to that?
Respect the NZXT HFlow case
have you tried turning it on and off?
Check the psu the behind case must have a 1
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
Delete system 32 that should do the trick
The psu is not in the case
The power button isn't in the box
Bro really said f the pc lets make brownies
Have you tried plugging it in
Nah, you need to clean the Ram
What are the specs?
tHAT CANT BE FIXED GIVE IT TO ME
Doesn’t look like you’re missing anything
Did you plug it in
I don’t think that’s how you make a PC bro. Lol
You need to use a rysan cpu
its broken give it to me

""Law of equivalent exchange.""... 
Me over here looking for the Philosopher's Stone.
""bro you're ducked""
Lmao, im not gonna lie, my wife personally has 2 Michael Kors bags that I specifically bought because of Dino, and my friend is now on the same wave. You're the man Dino changing the game!
I took Dino's teachings into practice and it really works, I went shopping with my wife and gave her €200,- to buy a nice outfit and then took her out for diner and paid for everything including our nanny who watched our kid at home, then the next day I casually mentioned I bought the PSVR2 and now after 2 weeks, still no complains or reactions about my purchase She's just exited for me.
Watched and learned too many Full Metal Alchemist episodes
I watched enough FMA to know how screwed you are when the exchange is not equal. Bro is losing an arm
“Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.”
That’s how he knew, he fcked up
That Labubu for food was straight up more diabolical than everything else because that's how bro's gonna get fed moving forward
He's the guy who puts everyone into trouble
""Law of equivalent exchange"" my left foot this transmutaion has backfired on Mr. Irving
Bro boutta wip out a philosopher stone to ignore the law
""law of equivalent exchange""...bro's gonna lose an arm and a leg
That cool but can u teach us single

Bubu salary: 50k
Dudu salary: 70k

Household income: 70k
Bubu household budget: 70k

Law of equivalent exchange

Dudu ask to buy item-A
Taken from 70k but also has to give Bubu something worth of item-A also taken from what was taken from that 70k
Bro be talking Fullmetal
Bro raised the bar for her to the point where it's unreachable for him. Goated
Movies directors need to ask for your advice. You are too good.
""I teach married men ."" Aight imma head out
""Law of Equivalent Exchange"" We will not forget that boss
""Law of equivalent exchange"" like in Fullmetal alchemist
Bro saying the real thing in the end
Not sure what part of this is equal but yeah, your not wrong. Also, a room tour would be nice since you have added a lot to your setup since the last one.
The best law ever man
Versace for ER Nightreign? Bro is cooked
Dude, you can directly buy it from Chinese factories, same factory supplies to the boutiques where u bought them...
Lmao. Dino gonna make husbands go broke
Dino, the Wife Whisper
Bro you're cooked was pure gold
Bro you're f*** got me
I can hear mr. Erving cursing
Dino really summoned a meteor on the poor guys home lol
Such a good vibe...
Law of equivalent exchange my bro started teaching chemistry
""I thought... I thought we were friends ""
“Law of equivalent exchange” aka Law of negotiating desire.
From the get i had a feeling he was gonna take that route
Now he Gave human blood taste to the tiger.
Bro is cooking. 
Love from India 🇮🇳
My husband follows you. Whenever he got some techy thing that I let him sleep for weeks before he purchase, he would get me smtg twice the cost.

 Thank you for educating our husbands.
He's trying to sabotage marriages
LOL! Law of Equivalent Exchange = Unfair.

I love the part of in exchange of nuggets for a bag
Ohh shit... Erving dude say goodbye to your money now.
Dino did you bad here my friend.
Labubus for Chicken Nugget Meal I can’t
I love your reference to FMA
40$ nightreign vs 10k$ channel law of equivalent exchange
Show us your car collection. Real cars not toys. We got him guys
The ending!
Dino put crazy pressure on that guy
Thank you bro. You are a good man indeed
I love your vibes, I just followed you. Im not certain, but you give of filipinovibes. I work w a filipino dude, and you remind me of him. BTW, as a woman, that purse is a flex!
As a husband, i could say dino words are absolutely accurate
You never know. You might be helping the husband too...
Yep! For every game or electronics.. I buy myself something or a weekend trip on him.
Poor Mr. Erving
Married men: Now we are cooked.
He's really funny
Ah no f no , no no 
Wife must not watch this ....
Wtf, now the missus' bags are your trophies too?!
Bro didn’t name the law for McDonald’s. That wasn’t equivalent af
mrs erving got new lesson about equality
Too late, that fan has his wife's family name as his last name.
I made sure my wife's YouTube algorithm never finds this man.
There's balance in the universe whenever Dino steps up
Jokes aside... It's always been like this, people just don't dare to put it this way because it doesn't sound endearing. But we all know phases in relationship isn't always lovey-dovey. You learn to be affertionate and heartful with any actions, no matter how unlikely it is to be felt as romantic gesture in generic context.
Best save ever
Love FMA
Oh no. Now Mr. Irving""s wants becomes expensive
The math is mathing!
Dino highering standards for wives everywhere I love it
You don't need equivalent exchange if you are forever alone
Just remember this , when they ask for something is cost 10x what yours will cost .
you were the chosen one!!!!! it was said that you would destroy the wives, not join them!!! you were to bring balance to the dudes, not leave us in the darkness….
Made in China bags, zipper sewn on in Italy, or wherever, and they say ""Made in Italy"". They also make huge profits this way. I couldn't believe it when I heard about it, but they do the same thing with meat. ""Product of USA"" labeled on your steak, but it is actually from some other country.
This man the biggest opp
The homie Dino man
Of course this is about Philosopher's Stone, it will explain his sum of cash, formed from rearranging steel rust atoms into gold.
How it’s done or two of everything, one for you one for her!
Law of Equivalent Exchange - 
Elden Ring Cost - $40 = Louis Vuitton Cost - $1,200
so you need $1,240 to buy an Elden Ring Nightreign
Mr, Erwin Good Luck.. LoL
Dino's law
There is nothing equivalent about those exchanges
Bro was humble. Bro is now just evil
full metal alchemists law of equivalent exchange
I love you videos you just make my day feel good and you are the best person to ever exist just saying it not to be get something from you but it's really cool I just like your videos
Ahh nostalgia feel as he said ""law of equivalent extange"" full metal Alchemist
The ""F""! How is that equal???
This is true. Because of Dino I was able to buy new monitor bought my wife a new bag and a dress
you got a hot fudge sundae??? I need to rethink my priority bro...
Brother thinks we have enough money to buy two expensive items instead of just one
Dino, my wife approved your messages!
Now I'm having Switch 2!! Part 2 is needed
I'll never let my wife see this.
You make Mr Ervings insecure
lol I’m glad my wife ain’t into purses. She ain’t even into jewelry, she only wears the ones I’ve bought her. I got a keeper
Versace bag isn’t the cost of nightreign
Mr. Erving.... run...
GOOD LUCK BRAAH ERVING :))
Your wife would never know about a digital purchase
bro i bought myself a motorcycle and bought my wife small car. She isnt complaining at all

It looks like he declined the challenge🫡

Sedetta. Don't know how tosay it, but it's an L-shaped gamingdesk. It's 62 inches, but it's L-shaped,but you can make it one long desk tomake it 87 in. It has cabinets anddrawers and pegboards. But instead of mejust talking about it, let's put ittogether so you can see what I'm talkingabout. I got a timer here. See how longthis takes. I've built desks before andit's taken me hours. So, I'm not lookingforward to this, honestly. So, let'sjust get this started. What? Or not? Youbeeping on me. Is that the right Oh,there you go. And timer started. Allright. Let's Let's get started.I need space.[Music]This is going to take me a while.[Music]It's been5 minutes.Let's break. Uh there's differentoptions. Four options. Lesk. Let's justdo option one. And then what? You knowwhat? I don't have enough memory onthese memory cards. About to find out.Step one. How many steps are in thisthing? It's a lot of pages. Oh jeez.This thing is 40 pages. All right. Or 40steps.Three and four. All right. Oh, JesusChristover here just for now cuz I think I'mbuilding the frame first.[Music]Oh, cool. this outlet thing. That'scool. It's got four uh four outlets uphere and USB A, but that's fine. Yeah.See, some of these steps are reallyquick stuff. I was just putting twoscrews in.[Music][Music]Let's get this on the ground before Iscratch this up.All right, soC camera 2 was down, so resounding thisone now. It's fine. And we're aboutover an hour in now.All right, we are on step. What step isthis? Step11.All right, where are we at, though? Hey,before I start, I lost my tool. No,turn you around.It's actually pretty late.Actually,[Music]I'm pretty sure you're set, right? So, Ijust put you Oh my god, you're heavy.[Music]Let'sheavier this way. Jeez, I forgot you'reheavy.Heavy.I'm right.That's it. I think we're done. Otherthan the wall mounts, but I can't reallywall mount this right now cuz not thisis not where I'm leave everything at.111 minutes plus 21. It's 130 132minutes. That's over 2 hours. 2 hoursand12 minutes. 2 hours 12 minutes. Allright, that camera 2 is back. And wherewe at here? I took way too long. 2 hoursand 12 minutes to put this thingtogether. But it's done.All right, I'm going to take a break.Then we'll go over all the features ofthis desk. I'm so tired.Oh man.So yeah, here's the L-shaped desk fromSedetta. Now, this is just one of fourconfigurations for this desk. You canhave it set up the way that I do here,or you can have the hutch on the otherend of this desk, or you can make itjust one long desk with the hutch onceagain on either side. The desk is madeof P2 particle board, which is durableand anti-cratch, which I scientificallytested earlier. Three and four. Allright. Oh, Jesus Christ. It uses a thickmetal frame to keep everything togetherand secure. It has adjustable feet padsto keep the desk stable on uneven floor,and they also help to protect the floorfrom scratches. So, this has fivedrawers on the side. From the pictures,I thought they were going to be moresolid wood or metal drawers, but they'refabric drawers. Not a big deal, butsomething to know so you don't get yourhopes up like I did. They're pretty bigdrawers, though, which will help youkeep your desktop organized and free ofclutter. Let's not talk about how mycurrent desk setup looks like right now.There's a display cabinet over here thathas pop out glass doors. I don't thinkit's actually glass, but either way,it's see-through, so you can seeeverything that's in there. And there'sthe LED light strip along the top here.here to nicely light up whatever youhave in here. There's an app that youcan use so that you can control thelights, or you can just use the controlthat's wired into the lights. You willhave more control of the lights ifyou're using the app, though. The lightshave a mic built in, so you can have thelight color change in rhythm with soundor music. Does this light up the soundof my voice? Oh, it's it's changing atthe sound of my voice. That's kind ofcool. Or you can just use the timerfunction to create an enjoyableatmosphere. There's a pegboard alonghere, so you can hang things likeheadphones or controllers.It only comes with five hooks, though,so you'll have to pick some up if youneed more. Along the side where thedrawers are are two iron hooks, so youcan hang a bag or whatever over here.Built into the tabletop of the desk is apower strip with four outlets and twoUSBA ports so you can easily power upyour printer, phone, computer, anythingyou need to power on up here. So, mythoughts on this desk. For the price ofjust over $200, it's a good option. Thedesk isn't as deep as I would prefer. Imight be too used to my editing desk,but I like to have a lot of space on mydesk. This is probably good for peoplewho don't have a lot of space in theirwork area, though. The drawers beingfabric. I know I said it's not a bigissue, but it uses plyboard to keepeverything together, so you're not goingto want to put heavy items in there. Thepower strip is nice, but it's in thecorner, or if you have the desk set uplike I do, it's on the far end of thedesk. I'm not sure how to improve onthis, though, since the placement can begood or bad for you depending on whichdesk configuration you go with. But theway I have this set up right now, it'snot really ideal. The display case doorsdon't really sit even. It doesn't botherme until I turn the lights on in thecabinet, and you can see the uneven gapsin the doors. This triggers my OCD alittle bit. And finally, those lightsare just a light strip that you stickonto the top of the cabinet. I've onlyhad this desk for a little bit, and thelights already started coming off on theside. I do have those clips that I canmount there that would help, I guess,but it still just feels a little cheap.But yeah, once again, for the price,it's a good option. I have the blackcolor here obviously, but you can alsoget it in rustic brown or white as well.I'll have everything linked in thedescription if you're interested in thisdesk. All right, I need to go clean upmy editing desk. I didn't realize howmessy it was until right now.See you.[Music]","40 Steps omg and the part where you almost fell
great review!!! i just bought this and currently have it staring at me in the living room waiting to get put together but this gave me a great idea on what to fully expect once it’s done + assembly time!

carter watchu doing on your computer that you need to use a pedal to close a tab that fast
He didn't even set one to close tabs. Just chrome, password and fucking doordash.

Needing one for doordash is just crazy
If you don’t Acknowledge us Carter by August 1st we will riot
Why do you need to close google chrome so fast when you have a gf
No I don’t need a foot pedal for my setup actually
NOTICE US. NOTICE YOUR YOUTUBE AUDIENCE. WE EXIST. OR ELSE, YOU WILL BE FORCED TO DO THE THUG SHAKE.
Opera GX can also change your tabs. When you press F12, it will close all the tabs, and switch to a cover tab (some are default, like wiki) and you can also add some of your own. If you press F12 again, u will return to the previously open tabs
Bro the foot pedal for DoorDash is the gluttony the Bible talked about
lol, bro forgot about ALT+F4 and Ctrl C+Ctrl V
Introducing... The foot pedal! The most inconvenient thing you could buy
lowk a foot pedal would go hard, can you get racing pedals to also do this? a clutch pedal to open a game? would be awesome
Nah, I tap my foot a lot while sitting there, I would definitely accidentally hit it
These are made for the osrs gamers so they we can relax our wrists sometimes while xp grinding.
Ok, but why does Carter need to close tabs??? whatcha got in there Carter??
The sky zone socks are wild lol
Why did I just see warzone players who all had foot deals so I commented asking what they were for since my controller has enough buttons on the short right before this. I knew it used everything for my feed but that quick? I mean I clicked post then scrolled. How?
I’m on trackpad and I have set it to make a three finger tap (custom gesture) do the alt + tab. It is instant

Carter? Anyways heres how scruedrivers are made

Screwdrivers are manufactured through a combination of metalworking, forging, machining, and assembly processes. Here’s a breakdown of the typical steps involved in producing a standard screwdriver:

⸻

 1. Raw Materials
 • Blade/Shaft: Usually made from high-carbon steel, chrome-vanadium steel, or tool steel for strength and durability.
 • Handle: Made from plastic (polypropylene or acetate), rubber, or sometimes wood.

⸻

 2. Forging the Shaft/Blade
 • A steel rod is cut to length.
 • It’s heated in a furnace and hot-forged (pressed into shape) to form the screwdriver shaft and tip.
 • The shape of the tip (flathead, Phillips, etc.) is partially formed at this stage.

⸻

️ 3. Machining and Shaping
 • CNC machines (or similar tools) further refine the blade, especially the tip:
 • Phillips heads are milled to form the cross pattern.
 • Flathead tips are ground to a sharp edge.
 • The shaft may be knurled (textured) or grooved for grip or fitting.

⸻

 4. Heat Treatment
 • The metal is hardened and tempered through heat treatment to improve strength and wear resistance.
 • This involves heating to a high temperature, then cooling rapidly (quenching), followed by reheating to reduce brittleness.

⸻

 5. Magnetizing (Optional)
 • Some screwdriver tips are magnetized using an electromagnetic coil to help hold screws in place during use.

⸻

️ 6. Coating and Finishing
 • Shafts are coated for corrosion resistance using:
 • Black oxide
 • Chrome plating
 • Nickel plating
 • Tips may be hardened further or coated with anti-slip material for grip.

⸻

 7. Molding the Handle
 • Plastic is injection molded around the end of the shaft.
 • For ergonomic designs, dual materials (hard plastic + soft rubber) are used.
 • In acetate screwdrivers, the plastic is often chemically bonded to the metal shaft.
 • Wooden handles are typically pressed on and pinned or glued.

⸻

 8. Assembly and Quality Control
 • Handle and shaft are assembled (if not molded as one piece).
 • Each screwdriver is inspected for:
 • Proper fit and shape of the tip
 • Hardness and straightness of the shaft
 • Handle attachment and comfort

⸻

 9. Packaging and Shipping
 • The screwdrivers are labeled, packaged (individually or in sets), and shipped to distributors or retailers.

Bru what if sm is trying to get into ur computer and they just hit the button for the password?
Just alt+tab and you‘re good to go.
alt + f4
or
alt + tab and use the middle click to close a window
Bro is the ultimate glutton having a whole ass pedal just for doordash
Day 19 of asking carter to apologize to the GTA community for mistaking GTA 4 with GTA 5
The point of a password is to avoid people logging into your account. Tf that foot pedal supposed to do??
Why tf is one of the monitors overlapping the other
Alt+F4, Ctrl + W, F12 on Opera GX, Ctrl + N, Ctrl + Shift+ N, the list goes on
When you accidentally kick the foot pedal away from its original position and then forget it was moved at night:

Footsteps approaching door foot moves towards where the pedal was supposed to be originally foot stomping on rug frantically while moaning continues coming through the screen where's that pedal? WHERE'S THE PEDAL door opening along with sound of belt buckle tinking AHHH
This helps..
ACKNOWLEDGE US NOW CARTER
For people who are experienced with alt tab and hand position auto fits it when not typing, it’s lightning fast
if you got a certain tab open and you gotta close it but whoever comes in is gonna ask what you closed do ctrl + w, ctrl + t and then ctrl + w again and when they ask hit ctrl + shift + t. close tab, open new one, close again, open last tab.
Just realized i wasnt subscribed and i have been watching you for a long long time
Get an elgato Stream Deck
Get foot pedal

Skyzone socks are getting out of hand man.
never heard of Windows+D?
Why is bro wearing skyzone socks
opera gx got my back f12
Having a button for your password is peak social engineering bait
I like how a foot pedal is just two pieces of metal making contact and Carter is like there were so many off brand foot pedals back in the day
I use Arch Linux with Hyprland, I can just super key + shift + q
Why you gotta close google so fast Carter?
”Please like comment and subscribe my power bill is going through the roof and I can’t stop buying random gadgets that I don’t know what I’m going to use it for” now I see why you did that to automatically put in your password…
Keyboard macros also exist
Nice

Petition to get carters attention on us yt shorts viewers
That pedal sounds like it is useful for racing games
lets all spam carter saying : react to your yt comments
#carterreadytcomments
Maybe that foot pedal will let you crank 90s faster
You need a PC for my studies: cyber security and the gaming aspect is an very nice extra. Looking to play like cyber punk and those kind of AAA games so I will actually use the PC at his fullest. Not like people who just wanna play fortbite at 1000 fps

Yes I just copied this from the other vid comment am lazy:]
If you think your lazy, then just think about this guy.
Foot Pedals should be used for racing games like Nr2003
What is bro trying to close so fast that he needs a FRIGGIN PEDAL FOR?!?!
Im get one i aint never getting caught
You should set one for “delete search history”
thats the thing LTG uses to hide his screen when he's ragequitting from games lmao
Big back is so big you need a damn foot pedal for door dash
Alt-Tab-Ctrl-Delete is definitely too slow when mom walks in
Carter hasn't been hit with that ol alt-f4
nah you need to make a python program that maps an app locker to a hotkey
ctrl+w closes your current tab in browsers and also all of windows btw
When you can’t afford pedals on your sim racing setup:
LINE UP YOUR MONITERSS
Swipe down with three fingers to minimize a window.
I just have task manager pinned on my taskbar, and I didn't even have to spend a dollar
the doordash is biblical levels of gluttony
That was a genuine cry for help in those notes damn
A couple of the Minecraft YouTubers I watch use footpedaks for Minecraft cause one of them actually drums so thought it was smart
PUT THE OUTRO BACK
who really needs a foot pedal
""Alt + F4"": Hold my beer
IF HE DOESNT NOTICE YOUTUBE WE STRIKE 🫡🫡🫡
If you need to close or hide the window just use Windows key + D, OR Ctrl + Shift + W
You can use win + d to minimize everything and show the desktop
Build a sim setup and use it as pedals
ctrl +w
The goon pedal bro
90$ for a cheap feeling peice of plastic with a 5$ controller board attached to it is insane

About 4–5 months later, my brother Ezra launched UnlimitedStories after seeing how much fun I was having (and maybe trying to one-up me). Now we write everything together, help edit each other’s videos, and share the same storytelling brain even if we keep our channels separate.\n\nWe've been big on writing (also big anime fan) since we were both in high school and as cliche as it sounds, it didn't stop there. Our stories are originally made and only sometimes a small idea taken from other internet stories.\n\nThe background is completely mine, I worked with someone to increase the quality of the background and get the best for my viewers :D\n\nGame: Trackmania\n","My friend used my gaming setup to scamkids while I was at work. Last summer,my roommate Josh asked if he could usemy gaming PC while I was at work. Hislaptop was trash and he wanted to streamFortnite. I figured, why not? We've beenfriends since freshman year and my setupwas just sitting there unused during my9 to5. For about a month, everythingseemed fine. He'd stream a few hourseach afternoon, maybe get 20 to 30viewers. Nothing crazy. He even offeredto pay part of the internet bill sincehe was using more bandwidth. Then Istarted getting weird Discord messages.Random kids asking when I'd be streamingagain or thanking me for the coachingsession. I don't stream, never have. Iasked Josh about it. Oh yeah, sometimesviewers think I'm used since I'm usingyour setup. I correct them. Cool,whatever, not a big deal. But themessages kept coming. One kid sent me$15 on PayPal with a note for thebuilding techniques lesson. Anotherasked if I could review his gameplayfootage like I promised. I confrontedJosh again. This time he came clean,sort of. He'd been offering paidcoaching sessions, telling kids he was asemi-pro player. Since he was streamingfrom my setup in my room with myperipherals visible, people assumed hewas me. He never corrected them. It'snot a big deal, he said. I actually ampretty good at the game. These kids arelearning something. I watched one of hisVODs. He was absolute trash. Likestruggling in public lobbies bad, butthese 12-year-olds didn't know anybetter. They were paying $10 to $20 forpro coaching from someone who couldn'teven build properly. The worst part, hewas using my Epic account during thesesessions. My account with all my skinsand stats. Kids would see my season 3skins and assume he was an OG player whoknew everything. I changed all mypasswords and told him he couldn't usemy setup anymore. He threw a fit sayingI was ruining his side hustle and beingselfish with my PC. Bro, you'reliterally scamming children, I said.It's not scamming if they're happy withthe service, he argued. We're notfriends anymore. I still get occasionalmessages from kids asking aboutcoaching. I tell them the truth. Thatwasn't me. And they should be carefulabout paying strangers online for gaminglessons. Josh moved out a month later.Found out from mutual friends he's stilldoing the coaching thing, but now he hasto use his garbage laptop. Apparently,his stream quality is so bad that he'slost most of his clients. It's good.","God forbid a man gets that bag somehow
As a pro player who is 13 pro since 12 that was easy scamming for complete noobs
I can finally say I have found one that does not have 10 other versions to it
I would still keep Him as my friend. He would just have to get his own laptop.
Man I forgot how stupid all this stuff sounded-
why are you ruining my side hustle, its not like its Fraud. But it is NIMROD.
just make is own profile on your computer and change/set your password so there is no confusion

We got it for cheapbecause it had a broken fan. So, we'regoing to go ahead and custom water blockit. We've already taken off the heatsink and other parts, but now we have toclean it before we water block it. So,we're going to use some 91% isopropylalcohol, clean off the internals, andthen we can go ahead and throw on thewater block. I still remember the firstGPU that I took apart. It was myfriend's card and it was his only one. Iwas so nervous that I was going to breakit because I really couldn't afford itat the time to replace it. If you have aGPU that's running hot, thermal pads andthermal paste will be a lifesaver forit. It's not as hard as it seems and aslong as you're careful, you shouldn'thave any issues. You really don't needto get this crazy when it comes tocleaning the die. As long as the die isclean, you should be just fine. And I'monly doing it because I'm basically apain in the ass.

So,depending on how much you spent on thewater block, you can get pre-cut pads oryou're going to have to cut themyourself. You just match them up towhere they're supposed to go, and thenyou just have to cut them. Since thepads are double wrapped in plastic, Ifind the easiest way is to use a razorblade and a cardboard pad so you canactually cut through it. Usually eachwater block will have a diagram of wherethe pads are supposed to go, but thisone just has little cutouts so you caneasily tell where the pads are going.Then we rinse and repeat for the rest ofthe pads. Get some thermal paste on theGPU, and then we slap this bad boytogether. Personally, if I'm doing acustom loop, I'm going to go ahead andspread the thermal paste out just tomake sure that every little piece ofthat die is covered just to make surebecause I don't want to take this apartand drain the loop. And there you have acustom water block 3090 Ti.","A broken fan? A new fan is like $2-10
You forgot to make sure to use pads different thickness in different locations
I replaced my thermal paste last week and 2 days later started getting 100C temps on the cpu just 5 minutes into browsing. 
Turns out the alcohol made the paste a little too wet so half of the paste literally started leaking downwards till it only covered half the cpu. Decided to properly do everything super slowly and clean all the fans. Now I gots 50C while gaming. :)
I built my 1st custom loop with my 3090Ti a couple years back. Hard tubing length tolerances are surprisingly forgiving and I didn't use anything but straight fittings so there's a lot of bends. I did have to go through a lot of tubing with some mistake but tubing is cheap.
Pain in the ahh? Then I’m your brother
Dude how are you not popular yet, your content is genuinely cool and informative
Thermal pads look like gum sticks
Nice . Keep up the good work.
My man said water block like 45 times.
Good on you for mentioning the thermal paste application. Nobody wants to take all that apart again just for paste
Tip, squish thermal paste on the die with the cooler, then lift the cooler off the die to see where you are missing paste or if you or the cooler has squished it crooked. I’ve never had air pockets in any of the thousands of fixes I’ve done, and it saves a little on having to spread it out like you did. You get to see the paste actually spread and do its job, and if it doesn’t you know where to fix/apply more.
3090ti is prob going to last a pretty long time as far as keeping up with AAA titles
non conductive 5 dot method is always the good option imho , pre-spreading introduces more air pockets. a bit of spillage on the capacitors on the side won't damage them, but even with spillage it won't spread out that far.
The first GPU I ever took apart was a pair of new R7870s that I slapped EK water blocks on. Well one was new the other was a couple months old. xD
Anyone else want to see crossfire and sli come back?
(for anyone wondering it was about the same as the GTX 660)
91% woops.
Damnnn i remember when 14nm was the best crazy how far things are
I wpould recommend using PTM7950 for the GPU instead pf using normal thermal paste because it has a bit better thermal performance. Thouh its expensive it is really good for a project like this one.
that's a lot of thermal paste.. you are filling in voids to get a transfer of heat that is even. When you put a ton of paste on it actually lifts the heat sync off the surface. You get lower heat transfer. You also get a mess. 

all in all a good video though.. Didn't know you could order a block for a card that fits.
Best to wear nitrile gloves when handling the water block so your fingerprints don’t corrode and tarnish the surface.
Обычная MX термопаста от Arctic , Чувак ты серьезно ? На видеокартах нужно использовать только фазовый переход .
first gpu that i ever done this was a friends 2060 super, my headass was so sweaty at the end.
Hitting those tiny metals near the die can literally make it die if you damage them... This was based on my personal experience...
still got my 3090 EVGA
How much did you get it for
If u waterblock it how does the gpu know its still being cooled even tho it has no fans
Nice! 
Doesnt look hard in the slightest i always got scared about it
Quite funny I bought a bykski block for my sapphire Rx 7900 XTX nitro+ card and they gave me CPU instructions for it so I used thermal grizzly putty and thermal grizzly thermal paste on it and assembled it with no instructions and got good temps with it
What gpu block did you use?
My 3080 12GB needs this soo bad, but it would cost more than the GPU is even worth in resale value to get this done . EVGA really crapped the bed with their cooling solution for the 30 series. This thing absolutely roasts itself.
Can you do anything to repair the display ports on a GPU? Been having issues with my 3090.
the ~5th time i took apart a card it finally died. fortunately i doubt it was my fault, it was an aging and poorly made gpu. either way, rip my 5700 xt
use 50% isopropyl
so you got a good card with a broke fan and then you didnt fix it you made it so you will hate it when you have to change something in your system.
I never use anything like that at all to remove heat dope from the GPU or even CPU I just use some tissue and it comes right off even if its hard. But I guess some people just love using chemicals
Why not use thermal paste instead of pads?
how do you know how thicc thermal pad to use?
isnt the 4070 super better then this thing lol
How do u figure out the pad size for a gpu vram

If you are a 5090 sucker use putty and a graphene pad at least.

Foundthis pastel purple bench, and I justknew that it would be perfect. I getreally in my head when I'm decoratingcuz I start thinking about whether otherpeople are going to like what I've doneor not. I'm really just trying to findstuff that feels authentic to me.Nothing says authentic like this weirdlamp that I got when I was like 13 yearsold. The third thing I added was thiscat window hammock, which is really morefor me than them because they won't stopstepping on me when I'm working.Collected my first victim, and ofcourse, she hates it. She literallycannot believe I would have the audacityto think she would want to enjoy a plushseat at a window looking at a tree.Everyone keeps telling me I need art andtrinkets. And don't worry, that's whatwe're going to do in part three. I'mgoing to be hanging up some of myfavorite art, which looks just like mycats.

A warning to putting stuff near your window is that some items may fade overtime due to over exposure to the sun

So, make sure to like andfollow for","BRO BE GRATEFUL SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE THESE
i mean if you don’t need the old one anymore hit me up
Meanwhile me chilling with my monitor from 15 years ago:
finally bro brings up the moniter from the stream 5 months ago
""need"" is a strong word
Bro Steel on 1440p
Boom there goes your tower watch it crumble feel the power
""My gaming setup sucks""..
BRO NO IT DOES NOT, YOUR LUCKY
be grateful for what you have. i don’t even have a gaming setup
Need vs want. For most ppl the extra 120hz for $400 isn’t worth it at all. I’ve had both the Samsung G60SD and the Asus PG27ADQP. The difference in actual performance is not noticeable even side by side
i need to get off my 2018 laptop ️
I am the only one using a 4k tv 60htz as my moniter and still play games
Need? I needed to upgrade my monitor from 1080p to 1440p because I wasn't utilising my PC to the fullest and it was kinda hurting my eyes. But you totally didn't need to upgrade
Your my favorite YouTuber
You could get a 4k oled as your second monitor, and get an artisan mousepad if you’re thinking about going pro
Can I please have the old one? I don’t even have a monitor and if I could get that it would help me so much with my budget on gaming set up.
my gaming setup sucks: me :gasp:
I still NEED to upgrade he says. GIVE ME THE OTHER MONITOR PLEASE I BEG
im using 60hz overclocked to 75hz i kinda need a ne one, but im broke...
Bro firstly I don't even have a setup yet second instead of a monitor I'm gonna use an old tv
Can i have the older monitor?
Bro a monitor isnt gonna give u more skillsets. You were just fine with a 360hz oled 1440p
If you don’t want the old one, don’t be shy to share️
Poor rage bait attempt
I mean if you hate your old one so much ill take it like damn, people get pro on 120hz
Bro i have a monitor/tv from 2009 that barely turns on for playing Fortnite on Nintendo switch
Me chillin with a $80 Walmart onn monitor and a $609 pc
Is there any way???
Give me the old one
bru some people make $30000 in their lifetime
30 k and you cant get a 560 hrtz
Such a spoiled brat my setup is a tablet a mousepad a keyboard and A 6 DOLLARS MOUSE WITH USELESS SIDEBUTTONS
There is no way that setup is worth 30 k
THAT DOES NOT SUCK MAN WDYM???
can i get the old one i run a 60hz
360hz to 480hz is not a big difference
im grateful for a 75 hz monitor
For the people saying he’s spoiled or whatever sure yeah everyone would be more than happy to have the other monitor but he does this for content he makes the monitor back
me sitting here with my 60hz montior wonddering why he needs 500hz
no way he took off the hat
Give the the old monitor to me, i need it too:)
Give your old monitor pls
Some peaple dont have moniters, be grateful
What keyboard is that???
I could barely afford a 144hz moniter
Yo gutzy, are all your mousepads glass?
This is a sign to not be like this if i ever make it big in youtube
What was your old monitor called because I need a good not expensive option with those specs
Bro thinks a monitors gonna help him get better XD
What do i need to do to get a gaming laptop
Bro me an my 22in 60h monitor
You should give me your old oled monitor
Please google up how to get it to 6500k
Your say your set up is bad but I don’t even have a monitor or and gaming pc
You will be better than zywoo
give it
I mean if you don’t like it I’ll take it of your hands
Day 170 of asking for a new pc everyday till I get one
I really hope this is a joke
Dude… rich people problems right here, if 360hz is apparently slow, Usain Bolt can’t beat a sloth

If you live inCyprus, you know the heat. Welcome backto the channel. My name is Peter, andtoday I'll be doing something a littlebit different. You see, a friend of minemoved to a new house, and he's an activegamer, so he's been gaming for prettymuch forever. So, I reached out to abrand that I've worked with before, andthey've sent over the Atlas desk. AndI'm really looking forward to unboxingthis thing. It's heavy. So, the boxactually arrived a week ago. We moved iton Thursday. I think today's Sunday.These boxes were very heavy, which Ihope show that they're very durable andvery, very good quality inside. Now,we've moved those boxes and I can seethem right here. I'm looking forward toactually unboxing this because I've hadmy eyes on this desk for a while now.Now, full disclosure, Blacklight didsend me the desk for review and to helpmy friend with this video, but thatdoesn't mean I won't provide any honestreviews about it. This is the space thatwe'll be setting it up.So, yeah, we're not going to go over thetop here. We're just going to set up thedesk. I want to actually see how thisthing functions and if it lives up toits hype. So, let's get to the unboxingand I'll see you on the other side.[Music]Heat.[Music]Heat.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Applause]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]Heat[Music]uphere.[Music]So, that was tiring. Not going to lie.Really, really tiring. But nothing to dowith the desk. Desk was super easy toset up. This desk literally has RGB allover it. I absolutely love these cornerelements of the desk. I mean, they'remag they magnetically attach to the deskand it's just an amazing feature. Youcan manually adjust them and controleach light individually. And obviously,the desk itself is a sitst stand desk,so it will rise. It's heavy. It'sdurable. All right. And the size is notthat bad. I thought at the beginning thesize would be a bit small, but lookingat it now, I actually really like it.It's a perfect size. It can fit his PCon there. We've got a 32-in monitor inthe middle. He's got a 28 in, I believe,on the side vertically. Obviously,thanks to the monitor arms, that doeshelp free up more space on the desk. So,yeah, if you're in the market for agaming desk, something that's full ofRGB all over it, something that's gotadjustable lighting. Um, there is onething I want to try. There is a driverthat I need to install on the computer,and I think that makes the lights syncup. I mean, it's a great start. In time,I think we're going to upgrade the wall.We're going to get some get somepaneling up on the wall, get some morelights, maybe some hex lights from NanolLeaf or something like that. Um, but inthe meantime, let's wait for hisreaction. So, yeah, I'm just waiting forhim to get home and I'm going to filmhis reaction to see what he what hethinks of this.Welcome. Hello.I know you said wait for you, but Ididn't wait.Yeah. No. Come on, man.cable. I did a little bit of cablememory. Oh, it's fine. Oh my god. I willchange it in the near future to getanother one horizontally. One of thecoolest things about this desk comparedto its competitors is that RGB lighting.So, you can actually customize it withina dedicated app by black light. And youcan you can have the lights sync upbased on the music that you're playingand also have them sync to various gamesthat you're playing as well. This way itgives you completely full immersion intothe actual game itself. The lights willchange color depending on what gameyou're playing and what colors are shownon the screen. This is done via USB uhcable that comes within the desk. Sobasically you plug the desk into yourcomputer via the USB cable and let thedriver do its thing. That is the onestandout feature compared to itscompetitor. That paired with how heavythis desk is. It shows its durability aswell. Fact that it comes with a dualmotor system means it's sturdy enough.It's quiet when it rises and quiet whenit's lowers down as well. Does come witha magnetic mouse pad as well. The deskitself is magnetic. So, it's got allthose features just like its competitor.As well, you can buy various accessoriesfor it including a headphone standholder as well that you can slide on theside of the desk. You've got twoprogrammable buttons, and I love thefact that it comes with these extrabuttons that control the lighting. Imean, it it really is completelycustomizable, and the fact that thatlighting can actually change dependingon what game you're playing or whatmusic you're playing just immerses youstraight into the desk setup, and Iabsolutely love that. Overall, this deskis aimed at gamers. So, if you are agamer and you're looking for a desk,this one is definitely one to check out.What do you think of the lights? I thinkthat's one of the main differences withothers. Well, it is cuz it's it'sactually very reactive to every move youmake in the game despite the game youplay. Yeah. It changes on everything.Let's go. Let's go. Let me chooseanother one. Boom. There we go. There wego. Lovely. Yeah. It's so nice with thelights. Yeah.Sniper light. Oh, now it's on. So, thelights actually do change with the game.Yeah, they they change the game. Eachshot, each death, each everything itchanges. So, now that you've had thisdesk for a while, would you recommend itto other people? I would actuallyrecommend it cuz even when I'm workingon it, I just press the button it goesup and I'm standing while I'm working,which is nice. Researching as well,studying. It's lovely, man. It sets themapart. It's truly a gaming desk in myeyes. Very compact. The length is goodfor a dual screen setup, plus to haveyour desktop on. And with everything,it's it's a very respectable desk and avery nice one as well. I would recommendit to other people as well. I reallylike the chair to be honest cuz when I'mgaming with the with the cushion lumbarsupport and it just changes the game.I'm straight. I'm sitting straight. I'mplaying. There's no discomfort. There'sno pain in my bones. And if I just gettired of it, I can just, you know, thereyou go. Goes down and I'm back in actionagain. Thank you so much for watching.If you made it this far, of course,smash that like button, give me asubscribe, and um let me know if youwant me to do any more of these or ifyou have any more questions about thisdesk. Again, thank you so much toBlacklight for sponsoring this video.Honestly, it's a good desk. It's areally, really good desk. And if you'relooking for a gaming desk, one with alot of lights, like I said, definitelylook at this one. I'll catch you in thenext one. Bye.[Music]","Oh… oh my…. I love those corner pieces.

This lighting effect looks really cool, I love it!
this is what my dream looks like
Beautiful
Can you set up my gaming room for me? I wish I was the guy in the video.
Cant mount anything to the sides... Looks like a magnus knockoff
Hi Peter, you have quality videos! Love it. 

I just wanna ask, I scroll down on your feed. I can see that you had your Sihoo V1 then replaced it with Sihoo Doro then started using gaming chair. I love my secret lab but somehow my blood circulation on my leg is the problem, so i've been searching for a perfect chair (budget friendly) to have my back up during long hours. I've been eyeing this Sihoo V1 chair, may I ask why you shifted to Doro then lastly to Secretlab? 

Your response is a huge help. Thank you so much!
Fico mais bonito so aque em Moçambique e em possível alguém faz isso para ti
Ngl these corner light rgb thingys are cringe af

Now I'll wait and goplay some video games. Are you gaming?No, babe. I'm making bread.[Music]Literally the best bread I've ever had.Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Fle, Nick Diovani,y'all better watch your back. I'm comingfor your jobs.","Bro wasn't kidding when he said that we gonna review kitchen items now
He even had to flex premium ingredients
Now thats what I call a true gamer, people say gamers dont get anywhere in life, but I honestly find them very skilled
never in my life i imagine seeing dino with kitchen products ads. 

bro is a breadwinner
""I'm coming for your jobs"" is the craziest shit to say after pressing a button on a machine hilarious
Now we need to see the grill
Can confirm that Butter has culture. It has a finace podcast biweekly. Its also a relationship guru.
""Glacier filtered water""
The butter is so cultured it’s fighting for its rights
bro is really transitioning from gaming channel to cooking right before our eyes
Mans butter got me feeling like a peasant.
This a cooking channel now bro ...slowly slowly it'll be an all-rounder channel
Gordon Ramsey: It's RAW
We're going from gaming to cooking ahh moment
“Are u gaming”
“No babe I’m making bread”
This is the most brilliant sponsor ad I've ever seen
That's prolly the best butter joke
This guy is quickly becoming one of my favorite creators
Damn that production thooo
he just threw all the ingredients in and skipped the boring part and let the machine magically make the bread!
This man was born gifted not just in games but advertising and he is funny unreal.
Masasabi ko lang jan, TEKENLOGIA!
dino is other level hhahahaha as a pinoy i love him
i might be spoiled af for saying this but i love how he's flexing stuff i can use on a daily basis.
Wow. Now this is premium cooking channel.
Waiting for him to go fishing
Wtf... you are so funny!!
Heres comes the cooking arc
HE'S TOO GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!
I love their bread makers!!!!!!!!! They are so good!!!
Was expecting Dino to make Pandesal
Dino is so humble.
his wife jumpscared me because i always hear that one question
that actually looks so good
Damn, I liked this video twice organically cause I love it
Bro I wanna see some chicken adobo cooking
I love how he included Nick like he's the top ""chef"" on the platform
The wit and the humor all in one place. Bro, you got my respect.
Dude makes 1 dollar bread and threatens Gordon Ramsay for his Jobs
This character you’ve created is hilarious, Dino you’ve provided me with many many laughs. Thank you I really wish I could be successful in a similar way.
He literaly told the chef's that he is coming for their jobs using a breadmaker well done
Welcome back to TLC.
Bro im really disappointed that you don't have a maid apron
The callouts are crazy
You got me on the podcsat part! HAHAHAHAH BALIW KA TALAGA DINO! HAHAHHA
Bro literally said ""Hand selected, Ultra Premium bread flour...""
Love how you imitate gordon with ""in,"" lol
He’s slaying it
I love how he throws shade on real chefs when all he did was throw ingredients in a machine
You Played Doom Eternal but you never played Stella Blade
That cultured butter line kills me.
This channel has evolved from a gaming channel to a 3am appliances show
since when this this became cooking channel. I just took 2 week break from youtube
The Cultured grass fed butter got me
Lakas maka ""Glacier Filtered Water""
Look it’s Freddy Bakery!!
This tarnish doesn't need a maiden, bro is already a maiden in its own right
in his cooking channel era
Bro's the breadwinner of his family
""It probably has a podcast""
ataya hambugero kaau dinocornely
The most buttery joke
He's transitioning to the cooking channel now.
How did i know he was gonna wink? 

I did at the same time
Guitar Solo: ️
Stuff that requires 0 skills: ️
That response was legendary
God I love you style in this social media universe it’s even better when you are baked
A man in the life of a day
He wasn't lying about making bread. Need to see if this would work with my wife
In Germany we say „Gutes Brot“ no but really in Germany we have great bread you might need to try it
Lets admit it, bro is premium
Wkwkwkwk.. salute king of everything 🫡
""I'm coming for your jobs""

Elon musk: find me this guy and hire him immediately
Dino is goated! Literally
Gaming channel= 
House husband channel=
Fortified dry milk = Bear Brand
Bro is about to start his kitchen ark
i love the Ms Rachel ""in""
Dang bro u didn't have to cook us like that.
Since you mentioned Gordon, I'll only believe it if Gordon Ramsay gives your bread an approval
Baking bread = 
Coming for their jobs =
That might be fine bread but I have a suggestion for a bread thats better. You will need 3 cups (about 360g) whole wheat flour, 1,5 cups (360ml) warm water, 2 tablespoons honey (or maple syrup), 2 tablespoons olive oil (or melted butter), 2 teaspoons active dry yeast, and 1,5 teaspoons salt. If you want, throw in some sunflower seeds or oats for extra texture. When its done, let it cool on a rack before slicing. If it comes out a bit dry, add a splash more water next time. 
If you want it even healthier you should make sourdough bread. The body can digest sourdough way better if your stomach cant handle the other ways that good.
Take it from someone coming from the land of the bread
Collab na ni lumpia queen
Dino is a true Filipino, because we Pinoy's are mostly in the kitchen. ;)
Cultured butter fighting for its rights got me
Cant believe he didn't say ""bread, out""
I need you to use that giller to make giller to
Bro just auto baked a and challenged the world class master chefs
Probably the richest Filipino ever
imagine gordon ramsay come to his house to judge him
That isn't premium until you make milk bread
""Cultured butter"" must be the most expensive ingredient on the list
He's Advertising All Those Ingredients
Love that one button action over there!!!
Damn, his childhood honed solar hands popped out from the oven, unfortunately.
Hell yeah, kitchen channel
""IN!""....""Watch""....beep! GoT BuTTuh?!
...chefs kiss!!️
Tijgerbrood is the best in existence
Hand Selected Flour is crazy

Long overdue. We'refinally building this gaming setup at astudio. And we're at where any goodgaming setup begins. Orange County,California. Let's go. I don't know whatI'm getting. How much you think I'mgoing to spend?[Music]I have a checklist of things that weneed for this setup. Starting with thePC. I already have one, but we'll seewhat they have because maybe I'llupgrade my PC. Hey, of course we come onthe most busy day. 5080s. 5080s. I wasreally hoping for a 5090. Maybe we won'tupgrade the PC today. I really want onethough. Low key. Should I just get itanyways even though it's not a 5090? No.How long you think I need? Long enough.Six. [ __ ] one of these. Oh, they gotcable management stuff. Oh, I need that[ __ ] bro. Yeah, you do. My [ __ ] Weshould make a video fixing Josh's setupone day. We should show him my PC withthe leg stand. That [ __ ] tilt, dude.There's a lot of zip ties here, but tobe honest, zip ties are overrated andit's a lot of work if you want to takeit down. Something like this is a littlebetter because it's velcro, like velcroties, and it's easier to take off. Youdon't have to cut them. Something likethis as well, just to like tidy up thecables together. I know I'm going toforget something. That's That's theproblem. You have the Ethernet cablealready, right? Yeah, we need that. Ishould have had a plan. I never have aplan. It's like the most boring microcenter haul ever. We'll get some morecool stuff. What the What is that? Yougot to buy a new camera. No, that'sscared me. I'm broke. Hey Josh, you needa new blow dryer. Tell me why I walkedin his room once. He's using anelectronic air duster to dry his hair.I'm like, ""Bro, I got one. I should usemine."" It wasn't even blowing air, but Iwas blowing dust exposing me. You don'tneed no RGB. Oh, check. That boy tall.You might need Sony monitors. Sonymonitors. I think we have one. Probablynot the same one cuz this new ever. Oh,that's a new new one. Yeah, this onejust came out probably have this oneright here. It looks like has like thesame stand. So, this one's 480 Hz. Wait,they're both 480 Hz. Wait a minute.Similar specs. It's 2K 480. This is 2K480. Is that same size? 27 in. I'll beright back, man. We're in the monitorsection. It was looking grim. Normally,I'd also need to pick up a monitor, butI already have one at home uh thanks toSony. They have one in stock and I'm washoping to have a dual monitor setup, sothey're going and they're grabbing itfor me right now. Oh, you got it for meright there. Here you go. All right,guys. Oh, it is the same monitor. Is itthe same monitor? Bang. Yeah. Yeah, thesame name. Sort of the same box. Is thisthe last one? It's the only one. Thankyou, guys. Have a good one. Let's go.With this monitor, it's the first timeI'm not buying monitor mounts because ofthe design of the monitor mount. It'sactually pretty sick. And I'll show youguys more later. I think we're good.That's a wrap for Micro Center. UnlessJosh, you want some? Yeah. $10,000. Buyas much as you want. $50 for a cable? Idon't know if I want it that bad. $50?Oh, it's the goat. The goat. This islike the LeBron of esports, bro. It'scrying out.Actually, is the goboy. What you know about this? Come on,bro. Stop playing. What you know aboutthis?Only one they had.Is that crazy?[Music]Help me out.[Music]Black and white. One, two. Car has aura.You already know what where you at.Somehow we always end up here in everyvideo, right Josh? Like I swear I don'tcome here all the time. Yeah, we're justgetting like a bunch of desk accessoriesand a countertop for the table. [ __ ] inthe car, bro. What? Don't say that.[Music][Music]It's been a while since you guys haveseen the studio. This area is a totalmess, but we're working on it. We gotsome small progress here. The KiloEscape has made a return. We got somerandom jumbosized Pokémon cards. Shoutout to Cracks Toys, my boy Matt. SomePro Grails. This little area is kind ofcool. We got Josh eating this littleshell. I love this area. This plant ishuge now. I got this plant a year ago.Look how much it's grown. It's all theway over here now. You guys rememberthis living room. We turn around. We gota live streaming setup. By the way, letme turn this light on. Much better. Thishas been a lot of fun. Bubble M is thegreatest Pokémon card ever made. Car'shere.But yeah, this is like the last part ofthe studio. I really need some seriouswork. There's this big wall over here.I'm going to clear all of this out andthen build my new gaming setup.It's been a while since I actually hadWell, okay. I have a gaming setup athome, but it's kind of like a makeshiftsetup. Plan to have this place for along time. So, this setup is very, verypermanent. But also, we're taking a verydifferent approach than his setups inthe past. I still stream, not as much.So, the main focus here is it lookinggood, not the functionality. Although,I'm not going to build a setup that'simpractical to use.[Music]One problem. So, tabletop thing that webought, it's too small cuz like thispiece is supposed to connect the twolegs, but um as you can tell, it'staller than the desk. And then this thisis the top. The depth of the desk isalso smaller. I realized what I didwrong cuz when I bought this frame, itwas supposed to originally be for abigger tabletop. I get what you mean.So, it's going to be like hanging likeYeah. Yeah. So, we got a new one. Oh mygoodness. Things always go wrong.Finally, since the last clip that youguys saw, it's been about 3 or 4 days. Iwent to the bay, visited family, andalso went to a Warriors game. We went ona whole mission today just to get thistable top. I know it doesn't look likeanything special, and trust me, itisn't, but it's exactly what I waslooking for.So, this is birch plywood. I got it fromHome Depot. It's finished already. Um, Imight have to stand up and fix up acouple random things, but it's wood.It's never going to be perfect, and I'mperfectly fine with it being unfinishedor like not perfect. Long story short,we went to a Home Depot. They had thewood that we wanted. Pause. But themachine to cut the wood didn't work. Andoriginally this was 4 ft deep, which istoo long for a desk, but I feel likethis is basically perfect. Now, themoment of truth is making sure that thisthing fits on this thing. 1,000% Ishould have measured it. Oh, barely.It's like an inch. So, I don't know ifyou can see,but yeah, we're good. It clears. This isgoing to be a sick desk. By far the mostunique desk I've ever built. And it'ssuper simple. So, perfect. Step numberone, we got to build this frame. Then,I'm debating whether or not I actuallywant to put or drill or glue thecountertop to the frame itself or justput it on top and then put like rubberor something so it doesn't, you know,scrape or scratch. We'll cross thatbridge when we get there.[Music]What is in here?Sounds like screws.Voila.Tons of them.These are like the little feet thing.And then there's a little beam in themiddle to make sure everything's stable.Hey,perfect. No, this is exactly how I wantit. This desk is huge. This desk ishuge. The way we rock. Scary. Live lifeon the edge. It's It's massive, bro.Hey, it looked better, huh? Big olddesk. Have you ever seen a gaming setupdesk this big? Yeah, it looks like adining table. Lookie. Nice. 3 2 1[Applause]Weno.[Music][Music]What do you think? Are youall the way? No.Nice.Cool. So, desk is mostly done. This isprobably the coolest desk I've everowned. Not the most unique desk, but Ithink it's pretty different for likegaming setups. What you think, Josh?Yeah. Jump on it.It finally break it out. Okay, so fromhere, I'd probably normally startbuilding the actual setup itself. What Iwant to do is start putting this stuffon the wall. Start with mounting thestuff. Have these pegboards. Probably goeven from the middle, left and right. Ialso have this shell, which I'llprobably go offset onto this sidebecause I already have a basketball loopright there.[Music]I want it to be like[Music][Music]Can't help myself. See what this feelslike with a real chair. I've alwayswanted a desk. It's huge. It's a new dayand I recruited alltime greats.He brought in the big guns. Oh yeah. Ialways had this dream to get thismassive desk, but also I didn't realizethat it would like bend this much. So Itook a quick trip to IKEA and yeah,let's do this earn stuff. Well, time toget to work. Since this desk is so thin,I have to use like the thinnest screwsever. Like, they're so tiny. What? It'llbe fine, right? Yeah.They're um half an inch because the deskthickness is 38 of an inch. Y'all shouldsee my POV right now.Big ass eyes. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. So,y'all see I think you guys can see howmuch it's bending just by that thatspot.Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have muchfaith in these little screws, butOh, if you're wondering why I have twowhite dogs, one is our friend. Yeah.Looks good. No more bend. Missionaccomplished. So, with the desk done, wecan now get to building the actual setupitself. Monitor stand is so cool. Theyprobably get mad at me for doing this,too, huh? And any good setup starts withthe monitor. Thankfully, while Sony sentme that one, I bought this one. Andalso, this video is sponsored by Sony.Micro Center had one last one of theSony M10S monitor. For any setup ofmine, at least especially gaming setups,you need to have at least two monitors.The Sony M10S is a monster performerdisguised as a minimalistic productivitymonitor. The chassis and design languagescream simple, but the specs scream topof the line. 480 Hz, 27 in OLED, QHD1440p, small bezels, easy setup,lightweight, minimalistic stand, and athin display with a innovative coolingsystem. I genuinely can't name anythingwrong with the M10s. Oh yeah, and as Imentioned earlier, this is the firsttime I'm completely ditching a deskmount. I still have nightmares trying tomount 30 lb monitors. Not fun at all.But with this, I feel like I'm notsacrificing anything at all. All whilehaving no compromise on performance, I'mall in. I've been able to use my otherSony M10S for about a month already.Loved it so much I went out of my way tobuy another and Sony doesn't even knowthat. While they are the sponsor oftoday's video, I will say if thismonitor has taught me anything, it'sthat the days of going for the highestrefresh rate monitor and ignoringeverything else are over for me. I stillremember when 240 Hz was all the craze.Now double that and add every premiumquality of life feature into awell-designed chassis and you'll findthis monitor, the Sony M10S. You cancheck it out with the link in my bio.Sony, thank you again for sponsoringthis video and helping me build my dreamgaming setup for like the 75th time.Okay, so this is going to go up. So thenthis is going to go like this. And thenthey like[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]$50.[Music]It was orange. So I had to[Music]like this thing's a smiley face.real ones from like my community and thestreams know the importance of thesmiley face. So, if you know, you know,we also had to cut it. Shout out toErnstell for the idea. I would havenever never thought of that. Hey,hey,it should be in the middle of this andthis way. No, I don't really know wherethe[Laughter]Give me that.A little cricket. Like just shimmy me itthis way. Just Oh,yeah. That's good. Perfect. Thisactually does look cool.All right. Taking this off.All right. So, this is a magazine I gotplaying basketball, but it's signed byKD. Oh, wait. I should move this.Thought this would be a good place forit, too. And it's orange with thepegboard. I didn't know what to put onit, but I think it looks okay for now. Idon't need to overdo it. Yeah.[Music]I always wanted this mic cuz it's white.Oh my god. Are you okay?Is it okay? We're good. Is it recording?Yeah. Oh my god. Chat broke his lens.How much is the lens? Two racks. Betterget a million views. I don't even wantto record anymore. Where should I putthis? Well,thank God. Hey, Sony, how about wesponsor a lens video?[Music][Music]It's day three building in the setup andtoday we're going to finish it. Right,Josh? Mhm. I'm about to I'm about totell himwhat theall my hard work. Here's a littleprogress report of where we're at.Thanks to Ernstell for helping meyesterday. Put it on the desk. Hey Har,what you think? No. No. Come back. Har,say cheese. The crazy part is that shegoes on the table at home. Um, afterWhat happened? Huh? Still my toe. No.What happened to my tripod?We got this picture up yesterday.Decorated a little bit, of course. Gotthe monitor set up. I put the 151Charizard right here. I think I want toput the full evolution. I feel like thatwould be sick. That sucks. What? Youdon't got it.You did it again.That's you, bro. It's tough. Remember myold sub um sub emotes? S smiley faces.Josh, if I put you in charge of cablemanagement, you think you can do it?Do you mind? It's everywhere. Today,we're starting with cable management cuzclearly uh well, I don't have that manycables plugged in yet, but it's the mostimportant part of any any setup, period.I got this big old desk. So, that's mymission. This shouldn't be that hard.I'm going to start with this powerstrip. We got to get it mounted righthere. Um, I don't really have an exactidea of where I'm going to put it. Ijust kind of put it somewhere and thencall it a day. This a good spot, right?All right. Can you hold that side up?This is so weird. Hurry up, bro. No, I'mlowkey enjoying my time down here. [ __ ]Hurry up.All right. I should do the other side,huh? Yeah.Oh my dog.Why are you still here?I kind of want to move the uh cablemanagement thing to the left, too.This is going to be pretty boring, butumlots of cables. I'll update you when Ihave something else.maybe some advice or insight for peopletrying to manage their cables. A problemmost people run into when building agaming setup is that their cables aretoo short and that's why they can'tcable manage it. Definitely invest insome longer cables. I usually if it's ashort distance, I do at least 6 ft. Thisone's 6 ft. This one's 10 ft.And I even got an extension for like apower extension just in case I neededit. Things like this always make adifference. In the past, I would gosuper crazy with the cable management,but in all honesty, like I'm lazy,especially now. So, I just bought thislittle like rack thing. I'm just goingto put all the cables on there. It's notthat big of a deal to me. As long as thecables aren't touching the floor orhanging, um, then I did my job. Andespecially cuz I know I'm the type ofperson that likes tochange gear. And see, like, look howshort this cable is. But I'm the type ofperson person that likes to change gearand nicely cable managing everything isnot the move when that's the type ofperson I am. Also, I know I used tonever use these things, but somemonitors have like a little cablemanagement thing right here. Definitelyuse them because they're there for areason. Also, when you have a really bigdesk, um cables are going to be likethis. And the only way to really make itlook nice are cable sleeves.So, you know, the cables won't be gone.You can't magically just make themdisappear,but at least you can make it look neat,and that's that's the whole goal here.I'm going to cut this, but I'll show youguys what it looks like after.Would you look at that?Careful. All right. So, I'm in a littlebit of a predicament. I want to put thePC like tucked off in the corner foronce because I always put it on theright side of the desk, but I didn'tthink about how the cables would just besticking out over here and that kind ofit don't make me feel good. So Josh saidI should put a plant here. I was like,""Well, Josh, you actually had a goodidea for once."" This is what I decidedon. I just moved that plant to theground and pushed the um side tableback. But we'll plug everything in andthen I'll try my best to use the cablesleeves to make it look kind of tidy.Obviously cables are cables and they'regoing to be there, but hopefully itlooks okay.One thing about me, it's about thedetails. Got an orange XLR cablefor absolutely no reason. I don't knowif you can tell, but I've been likingorange recently.[Music]Make sure to keep your XLR cablesseparated from the rest of your cables,or else you'll get static in your mic.And another thing, these Velcro ties areway better than zip ties, no matter whatanyone says. Not my best work, but umgood enough for me. You got nuts in hisback. Yeah.What the Why are you not petting me? Hedon't want you to do that no more. Whyyou still crouch like that?Yeah,yeah,yeah. Look, look. It's like I'm racingon father time. Hard to see the visionwhen you only see dollar signs. Stick toplan A cuz the B feel like compromise.Thinking [ __ ] sweet. This the like theydon't advertise. Supposed to use yourvoice, but when you do, you getostracized. Overall, I'm really happywith how it turned out. Feel like theblue here contrasts really well with allthe orange. I added some little detailsbecause well, I love this bag and it'sone of the coolest collabs in gaminghistory up there. Of course, I had toput the Dreamcast. Something about theart on these boxes just looks so cool.And it's nice to have this much space onthe right side of my desk cuz usually myPC is there. And as much as I love myPC, which is still my old PC, the onethat I had at at the house in my setupthere, I just moved it. I like howsimple it looks while still being verycolorful, lots of contrast, and at theend of the day, still me. That chairisn't permanent. I have another chairover there, but um yeah, it's just kindof here for now. Every time I've donelike an all-white setup or a mostlyblacked out setup, it didn't well, itlooked cool, but it didn't really feellike me. This This feels like me. If youremember my original setups, there was alot of black and white contrast. I thinka lot of people try to go for one or theother. The white and the black justcontrast so well. More minimalistic yetstill unique and interesting. Let meknow you think and appreciate you guysfor watching. I'll work on a studio tour for number one.","i think the desk legs are upside down, that metal bar going across the floor is supposed to lay under the top part of the desk so it wont sag
all of lough’s eras are combining into one!

That M10S looks NUTS. Great video as always bro <3

I got a smaller version of this a few months back. L-shaped with a set of drawers, which can be placed at either end.

They're pretty good for kit desks the only issues I have is the sockets on the power board are too close together so I can only use 2/3 of them, would have been nice if the USB on it was usb-c or at least higher wattage, and the remote for the LED strip clashes with the one for the lights in my PC...

I share vlogs, bookish content, and gaming streams🖤✨","Hey, what's up? Hello. My name is Alexisand welcome to today's video where we'regoing to be doing a bit of a gaming desksetup refresh. I've had this gaming roomset up for about a year now and we'vegone through some transformations forthe room itself, but my setup behind mehas actually stayed the same for acouple years now. My main monitor behindme I got about 3 years ago, and thismonitor right here, I actually got in2016 because my grandmother gave me aBest Buy gift card. So, I think it wastime for a new monitor. So, that's whatthe main thing is going to be. So, I gota brand new monitor and I'll have thedetails of that here, as well as someother fun little accessories that I got.I'm also really excited because I gotthese monitor arms that like the swivelones that go on the desk. So, I'll beable to get rid of this thing that themonitor is sitting on, which will clearup a lot of space. So, without furtherado, let's go ahead and start cleaningoff this desk. I want a fresh startbefore I start unboxing everything.[Music]I am already very overwhelmed.[Music]Okay, so I'm an idiot and I thought mycurrent monitor had the the capabilitiesof getting one of these heers onto theback of it because I swear I bought oneof these monitor stands before, like theVessa swivel monitor things before, andit would fit on the white one on mymonitor, but it wouldn't fit on the oldone. So, I returned it, but now this onedoesn't fit. So, I'm justI'm so confused. So,[Music]I got it to stay up. I literally had toput all my strength into that. Like myass was on this desk tighteningit. Okay, it's too far that way, whichmeans I need to move this more to theleft.Imagine[Music]I don't even like this monitor and Iwent through all this pain andsuffering.These screws,let me These screws are very long. I'mgoing to bring my old monitor back uphere. genuinely hope for the best beforeI have a mental breakdown.It works. It works. Oh my god, it works.Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.I literally Alexis Delarman Rodriguez.Um, my stepfather taught me how to weldand drive a forklift at the age ofseven. I don't know why I ever doubtedmyself. So you see how this ridge ishere. So the screw fits herelike from outside cuz obviously thiscannot go in the circle. The squarecannot go in the circle hole. But theseare way down here. We're back to squareone. Like yeah, there is no way. Knowhow that screw is reaching down there.I was so close. So close. Whateveryou do in life, just make sure you don'tquestion how I did this.Okay.Okay.Got to figure out how to make thisvertical portrait.Yes, sir. I did it. I did it. I did it.Okay. I think this needs to go up. Needto go up a little. I don't know why, butI think this looks kind of bad.Let me put the rest of it together. Letme put the rest of it together. Nextthing is going to be a new mouse pad.Actually, I should probably clean thearea first.Next thing is this monitor light. Okay.Slay. Slay. I like that. Okay. think ofthat, I can confidently say that thiswhole setup has taken 10 years off of mylife. All right, here's the new monitor.I definitely have to play with somesettings because it doesn't lookfantabulous.Here's my second monitor that used to bemy main monitor. It's now vertical. Gotrid of the stand so I have more room formy mouse pad. This is a Keyron K8, Ibelieve, that my boyfriend built for mea couple years ago. This is the LogitechG705 mouse from the Aurora collection.Aurora Aurora collection. Here is theQuintis light bar that I got off ofAmazon. I forgot what this little keypadfellow is, but I use them whenever Iplay Supermarket Simulator, which Ihaven't done in a while. This microphoneI use for streaming. I have no idea whatit's called, but it's not plugged incurrently because the wire has to runfrom there all the way over here, and Idon't feel like showing that right now.and I did tie it all together. I have a1080p Logitech webcam. No idea what thisis called. Don't know where it camefrom, but it's here. Yeah, here's theupdated little setup. Now, I'm alsohappy with how it looks. Everything isjust more sleek. Definitely not thisside of my desk. Need to work on thatnext. And definitelynot back there. My god, that will haveto be a project for tomorrow. For rightnow, I am going to count this as a win.and that genuinely stressed me out and Ithought I was going to have a mentalbreakdown and just start crying. But wedid it. If you made it to this part ofthe video, I really appreciate you forsticking around. But if you did enjoythe video, please leave a like. Let meknow down in comments what you think ofthe new refresh. And also subscribe ifyou're new. Also, I'm sorry for thereally weird lighting. I need to fixthat.","THE SETUP LOOKS SO GOOD!!!

Singlemonitor, side by side, and even thevertical setup. But my favorite is this.Stacked monitors felt a bit strange atfirst, but honestly, it just makes moresense for how I work. So, my main stuffstays on the bottom. Editing, writing,anything I'm actively focused on. And onthe top screen, that's where I putthings like my music, notes, stuff thatI don't need all the time, but wantnearby. And a single screen was clean,but I'd always run out of space. So, thestacked setup works best for me. And no,I don't have to break my neck. It's allin my view.","I prefer stacked as well. However, having your 2nd monitor that high is a recipe for neck pains and problems. I like a tablet sized monitor below my eye level and first monitor.
I use and prefer a stacked steup as well. Two 34"" Curved ultra wide.
also prefer stacked, however I'm running a laptop and use the keyboard. My main screen being the external
This looks awesome!
I have this dual monitor setup but not by choice lol, just how my current space works. My ideal is a main, one side by side, and another vertical
Yes! I love my stacked monitor setup. Couldn’t go back to anything else.
I just have discord on the stacked screen. But I have 3 screens. Work/games on my main and usually youtube on my side monitor. The stacked monitor is above my side monitor and it works really well for me.
what monitors do you use?
My setup as well.
I had this set up then recently went side-by-side with one ultra wide and a regular 27 inch and thinking about going back to this ASAP
really nice bro. I want to do the same screen setup now for coding.
Stacked life for me
Bro you camera work is clean. The video is so good. is this HDR the colours are so vibrant?
What desk is that?
Love the gray brick walls. Are they panels? Link?
your lighting looks so good! edited right?
stacked is best for me too, ordering a 2nd screen, what size are your monitors
If my two monitors were bigger than they are now I would also stack them.
Ты в курсе для чего нужны подлокотники?
Damn 
Bro your monitor?
I have an old T420, am I strange?
Yeah the monitors are superb! Are they tv’s or pc monitors?? And if you don’t mind, can I know the brand and models??
Why this short automatically increased brightness of my phone?
what scaling are you using at your main monitor?
Nice. What are the monitors and brace you use?
What kind of monitor arm do you use for your stack
what do you use to mount the monitors?
This is my setup as well
Strain in the eyes left the chat
Why just not have one 48"" OLED one
What monitor arm are you using ?
Is this tv or monitor ? Can you give all model name ?
Wallpaper pls

This might be oneof the worst eras of gaming. The sleekminimal look, the top-of-the-line tech,and the mini ITX PCs. Now, the oldsetups with all the RGB and noise issomething I've been chasing for thelongest time. But after scrollingthrough hundreds and hundreds of thesecompetitive gaming setups, they aredefinitely starting to grow on me, and Ithink it's time to start switchingthings up. Then I'll comment down belowsome of the best competitive gaming gearor tech peripherals that you know of andfollow for part two of the revamp.","I've had a minimal setup for years now, just helps me focus & not get distracted.
I don't know why, but this reminds me of how McDonalds (and other franchises) swap from colourful, thematic food outlets to the minimal, toneless, brutalist restaurants.
Worst error has to be a hot take or the worst ragebait, a gaming setup is meant for gaming and a comp setup does that perfectly
Wooting 60he is crazy
Go for the wooting 80he and the razer viper v3 pro is a alienware 360hz monitor and the hyperX cloud 3 headset you should go for the artisan zero mid or soft mouse pad, and for the pc try to get at least a 4070ti super and a ryzen 7 or a cord i9
yeah got any tips on how i can save money for a gaming desk or a monitor
This is better than rgb why im doing this as my setup
Hey can u give a phone tour like of ur lockscreen and homescreen layout?
crazy how much the consumer market is dictated by TikTok trends. You don't have to stop liking something just because it's not popular anymore.. That's genuinely sad. Validation seeking has never been higher amongst any generation to date.
Logitech gpro superlight 2 and wooting 60he hits hard
For a comp setup that’s the best equipment
Logitech G pro wireless x2 the Artizans mouse pad hyper x cloud 3s and an oled monitor.
wooting he60 and gpro superlight
Wooting, skypad and finalmouse mouse. Thats it
Some of y'all are influenced by social media trends at a disturbing level. If your likes and dislikes are constantly changing based on the content that you're drowning yourself in, what do you think that says about your personality? (hint: you don't have one)
What’s that third monitor’s wallpaper called I really want that
wooting 60 he and Logitech super light or the final mouse any glass mouse pad and olded monitors
I came because of your ""Free pc"" video. You asked for that and I'm willing to steal your RAM since I only have 2GB
Steel series tkl
G pro two super light
zero mouse, wooting 60he, cloud glass pad and i use the senheizar 200 sorry if i wrote that bad but those are sick and they are not that expensive, i didnt have any problem with the cable.
Wooting superlight v2 and glas mauspad
monitor dell aw2523hf, keyboard geonworks venom 60he, mouse viper v3 pro or wlmouse beast x pro, mousepad artisan zero soft or type 99 mid
Get a hitscan Hyperlight, artisan pad, lethal gaming gear pad or if you want glass a wallhack.
And then for the keyboard, buy a wooting or even build a custom venom60he
THe best era nerd
Razer products and the viper v3 pro
Hyper x cloud alpha headset 

Wooting 60he keyboard 

G pro x super light 2 mouse 

Glass mousepad
Ig everyone wants to have an XQC neck
U need a good office chair NOT A GAMING CHAIR
Try a glass mouse pad
Anything with noctua
Artisan zero mouse pad, logitech G pro X super light two apex pro or whoting keyboard
all that just to be stuck in gold lol

Uh, but I planon making more videos this summer.Not during school, probably. Maybe. Idon't know. I don't know yet. But, uh,let's get into the video. All right,guys. This is my updated setup tour. So,let's get right into it. First, we'regoing to start off with the keyboard.It's the Razer Husman Mini. Love it. UhI may or may not have switched some ofthe key caps uh with or not. Yeah. Yeah.Keycaps and some of the switches becausesome of them broke. I have no idea how.So yeah, that's it's pretty good. Thenwe have my PulsarX2 V2.Love it. It's pretty light if you askme. Soyeah,here we have my main monitor. It's a MSIRed Dragon. I don't know the exactmodel, but it's 250 Hz. I use 250 Hz,though. I just use 240.Sothis this is my uh second monitor. Gotthis yesterday. It's been pretty good sofar. It's uh 100 Hz cuz, you know, it'sa second monitor when you're reallyusing it that much, so it's not going tobe that good, but it's good to me, youknow. And this is my light bar. I don'tknow what brand it's from. Uh I'll tryto find it and then put it in thedescription maybe.And this is myum mic.It's what you heard in the uh the introof the video. So, yeah, as you can hear,it's pretty crisp.I don't know the exact brand either, butit's pretty good. This boomis just an Amazon basics one. Not thatreally good. Don't really.And um here's my high ground mouse padthat's been insanely good to me so far.I've put this thing in the washingmachine so many times and it's been ithasn't like been destroyed or anything.People say that putting it in thewashing machine is not good for your uhyour mouse pads, but I don't reallybelieve. All right, so here's the PCthat y'all love to talk trash about.Yeah. Yand from now on I'm only going to beupgrading my PC. Okay. So, I recentlybought uh more sticks of RAM for the PCcuz currently it only has 8 GB of RAM.So, now it's going to have16 or 32. I don't know yet. I'll see howmuch money I get.

Actually,you probably can't because I have him.No, I'm done. We made a boo boo. It's sopretty. It's so pretty.[Music]Hey guys, welcome or welcome back to mychannel. My name is Destiny if youdidn't already know. And as you can seebehind me, there's a desk fully loadedwith everything. And if you're comingfrom my last video where I did my wholedesk setup cuz I was building it, I toldyou guys I was going to build a PC aswell. And guess what? I built my PC. Andshe's standing right here, right next tome. And y'all y'all are going to see it.You guys are going to see it. You justhave to keep watching the video. Um, Ijust would like to say the last video Iposted about my desk was about 4 monthsago. I understand that, but life wasfalling apart. I was in school takingfive classes. Why would I do that tomyself? I don't know. Actually, I doknow. I want to get up and get out ofschool now that we're in summer. I mean,it's not that any better. I'm takingthree classes in the summer, but I havesome more time than taking five, sowe're good. However, yes, there is afully loaded desk behind me. And I didfilm me building my PC. There was a lotof mishaps. Um, I filmed a video of mebuilding my PC and I never end upshowing you the final product. So, thisthis recording will be me showing thefinal product.[Music]Um, push it down like this. You know,I'm not pushing it all the way down.Yeah, go all the way down. Oh, it broke.Oh my goodness. You broke it. Now, thisis a lot of resistance. I can'tI'm not doing that. I'm already hearingstuff. push doesn't me Jeff. I'm I don'twant to break the stuff. That's Thereyou go. I feel like a tech geek. I feellike qualify to be in tech. Like Ishould be making 200k a year. Knock itdown. Stop putting it up. You're makinghair partic follicles. No one's going tosee it. Do X or dots. What is this? Canyou stick it on, Jeff? It looks likedamn worm. Looks like stick it on.Jeff, please screw it in. You're makingme nervous. So, currently, um, we made aboo boo. We have to wipe off the thermalpaste cuz I put way too much cuz I havea happy hand. I I I thought more morether thermal paste was good. It's not.Um, update. It's an hour and a halflater. Um, I'm not sure if we're evenclose to being done. What we did dothough is we changed out the fans thatthis PC came with because I heard thatit's loud. It's not that good. And nowI'm just installing the mothermotherboard. How'd you turn it on? Allright. So, uh, it's on. It's on. Butthere's still a yellow light.But this time, the yellow light's forthe RAM. So, that's lowkey better thanthe CPU. Yes. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.Do you understand how many how muchtimes we had to take off the CPU? Atleast it's not the CPU this time. All wehave to do is just uncip. Why are weturning off and on though? Ah, it's sopretty. So pretty. It's so pretty. Sopretty. So pretty. After furtheranalysis,it is not a RAM issue. It's a VGA andthat means GPU. We don't got a GPU. Stopshaking the camera. Excited. We don'thave a GPU. So that's fine. We're goingto get the GPU tomorrow. Do you know howmany hours it took us? We started atlike 6:15 yesterday. Yes. And it's like10:00. It's 9:00 right now. It is thenext day. Say hi, Jeff. Hello. The PC isdone. It's done. It's finished. It'scute. She's She's real cute in all herglory and everything. Um, two thingsthat we still need to install that camein today. I got my GPU today. It'sstanding right here. And then I alsohave my fan right here. And then I havemy cable management that I just orderedfrom Amazon that came in yesterday. Lookat the little turmoil, the actual likestress we went through. See, there's alot of time skips, a lot of jumps. Ididn't record a lot cuz one, my cameradied. I didn't have a spare battery andit just got too technical.That that was that the snap? No. Are yousure? That's the wrong snap.Are you sure? Yeah. Why don't Don't dothat. Don't do some.I'm going to tell you guys all theprices I spent on everything and if Idon't remember, I'll just put it in myAmazon link. I think it's already in thedescription below, but if I missanything that I said in the video, letme know and I'll just add it to thelink. I would say personally for me, mydesk setup is a budget friendly desksetup. Now, when you find out the pricethat I pay for everything, you may notsay that it's a a budget friendly desksetup, but everything that I got was notall at once. I literally got my deskback in November. What month is it?June. Every time I would try to buysomething for my desk, I would alwaysmake sure it's the cheapest option. It'scute, but still the cheapest option. So,I'm doing my best here. Without furtherado, come closer and let's go get intothe desk tour. Okay, so first let's getinto the peripherals. I believe that'swhat you call it, peripherals, andthat's like the keyboard, mouse,speakers, or whatever that's connectedto the monitor or the PC. I think that'sthe peripherals. Also, the lightingchanges in this video. I've had thisCanon G7X for like 3 4 years now, and Istill don't know how to use it. So, I'mtrying my best. I'm trying my best. Andwith every video that I post from nowon, it's going to get better. So, myfirst thing that I love is my keyboard.I did mention this in my last video. Itis a Miji Majigi Maji keyboard. I thinkI got this for like $35 on Amazon. It'sthe prettiest keyboard. It's blue andpurple. I wanted a all purple keyboard,but I couldn't find one. Like a allwhite and purple keyboard, but Icouldn't find one. So, there's a ant onmy keyboard. Calm down.Let's calm down. Um, I feel like theblue kind of matches my mouse pad, so itdoesn't really matter. And then I alsogot this on Amazon. I have no idea whatthe price was for this. I think this wasabout maybe $18.99 or 12. It's either$12.99 or $18.99. One of the both. Ifeel like like that's a good price forthis. It's purple. And if you guysdidn't know already, my favorite coloris purple. I don't use this, by the way.I hate the feeling of a wrist rest onme. It feels so like constricting,claustrophobic. I don't know what it is,but I don't like it. So, I don't use it,but it is there for the aestheticswhenever I want to take photos. I gotthis mouse cuz my previous mouse was awhite mouse that was like $10 on Amazonand it stopped working. I don't knowwhat happened. I didn't drop it. Ididn't pour water on it. Nothinghappened to it. It just stopped working.It stopped connecting. Like, it turnson. The blue light will turn on. Iconnected to my computer and it justdoesn't move. So, I don't really know.So, I ended up getting this one. I thinkthis one was about like $28 or maybe itwas 30. I don't know. This is a littlebit more expensive. This is the LogitechG305 mouse and it's really good. I likeit. You could change the DPI. It's u Ithink that's what it's called. The thebasically how fast the the sensitivityof the mouse is. It does have a loudclicker though.I don't like that. My other mouse that Igot for $10.99 on Amazon, no soundclick. You couldn't hear it forBut now,no, I'm done. There's not much I can do.Um, for my webcam, I got my webcammainly for streaming and I haven'tstreamed yet because I'm trying to finda good schedule since I do work a 9 to5and every time after my 9 to5 I getsleepy and tired. We're we're working onit. I forgot what it's called, but Ithink it's in my Amazon storefront, butit's the Logitech C920,I think, or something. But it's reallygood. It's super good. If you ever getthis webcam and you're like, ""Oh mygosh, Destiny lights me. It's not thatgood."" It's because you don't reallyhave great lighting. any camera, if youdon't have good lighting, like lightingon the left and right of you, not evenjust in front of you, like on the leftand right of you, it's going to lookbad. I make this 1080p HD camera looklike it's a 4K camera. I'm sorry. Youjust need to get into the lighting. Youneed to get on YouTube. You need to geton TikTok and figure out the bestlighting setups for when you'restreaming or for webcams or whatever,and you're going to get just right. Igot this for, I think, like $80. It'sexpensive for a camera that is 1080p,but it's not that bad. Now, if we gocloser, this part came with the deskthat I built. Yeah, I use it just forlike just to hide everything that'sunder here. I might take this out justbecause it makes my desk feel a littlebit smaller than it is. Like if I put itright here, it may look a little bitnicer, but my desk feels smaller. Buteither way, let's take this out and seewhat's under it. So, what I have underit is my speakers for my monitor and myKVM switch. First of all, the best thingI've ever bought with my money is thisKVM switch. I was so stressed before Igot this KVM switch, y'all. Every singletime I wanted to switch from working cuzI work from my work laptop. My worklaptop is a 2017 MacBook Air that my jobgave to me. And then I have my PC,y'all. Every time I wanted to game on myPC or go on Discord or just go on my PCto use my keyboard, I would have toswitch. I'm sorry, y'all. I had tochange the SD card cuz it was full. Soanyways, back to what I was saying.Every time I literally would have tounplug my mouse, unplug my keyboard,unplug my speaker, and transfer back tomy PC. And then the next morning, I haveto do this for 5 days straight, by theway. The next morning, transfer them allback to this connection to put itconnected to my laptop. I'm sick of it.And then I found out about KVM switches.It's this black box right here, right?There's a big button in the middle. Youput all your peripherals right here,which is your mouse, keyboard, and Ialso have my what's it called? My what'sit called? camera, my webcam that I justshowed you guys connected to this. So,it just automatically switches. So, whathappens is is as soon as I press thisbutton in the middle, it'll switch over.I press it again. Right now, it'sconnected to my laptop. So, this lightturns on and it'll switch over to mylaptop. If you're someone that worksfrom home and you have a work from homecomputer and you don't want and theydon't allow you to work from your PC,you need a KVM switch cuz changing theseconnections is ridiculous. And I'm overit. I was done. thing I got is I thinkeveryone has this speaker and I fellinto consumerism. I saw everyone on TikTok who had a cute little desk setuphave this speaker so I bought it. I onceI played music on it I was like waitthis is not loud cuz I was expectinglike a Beats pill type of um speaker.Yeah, you're not going to get that withthis. But it's pretty loud y'all. It isloud. It's pretty loud for if you'rejust trying to listen to music in yourroom. It is loud. I believe I got thisfor like $18.99. It was pretty good. Um,it does what I need it to do. So, I'mvery happy that I made this purchase.Also, if you haven't noticed already, mymonitor is purple. It's black on thefront, obviously, cuz that's the screen,but it is purple on the back. And Ithink that's the cutest thing in theworld. First of all, we could really getinto it because I love Pixio so much.They have so many colors and in myopinion is budget friendly consideringthat if you're trying to buy a pinkmonitor or white monitor in thiseconomy, that pink and white tax iscrazy. So, the fact that you can getpink, white, purple, blue, green withouthaving to be uh separated of price, likepink is not more expensive than purple.White is not more expensive than blue.Now, for my monitor arm, I love thismonitor arm down. I was lucky enough toget this as a sample from Tik Tok shop,and I love it so much. It actually comeswith two arms, but I took the other armoff because I'm not utilizing a doublemonitor setup right now. But, it's likea gas spring um monitor arm, so it'sreally nice. It goes up smoothly. Goesdown, goes up. And then if I wanted itto turn sideways, it can. Oop, you'refalling. You're falling up. And then ifI wanted to turn it back, it's like it'sit's really maneuverable. It's easy andI love it. It's my favorite thing in theworld. And yeah, she's all crooked now.I'm messing up my desk setup for youguys. So, I really hope that you guysleave a like, you subscribe, and leave acomment about what's your favorite thingabout my desk setup. Or you can just sayhi. And then obviously right here wehave my favorite mic in the world. Imean, I don't really have too manyexperience with other mics to decide onthis, but I got this mic for like $59 or$55, I think, cuz I got it on sale. Bestmic in the world. It's beautiful. I useit for my voiceover sometimes, and it'sreally good. Oh, and before I move on,forget this um mic arm was gifted to meby my boyfriend. I have no idea how muchhe spent on it, but I'm sure that youcould find one for maybe like $25 onAmazon. I also got this. This is for myphone for whenever I'm working. I put myphone on here and I play YouTube videoswhile I work. If I don't, I'm fallingasleep. That's just that's just how itis. So, I have to have something playingon my phone at all times. Here comes thelast few sections of my desk. It's veryclear. There's nothing here. Well,there's some stuff here, but let's getinto it. I like to keep my desk clearbecause I do have papers here sometimes.Sometimes I like to eat my food here.This is my work laptop. I bought a alaptop riser or something. I just put itright here just so when I do open up mylaptop, it's somewhat level with myscreen. It's not. It literally stopsright here. You get what you get and youdon't get upset. Um, this is my PS5controller with the skin that I boughtalso on Amazon. This is not a goodheadset. This headset is not good. Itleaks sound and the mic's alreadybroken. Don't know why. I've had it for2 weeks and it's broken. Got it fromAmazon. You're getting returned. I havethis little bear that my friend from mybook club Discord that got for me. Shecrocheted this together and it's thecutest thing in the world. I don't havea name. I don't have a name for her. Ifyou have a name I can name my cow, letme know. This is supposed to be a coffeeshop that I'm supposed to build, and Iclearly have not gotten back to it. Andthen there's down here, but we're notreally going to get into too much intoit. That's just a whole bunch ofmiscellaneous stuff. This area issupposed to be my content creation sidewhere I have my tripods and content ideanotebooks and peripherals or whatever Iwas going to store here. I'm too lazy toclean it, but one of these days I'mgoing to clean it. There's a videothat's going to come out about it. Downhere, this isn't actually supposed to bea foot stool. I just found it in myhouse and it's a foot stool. You willnever catch me at my desk without usingmy foot stool. I cannot and will not sitat my desk if there's nothing to hold myfoot. Down there is my PS5. Why? Cuzwhere in the world am I going to put myPS5? Nowhere. My PC is taking up thisside. Oh, there's my bed. It's quiteugly. Just ignore it. This is too shortto have this there. And I don't know ifI really I don't think I want to have myPlayStation just sitting right there. Imean, obviously not because I have mywork laptop here. Oh, how'd you fall,girl? Come on. Put you back up. Butyeah, so she's chilling down there.She's fine. She's She's, you know, she'sseparated from all the fun, but she'sgood. Okay, so we're back and that'severything that's on my desk. I swear toyou, I don't think I missed everythingthat's on my desk. The rest of my desk,I turned this into like a bookish shelfor whatever. I have Six of Crows righthere in the Crooked Kingdom. That's aduogy that's sitting right here. Andthen I have We Hunt the Flame and Leethe Stars. I have not read it, butpeople said it's going to be like my newfavorite book once I do read it. So, Ihave faith. Then I have the Cruel Princeseries, which is a trilogy, one of mymost favorite series ever. And then Ihave One Dark Window and Two CrisTwisted Crowns duology. Haven't read it,but I heard a lot of good reviews. Andthen I have The Monsters We Make byCorey X Kenchin. Cory Kenchin. Um Iactually have not read it. I actuallyjust have never gotten the time to readthis book. I will I will read it. I whatI wanted to do was make this into mymanga shelf, but then I realized howexpensive manga is. Um I do have sololeveling somewhere here. I think it'sright here, but yeah, I'm not going totake it down. So, until your girl canlike make some moola, if you want me tomake this into my manga show, subscribeand watch my videos. That's all you gotto do. Subscribe and watch my videos. Uphere, we have my like little pops orwhatever are my little action figures.This is Pochita from Chainsaw Man. Andthen I have the Black Clover cast, whichis Noel, Austa, and Yummy up theresomewhere. I have my passport righthere, too. That's not really smart.Don't do that. But I just don't knowwhere else I would put it withoutforgetting that it's there. Oh, I alsohave Panda from Juju Kaizen. Um, I alsodo have Zenitsu right here. He is a snowglobe. I got this from Five Below. Ithink this was like 350. Yeah, we gotZenitsu in a snow globe. Shake what helooks like. Real cute. Real cute. Thisis a daily planner that I bought that Idon't use. I bought this like 2 yearsago and I absolutely do not use it,unfortunately. I really should. It's anice planner. Like, it has priorities onit. It has a schedule from 6:00 a.m. to10:00 p.m., which honestly I likebecause your girl wants to start wakingup early. I literally wake up at 8:45a.m. every day. I want to start wakingup at like 7:00 a.m. or 7:30. And I wantthat to be the norm. Um, where I couldjust naturally wake up at 7:00 or 7:30,but like just have some time to myself.I have so much stuff going on in mylife. If I have some time before work,like me time, I could even maybe getback into reading cuz y'all know I'm ina reading slump for like 5 monthsalready. So, and then we have some extrastuff. So, I have like my uh like alittle mug right here, a candle. This ismy Bible that I got. This is the SheReads Truth Bible, the ChristianStandard Bible, and it has all thesethese labels of the books in the Bible.And she's so cute. I love it. Soaesthetic. Um I bring this to churchwith me every Sunday. Lastly, there's awhole bunch of stuff. I'm sorry. Justgive me a second. I have a trophy thatmy mom got me for when I was turning 21.It said, ""Congrats on adulting."" Andthen I got I have a painting that me andmy boyfriend painted. I have a poem thatmy boyfriend wrote for me right there.As you can see, I love my boyfriend alot and he loves me a lot, too. And thenI have this. I don't know what these arecalled, but this was gifted to me byChe. It's a Inside Out uh octopus. Realcute. Real cute. My essential oilsdiffuser. You guys want to see the PCand hear about it? Just give me asecond. Just give me a second. I swear.Just give me a second of your time and Iwill get to it just after this. And thenright here, I also have a little doorwhere I keep everything and anythingthat my boyfriend gives to me or that wedo together. He also got me this rosefor our three-year anniversary, and it'sone of my favorite book quotes ever. Hestalked my apparently, he stalked myTikTok, and he found a book quote that Ireally, really loved, and then he hadsomeone make it into a rose. It says, itsays, ""I was born into this world tolove you and I will love youin the next life and the one afterthat."" The cutest thing ever. Get you aboyfriend like mine. Actually, youprobably can't because I have him. Okay.Anyway, sorry. All right, I get it. Youhave literally been waiting for this thewhole video. You wanted to see the PCand how it came out, and this is how itcame out. It's the cutest PC I've everhad. Um, I actually didn't think it wasgoing to fully come out like this, andI'm very happy. You're probablywondering, Destiny, I thought you wanteda all white setup. I did, but rememberwhen I was talking earlier about thatwhite tax? Yeah. Mm- mm- When you wantto buy things white, it is so expensive.So, the two black things that I ended upgetting was the motherboard and then myGPU. I'm not mad at it. And it's reallynice. So, let me show you. This is thefront of the PC. I have a USBC, twoUSBs, and then a headphone jack. Andthis is my power button. My fans areright here. I have a total of six fans.I have two fans at the bottom righthere. Three fans on the side and then Ihave one fan in the back. And then yeah,this is what it looks like. It's socute. On the inside, I have Mikasa righthere on sitting on top of my GPU. I maybe a hypocrite. Um, I have Tony TonyChopper. Did I watch One Piece? Yes. Howmany episodes did I watch? 150. And thenI stopped. But I got to the point whereI met him and he I fell in love withhim. Can you be mad at me? Look how cutehe is. This is my GPU. Got these likelight up cord covers or whatever. It'sreally nice. I got them in the back,too. And then this is my favorite partof my PC. This is kind of what broughtmy PC together. I really recommend ifyou are not going the liquid coolingway, which I definitely recommend youdon't because like if you're buildingyour PC for the first time and you don'tknow what you're doing, you candefinitely damage your PC by installingthe installing the liquid cooler wrong.And then also it's more expensive. It'sthe second biggest and thickest piece inyour PC. And I did not want it to lookugly. But luckily, I found this uhcooler on eBay. Um cuz apparently it'snot made in the US. It's notmanufactured in the US. It's banned orwhatever. I bought this on eBaysecondhand. But this lights up. So I'mgoing to show you guys. But this lightsup. It tells me the temperature and it'sit's like a LED screen in there. It'sreally nice. And I'm going to show youright now. So let's turn this up.[Music]Okay, it's on. For some reason, it justloaded up really slow today. Uh, don'tknow why you're embarrassing me. This isat Celsius. I could also change it toFahrenheit if I wanted to, but Celsiusjust looks prettier. I want to see twonumbers, not three. It's my favoritepart, and it just brings everything inmy PC together. If my cooler did nothave a screen, I wouldn't love my PC asmuch. I would still love my PC cuz lookhow beautiful it is. But compare that tojust having a LD LED screen. It justlooks so much more high tech and it'snicer. What I spent on this PC, I may ormay have not used my financial aid, butthis is for school purposes. But I spent$1,500 on my PC. I got my CPU coolerused and then I got my GPU used. Um,very much a gamble on the GPU, but itworks fine. Um, I'm not having anyissues. I hate my chair so much. It isso flat to the point I have to buy thislike cushion. Usually end up putting thecushion down on the floor cuz I justhate it so much. This in general is soflat it hurts my butt. Pretty basicchair. There's nothing wrong with it. Imean, I'll live with it for now. It's aboneless chair. It hurts. I sit in itfor 8 hours a day longer sometimes cuzI'll just get off my computer for like 2hours, go to sleep, and get back on itcuz I want to play video games. So, Ijust love how this looks like a cubicle.Anyways, that's it for this video. Ifyou liked my desk tour and you want tosee more about me talking about my deskor my PC, if you want me to break downevery single thing that I got, cuz Iwill. I made a list. My boyfriend made alist and he can help me. He can be herein the video to do it as well. Um, I ama beginner. I am a beginner ateverything. I built this PC with him. Ijust helped him pass him the parts. Imaybe like put some PC parts together,but I didn't do everything. Oh, I forgotto show you. My boyfriend also got methis crochet um flower pot. Cutest thingever. I love it so much. And it'ssitting on my on my desk. Anyways, ifyou like this video, leave a like.Comment down below what you loved aboutmy desk or let me know if there'sanything else I could add. I feel likemy desk is pretty bland. I did forget toshow you that I have these um leaves upabove my desk. Only this part looksnice. The middle part keeps falling. Butanyways, yeah, that's basically it. I'llsee you guys in the next video. Bye.","What am I missing from my setup? I plan on adding more decorations! (P.S- Watch in 1.5x speed! It is more fun!)
Ma’am your the coolest person I know 🥹
The intro is so good you should do this more often
The desk glow up has been amazing to see, from not a damn thing to all this
“Your making me nervous” lmao your desk set up is so elite!!!
“ BECAUSE ITS MY BIRTHRIGHT TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE WALLLL!!”

I'm Jourdan, a silly goose who loves playing video games, exploring fantasy worlds, and hanging out with my cat, Riku. \n\nI also like mean blondes🌻","[Music]Hello and welcome to my gaming roomtour. My name is Jordan. If we haven'tmet before, hi. Hello. Nice to meet you.And if you do know who I am, you likelyrecognize the shelves behind me as Ifeature them in like all my content.I'll get questions about my gaming roomsetup, about my PC specs, and so Ithought it would just be fun to give youa full tour of my gaming setup. I willshow you how I maximize my space in hereand all the fun little trinkets that Ihave gathered over the years. I am quitethe maximalist if you can't tell. Allright, without further ado, let's get onwith the tour. Come along. Come along.Let's do this.Let's start our tour at the mostimportant part of any gaming room, thedesk. I use this Dell 34in widescreenmonitor that wasn't really meant forgaming, but I got it at a great price.I'm kind of a Logitech girl. I've gotthe MXM 3 mouse. I've got this lovelycreamy keyboard and the G735 headset.I've also been using this Logitech Bluemic for the past couple of years, and Ilove it. I think it's amazing. And Irecently just got a mic stand for itthat has really upped my audio. I tendto use a controller for a lot of mygaming. And Trolley sent me this reallyfunny controller stand that I've beenusing recently. I've got my KingdomHearts coaster and a bunch of littletrinkets that I keep on my desk likepens and hair clips by Mommy Dy. I lovethese. So, on to my PC build. I have anNZXT case. I needed it in white becausethat's my aesthetic. And I put all thesegoofy stickers on it from cons anddifferent things. I just love my littlestickers. This bad boy runs on an NvidiaRTX 4070 12 GB GPU and AMD Ryzen 7 5800CPU. We got the Corsair Liquid coolerand fans and the Corsair Vengeance Pro32 GB for memory. And it has a MSI B550Tomahawk motherboard. I also have awonderful Herman Miller Aaron chair thatmy dad stole from his office for me. Itliterally saves my back posture whileI'm gaming. Speaking of gaming, there isone game that I've been playing non-stoplately that I need to talk about. Ifinally started playing DisneyDreamlight Valley, and I've alreadyspent so many hours decorating myperfect little valley. There's trulynothing more nostalgic than building adream village alongside the Disney andPixar characters that I grew up with.You can farm, fish, decorate, go onquests for your favorite characters, andthere's even online multiplayer so youcan show off your valley to yourfriends. I love dressing up my littlecharacter. Look how dang cute he is. anddecorating my home and tending to mylittle garden. This is literally theepitome of cozy. This also felt like theperfect time to start playing sinceDisney Dream My Valley just released anew update with a new character andquests and they're dropping more contentevery few months. It's really theperfect game to jump in for a quick cozyreset or spend an entire afternoon within the most magical way. Thank you toDisney Dreamlight Valley for sponsoringthis video. I love your game. You canplay Disney Dreamlight Valley yourselfon PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and NintendoSwitch and get started on your valleytoday.Let me take you on a tour of my iconicshelves. They're my pride and joy, andI've just loved all the little thingsthat I've filled them with over the past2 years.The star of the show is my beautifulplant.Her name is Bulma. I think she'sbeautiful. I got her at a local plantstore here. And I don't know how I'vekept her alive all this time. I don'tknow. This is just kind of the the Lordof the Rings shelf. We have my beautifulpopcorn bucket. We also have KingTheodin's sword. I'm obsessed with thisthing, but I need to get a displayholder for the wall so I can like put upthere. How do you guys think that wouldbe nice? And then I'm sure all of youhave noticed this amazing Lego set. It'sthe Lord of the Rings ribbon bell that Ithink is just the most beautiful part ofthis entire room. This is a SailorMoonlight that I got on Amazon like twoand a half years ago. So hopefully thelisting is still up if you like it.These are Stein from Germany. Actuallyfrom Germany. And because this is abookshelf, I we I did put books on it.Um, so here are just some fun picturebooks and adventure books, differentlittle things I've either thrifted orbought over the years. And this is mydedicated Stardew Valley corner. I get alot of Stardew Valley things fromfriends as gifts and brands. So, we'vegot our little petty candle. And thisthis is a diarama made for me by GamerNostalgia. That's literally my characterthere. I love it so much.Got the cookbook, the guide book. I havea Stardew uh controller as well. Just mylittle my little shrine to one of myfave games. We've got a little trinketcorner under here with my prizedautograph from Deborah Wild from BaldersDay 3. So cute. And a picture of ShadowHeart um behind it that I need to getframed or put on a wall somewhere. Herewe have a speaker that I don't useenough and probably should, but it islike 10 or 15 years old, so you know,it's probably not as good as it could beanymore. And we got the Junimos from FanGamer. And then two absolute baddy iconsfrom animes. We've got Trunks and Toga.They're the baddies.Another book for the bookshelf. Somemore trinkets and books and things fromtravels and adventures. Then we haveeven more Legos. Legos are the best.More plushies, some of my faves, morebooks, and then a few more books just toround it all out. He's beautiful. Trulya masterpiece that I am so proud of. Ilove this bookshelf. It's so maximalist,but I that is my vibe for sure. And thenwe have the mini bookshelf that matchesthe big bookshelf um with just some morehellowith some more of the books I've beenreading recently and some vinyls. Andthen these are some cubbies that are somonstrously packed with all of mycosplay and sewing stuff. It is it's Iwill not be looking inside there. And wehave Riku.If you've seen my short form videos,you'll know that I I do this view a lotfor my filming. I'll set up my phonelike here and I'll do my acting.It's cuz it's straight onto the windows,so I get the best lighting, the naturallighting. You also get a lot of shotsfrom this angle, too, for the samereason. We'd love some good lighting andthe beautiful shelves in the background.Oh, and I can't forget to show thesecond full desk setup that I have inhere. This one's got a fun dark theme tocontrast the light of my setup. And it'salso rocking a Logitech mouse andkeyboard, plus an ROG monitor, and itdoes not have its own PC yet, but thatis on the wish list. Some final littledetails of the room. There are a bunchof swords everywhere. Um, a lot of mytrinkets kind of lying around. We've gotRiku's little bed, and probably some ofthe worst cable management you've everseen. Here's also a peek at what thesetups look like at night. I love theglow. I've been adding a lot of the RGBlighting in here recently and I justfeel like a real gamer when I'm in here.Plus, there's no overhead light, so Ikind of need these to see anything inthe dark. So, put all of that togetherand this is what you get. It is not thebiggest room, but it is what you do withthe space you have that counts. Andhonestly, this is like the coziest spacein the whole apartment, which isn't thatmuch bigger. And that is the end of ourtour. I hope you enjoyed this because Ireally did. Let me know what kind ofcontent you want to see from me next. Iappreciate you guys so much and hope tosee you in the next one. Subscribe ifyou want to. I love you. Goodbye.[Music]","You can join me in Disney Dreamlight Valley here: https://gmlft.co/DDV_JourdanGames_YouTube
Wow love all the Lego cars!! and Rivendell! ️
A game room is goals and this one is done well. Love the neon signs.
5:32 my dad actually has that exact same giant speaker, neither of us care that it isnt the highest quality audio, because he got it second hand, but it just looks so cool and that was enough of a reason for him to get it
dripped out white pc gang! love the setup dude
Well this was super fun! This channel is such great vibes.
Your smile is amazing, always makes me feel better
Oh I love this! 🩷🩷🩷 Nerd Room Tours are the best, just a collection of all that person’s most loved stories. That Devora Wilde autograph is awesome!
7:58 I want this neon lights
Love the cable management lol. Also the Gaymer sticker! Cute room :)
Finally got Stardew Valley (love it!)... I was super surprised to find I already played a game just like it last year called Palia. It's basically the same premise except abit more expanded on and all 3D and modern glow up graphics.. It doesn't quite hit the charm of old school sprites, but it is an MMO so that's cool. You should check it out!
This room gives off Xerneas .
Bless sweet fluffy Riku!
That sit up is so clean! Thank you for sharing, you have an amazing space that experiences yourself! Cozy space for sure!
Nice Kame island wallpaper on the monitor.
Legos truly are the best. You need more on display
Side lighting is the best.. overhead lighting is pure anxiety imo lol. Also those shelves are nice!
Happy Thursday Jourdan, I always enjoy your Stardew videos!!! Disney Dreamlight is one of my favorite games currently. I have 300 hours in the game, and my favorite charecters are Wall-E, Anna, Elsa, Remy and Mickey!!!
Sims, Stardew, Dreamlight and Fields of Mistria are the cozy games I enjoy! Great setup!!
I love your gaming room
El gato es lo mejor
looks cool
This is a dream room
Thats such a clean setup! Love the lego cars especially the little porsche 911 at the bottom
Thats a pretty cool mouse, I have a bunch of stickers on my pc too lmao
Ahhh I loved seeing everything in the room! Love your setup so much
You should play this game called vintage story it’s really good it’s like Minecraft but you can put a lot of more details and more realistic
I...I don't know how I got here, but I don't think I want to leave. I am just very confused?
Okay Jourdan
I've always loved your set up and style! So cute!
Loving the setup. Gonna have to take some inspiration from it for revamping mine.
Such a beautiful and fun set up ! I love how you arranged your bookcase (Hello Trunk from the future ! One of my childhood's crushes ) It's so cute how Riku (please correct my spelling if it's wrong) was staying in your arms, with his little paws on your arm, being rocked around. And congrats for the sponsorship !
Hello Riku!!
Nice room! Do you have a link to the display at 6:29?
Do you happen to know where you got your desk desk? I am using two tables put together, and it's miserable, lol. Your desk looks super spacious and nice! Also adorable kitty bed. I'm trying to find one for my cat Jester, and I might need to look into that one, haha. 

Cute video!
I'm lit sitting in that same chair in the smoke shack...
happy pride month ms jourdan!! love the setup :))
I like a nice and clean setup! I guess it's also your workspace, but man!... where do you keep all your mail and papers and stuff? XD That's what clutters my space.
W MAIN VIDEO JOURDAN
Hay Day the best Farm #HayDay
6:48 So you have chosen death.
Noice!!!!
I've got a desk, a computer... Yep that's about it :P

For real though that looks sick! :)
That must be an expensive apartment
cute
Everyone I know get their Herman Miller chairs by unconventional means
Nice! A little bit too bright for my taste, but as a streamer, you need the ""gud lite""!
What mic stand is this? I have the same and can't get the one I have to keep it in place. And if you like to get a similar plant, there is the Blue-star Fern (Phlebodium aureum), but I personally prefer the Kangaroo Paw Fern (zealandia pustulata).

For anyone interested, I have a chair from the same brand. Wait for a sale or get them refurbished. Better for your back then any gaming chair. Don't forget to move at least 30min a day and do basic back training. No back bain.
There must be technical issue here, I cannot find the OF link. Pls help !
You must be rich
I shudder to think what that apartment must cost.
What city is that?
It is really my dreaming corner! By the way, we have a game collaboration opportunity and sent email to you~
The Lego set is almost $700...
this comment refers to 1:37 in video. you must be very bussy person because of your nails ^^ Very nice setup :)
BBNO$ !??!
Yo like how gorgeous are you
1st
It's your boi, curlypop

This is the second time I have built a PC, my first PC build was over 15 years ago, so over time that PC could no longer play newer games, so it was time for a new build, since the old one was not salvageable. With this PC I can turn the graphics settings all the way up to ultra, even graphic resource hungry games such as Star Wars Outlaw, runs buttery smooth on ultra. Plus building with the HYTE Y70 was so easy, and PC started on the first boot without any issues, I was extremely overjoyed!

Then Iwas getting a black screen. The heightY70 with a screen kids.That is my case. It's a height by 70 andit has going to have a touchcreen whichI unboxed it for a YouTube video. Soit's right here with the accessories andthen all my PC parts. We'll have it alllisted down below in the description,but let's go ahead and start opening allthese parts, laying them out, and thenbuilding the PC. All right, so the firstthings first I'm going to be doing is mymotherboard. This is the motherboard Iwent for. Now, I did do um an unboxingbecause I took it out, so there'snothing in there, but I do need to stillget the cables that I left behind.First things first, I need to installthe CPU. Building this, I really wantedto build this for like gaming. That'sjust my priority is to make sure that Icould game and put my graphics on high.Um, there was not a lot of, I shouldsay, of these um, CPUs to choose from,but this one really looked like it hadgood specs, so I went for that one.Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music]I like to know is the CPU is actuallythe most like delicate thing to install.But why is it the most hardest? And Idon't mean like difficulty. I meant likeactually putting down pressure on thisand you have to gently put it on. Itseems like it's so delicate yet it's youhad to do too much to it. Also, it'sgood to save this because you never knowif you have to somehow warranty your CPUfor any kind of reason. If you're stilla new warranty and you need to put thisright back to protect the motherboard.All right, so next up is my RAMs. And Igot the RAMs from Ing Group with theseRAMs. And there's a 64 GB of RAMs.[Music]So, this is going to be my storage I'mgoing to be using. I'm going to be usinga 2TB from MSI. Now, the only thing isabout the storage. I feel like 2TB isstill not enough. Um, I feel like maybe4TB. I would love to get another SSD andso have like four, even more I'm finewith. Um, it just feels like because alot of my games are like 1 gig eachalmost. I have several games that arelike that. So, 2DB I feel like is goingto run out fast. But for now, this is mystarter. And then later on, I'll just goahead and upgrade and put another SSD inthere.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Music]Right.[Music]So, I got the this liquid cooler um fromMSI and it's the Mag Core Liquid E360in white.[Music]These hands are so pretty.Look at that. Oh, that looksI am super excited to see what thislooks like once I get this all hookedup.[Music]Is it?All right. I have to check and I need tosee if it has umthething with the name now.Uh let's see.Thermal paste. Once I saw it, I actuallyknew that what it's called.I was looking for this.That's good because I kind of wasworried. I was like, if I don't have theremote paste, I would have to go get it.And unfortunately, like my nearest myelectronic store is all closed right nowbecause it's night time. But thankgoodness they come with their own paste.And I'm kind of glad because I might asI rather use what comes with the actualcooler[Music]where the water cooler was actuallygoing to go. I'm just like lookingbecause I'm used to being able to takethis off and then just like install thisright into the water cooler, but I don'tknow how you take it out. I might haveto look at a video. The reason I can'ttake this top part out for my watercoloris because there's these two screwsright here. So that's why I couldn'ttake it out. So let me go ahead andunscrew that then.Heat. Heat. N.[Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]Heat.[Music]Heat.[Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]Jesus.[Music][Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music]I was a little confused actually when Ifirst turned it on. Like I was seeingall these like diagnostic like lightsgoing on and then I was getting a blackscreen and now I got the window screengoing on but getting a black screen andI didn't know what was going on but Ikind of forgot to hit delete button andto take me to the boot screen. Um, butthen I finally figured that out. Got itto boot screen and then I changed outthe priorities to boot from myto boot from my USB stick back here. Andnow it shows me my Windows prompts. Sonow I need to go install my Windows 11and get the drivers. Now this is notwhere I'm going to have my PC at becauseyou can see my monitors is currentlyoff. I have back there my um height Y60and I need to put my Y70 back thereinstead. But I didn't know if it wasgoing to boot or if I have to likediagnose more. So that's why I hooked itup to my secondary monitor. And then Ijust moved my keyboard and mouse. I hadto disconnect, as you can see down here,my height front panel because thatbecame my main monitor and it wasshowing me BIOS on this and I could notread like BIOS was super tiny. So Idisconnect that and now it's only on mymain.[Music]And this is the case I used. It's aheight by 70 with a screen kit. This isone of my favorite part of well one ofmy favorite parts because I have there'sso many parts like for instance thiskind of like kind of like look. I reallylove that because it reminds me of StarWars. Star Wars has those kind ofelements and so it gives me like areally Star Wars futuristic um vibe tothe case. But yeah, it's also atouchcreen and I really love it that youjust can move around and you can likejust play around with you can just movethis around and play around with thecase. It is like super cute. You can putlike any kind of widgets you want inhere. I have my media player. I havethese cute like emojis on here. Um, Ihave a chip that I put here is the GIF.I have my calculator. So, if you want tocalculate some numbers on here. Um, andthen of course my beginning just I alsohave here is my weather. I'll have myclock. It's kind of good to have myclock because it kind of keeps me ontrack and be like, ""Oh, it's kind ofgetting late."" Okay. Um, and then I alsothen I usually keep a GIF right here,but for now I took off the GIF because Ihave this wallpaper. But usually it'llbe a GIF depending on like what theme ofeither Star Wars or something else.[Music]So, you playing?Let me know in the comments down below.What is your favorite Final Fantasygame? It's definitely Final Fantasy 7.It's been the most longunning game thatI've been playing. It's such a longseries. It's definitely one of myfavorites and I can't wait to continueto keep playing.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]John says hope unfortunately it's findtime which I feel like he[Music]","Love the case. Final Fantasy 10 is my favorite. ️

And the first step is dealingwith this situation. Having your PC onthe floor is not as bad as people say itis, but it does make it harder for cablemanagement. So, we're just going toThere we go. Before I start pluggingstuff back in, let's make sure all thesecables are really necessary. Like thisone. Definitely not. Now, usually Iwould plug everything into a cheap powerstrip, but this time I decided to go forthis unit.I don't want to go too far because thesescrews are too long. They will gothrough the desk. I screwed into theside instead so I can mount the UPS likethat. This can keep the power on forlike 6 hours during an outage. It canprotect against surges. And from here,you can't even see it. Now thateverything is reorganized and pluggedback in, the last thing to do isactually hide the cables. Everythingback here just gets bundled and ziptied. And then just wrap them up in asleeve like this. Using some zip tiesand the screws that I screwed inearlier, I kind of suspended up thepower supplies like this. And then allof this gets zipped up, too. This mighthave taken me like 3 hours, but that'ssome of my best work right there.[Music]","For a very short 5 seconds I was so proud that no one commented “Carter do the thug shake” what a glorious 5 seconds

I will say, having gotten that same UPS, it won't quite last 6 hours with a gaming computer running on it. That capacity is more for shutting things down safely, which is still a huge boon if power goes out.
Subtle flex of the fold 7
that view is actually majestic asf ️
It will keep it running for 6 minutes not 6 hours, unless they figured out a way to put a powerwall 3 sized battery to this thing

Yo you make me want to get a pic set up which I wish I had can you tell me what I should get to play basic games like Fortnite PUBG and stuff like that plz plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzzzzz love your videos btw
Real ones remember his setup reviews, the old Carter would be appalled by that cable management
It’s funny to think there’s new subs who just assume Carter has always had one of the “retro outros”
smart....good outro

Eight hours gone by and Parker still didn't make a video about the Z Fold on his table...

Thats actually so clean
Cater, I know you probably wont see this but, I'm looking at XOTIC PC's and found a pc with a 5060, 15-13100F, MSI b760M Project Zero, 750W, 32GB ddr5 600mhz,, 1tb nvme ssd, 120mm rgb bk tower cooler, black fans with windows 11 home for $1,282.00 is it a good price? Or can I find something better? I really need help..
what's the name of the product?
Don’t forget Velcro ties next time instead of zip ties. Way easier to breakdown the setup later
I really wish more cables came in other colors than black.
Nobody talking about the z fold on his desk

And he's highkey beengriefing our CS games, so I figured itwas time to give him an upgrade. Ibaited the rest of the five stack andcoming to hang out by telling them we'dplay the latest AAA title. I'veaccumulated so many PC parts over theyears, and not all of them areaesthetic. So, those are the parts we'regiving to my friend, and I'm teachingChat how to build a PC today as well.Stick it in.Sticking it in. I'm shoving. We'regiving him an Intel 14700 K with anASRock Nova Z790 motherboard, 32 GB ofDDR5 Corsair Dominator RAM, a 1 TBTESamsung SSD, a 1000 W power supply, andthe Gigabyte 7900 XTX. That's all goingin the Thermaltch V270 case. This oneactually comes in Snow White, butremember, I took one apart to make theperfect matcha case. So, this one is theStormtrooper black and white leftovercase. I ended up working on the cablemanagement while Chad did the rest ofthe build just to make things go alittle bit faster. This is also my firsttime ever using the height thick Q60cooler. Oh this shit's heavy asThis is where I lowkey started gettingworried about whether everything wouldfit or not. And the top mount for thiscooler isn't ideal with the cablerouting, but it's literally impossibleto fit the GPU with this cooler in theside for this case. In terms of thecolor scheme, everything matchestogether so well, though. It only tookus 2 hours to build this PC, which ishonestly pretty impressive. We took abreak from Mario Kart to get all thedrivers and Windows installed. Andhere's what the PC looks like with allthe RGBs and the thick Q60 cooler LCDon. The LCD for this kind of looks likea phone. And you can change the face todisplay temps, but in this case, weuploaded a custom gift. My friend isliterally going from an Intel 7th gen toa 14th gen and his GPU was the 1080. Wealso brought some peripherals tocomplete the setup and then we went overto his house to help him set it up. Hehad this nasty super old Corsairkeyboard, so I thought it was fitting tobring him the K70 Pro, which is actuallyRapid Trigger, so it'll help him strafeCS. I don't even want to know whathappened on this mouse pad, but I gothim a new one from ESP Tiger with abunny on it. It's actually so cute andit kind of reminds me of his dog. And tocomplete the setup, I had to get him the10 mouse from Pulsar because it's only47 g. My boy better be hitting flicksacross the map with this. And here isthe final setup that has been officiallypimped out by PGE. Let me know what youguys think and fall for more aesthetictech reviews.","Crazy to have that build facing the wall
I’m still using an Intel 3rd gen i7. Your friend is so lucky to have you.
 I added a GTX1080 to it a few years ago. I used to have a GTX660.
Crazy nice looking build but all of that and ITS FACING THE WALLL GIVE THE PC RESPECT!!
That tissue box next to mousepad yeah we know what happened to his old mousepad
that was a THICK AIO damn
Update that bios if you haven’t already. Those cpus tend to explode and can take other components when it does.
The typa friend I need fr
He’s so lucky i’m still on the PS4
Arctic cooler got competition for radiators impossible to fit into cases now.
No way ur friends with the GOAT Chet, been a fan since his TSM coaching days
The only thing I can’t stand is the 1tb ssd, might as well go for the 2tb. I have a 2 and I’m already running out of space and I just built this setup
I love your channel and your content so so much i watch it almost everyday
I'm still using 
i5 3330
GT 710
8GB Ram
512 GB SSD .....

And I'm finally getting a new PC soon.
i5 12400f
RTX 3070
32 GB Ram
1TB Nvme

So excited man
I think sticking it in would be the best part of building the PC
Noo! Facing at the wall? Bro
Probably having issues intel instability issues if you have build new gaming pc so make sure check latest bios update versions if you don't update the bios will get it slowly cpu fried up when gets break the voltages caused by to disconnect pci express gpu any games loading to crash and pcie nvme m.2 will get bsod when loading the windows os and windows installer will get bsod so make sure return contect intel rma support or switch amd is recommended to finding the best ryzen x3d or x cpus
You sure thats just a friend
Don't forget to do a bios update for your 14700 K because the the Intel 13th and 14th generation processors have microcode issues make sure you update the bios and select the default Intel profile
Criminal to have the PC on the left like that 
Even tho it was a “parts bin” build it came out looking pretty sick
Is that condensation on his side panel, or just… a shit ton of dust?
The box of tissues. A man of culture I see
Wish i have friends like them who can donate parts for PC but also help and teach you how to build one too. Real friends
Make sure to do a bios update for the 14700k
To be honest, fitting the CPU Chip in the socket is the only thing I'm not confident about, else I can create any kind of pc I want. Its all like putting blocks together
7900xtx is a god gpu choice
Congratulations for the new pc setup.Can i have the old one
She is beautiful what a lucky guy to have a great friend to hook you up with a proper gaming rig.
i just upgraded from a 8th gen i9 to a 14th gen i9 and 50 gigs of Sims mods has never loaded so fast
make sure he got those microcode updates for that 14700k
That back fan better be an intake and the THICC cooler better be an exhaust cause Im gonna lose a shi- on that thermal performance
i hope such kind of freind spawns into my life also
We all need a friend like her
You got extra parts for me I’m trying to learn how to build a setup myself
Crazy upgrade, I’m still stuck with an i7 7700 and an RX480 4gb but will be switching to am4 with a 2060 soon
Teaching like a pro!
You hooked it uppp, I KNOW he's hyped
Holy he’s lucky to have you as a friend because you gave him some series top end parts
wish i had friends that gives me pc..
The fact they built it on carpet tells me all I need to know, will never be seeing one of your vids again
completely unrelated but what breed is the white dog (not the corgi on the pc the irl one)
Nice I’m still on i5 2050 2gb ram and intel hd 3000 graphics I genuinely don’t know how i’m still working on it
Should have went amd and the h6 flow case
Wish I had a PC your friend is lucky
Only 1 thing is bothering me. Those cables a cross GPU from the AIO
My boy got an aio with a display just to face it at the wall. Im fucking dead.
Your spare parts are better than mine hard earned parts lol
Friends in parallel universe
All that to keep it unseen.
That mousepad has been there for all the sessions and she just put a smile on it
probably he will replace the desk pad.
10k likes and she gives me decent free pc 

(note - i don't have any pc trust me)
“Stick it in, shove it in” she’s definitely said that to someone before in a different context
you said you’re giving him the ugly parts but that mobo is the most beautiful i’ve ever seen
Oh my that cooler is THICC
I need friends like you guys
Don't diss the 1080 the 1080 ti was goated
I believe rapid trigger is basically the same as snap tap and it is not allowed in cs2. Correct me if I’m wrong though.
i need friends like this
i really need the upgrade
How does she just have all this leftover new parts?
I need an upgrade I'm on a 10yo laptop over here
Why i don't have friend like you
so that's how your friends get you to give them a new pc? By being absolutely physically disgusting and griefing your games?
so jealous i had been saving up for a better gpu but bottleneck too big for cpu so now i am saving to replace both
Great video but the 14700K has huge problems with the voltages killing the CPU, extremely common problem with this CPU. I would definitely would change it out if you still can but if its too late the bare minimum i would do is BIOs update the motherboard so the voltages arent set so high. So the CPU wont die within the year. I would be extremely concerned for this cpu
Where can i get friends like these?
Dude, you're so lucky, I want a friend like that too
I wonder wheny friends will get a pc too
gpu sag goes crazy
If only i had friends like you
Intel in 2025 is diabolical
What a blessing, I hope he said thanks tech baddie when you were done.
Damn what great friends he has
Bro I need me some friends like these dam
I can make a use of that old setup plz
True Friends
TENZZZZZ MOUUUSSEE BABYYYY
WOULD LOOK BETTER IF THE AIO IS IN THE SIDES
TURN THE PC AROUND EVEN IF THE IO IS AT THE FRONT THAT THING IS NOT GOING TO FACE THE WALL
Yea if you could just teach my brother cable management my pc looks crazy but ion wanna touch anything
Loving that cooler
Ngl imagine the goat of VCT coaches ain’t even have a good ahh pc what is this man
Probably not the brightest idea to give this man a white case considering how much he takes care of it
7900xtx has a lot of stuttering issues
Need a friend like that lol
poor john caugt the smoke that effect is never not funny. It was perfect
No it facing the wall
i went from my gpu being the 590 to the 4070
That cooler is chunky its so distracting to me. Good build thou
Shows us how he doesn't take care of his setup or clean it and then you give him new expensive stuff??? Crazy work in my opinion
How did he survive with that mouse pad my nose would kill me
It's a shame that beautiful build is sitting on that side of the desk so you can't even look at it
250 dollar cooler is crazy
I need a friend like you shiiiii
Why does he have tissues on his desk
I also wants friends like u
pretty nice build just needs more storage 1TB is a small drive
Can you please build me a setup I play on a 6 year old switch and I really need a upgrade please
I'm curious about why you went with intel for the CPU when AMD objectively has better value.
Thanks for not putting the pc on the floor.
wild to see chet here like (coming off valorant videos)
I'm sTiCkInG iT In
never thought i see chet in video building video
bro the 1080 is actually good
Here for tech reviews, also admiring the nails so pretty
Bro Why don't I have friends like you .
the cooler was THICC, just like........
Yo I thought you were Fuslie for a second.
And remember if just wanna play games just us a ryzen 7 7800X3D and even for multi tasking is really good
The ram is worth more than my pc build (budget baller)
HOW DO YOU HAVE A 14700K LYING AROUND?
You have got no exhaust fans flip the AIOs fans to exhaust
I want friend like you. Please make for me one
I jave the matcha green 270. Still buying all the stuff to go inside. Lol Gpu this on july 18th. 9070 xt 16 gb in white or silver

Wish I had friends like you lol my setup is so much more sad than his lol
At lest you punished him with intel
How do you have so much extra parts laying around ?
I use a Aio computer It used to be my father's, my father got it from his father and he has I3 5 gen 4 gb ddrl3 intel uhd and 720p screen

What the fuck is chet doing here, his a valorant international title winner coach whaaaaat, also bro that setup u just gifted is crazy, I wish I had someone gimme that
I need friends like that
Where’s my upgrade at
If he had a 1080 anything else will be a downgrade
woah a 1080 is nasty?! I got a 1660 Super bruuhhh
Damn, and I thought my setup was dirty for having a thin layer of dust, cat hair, and the odd crumbs
Talk about an upgrade holy shit
chet be just doing stuff nowadays
Can I have the same set up :D
Why buy such an expensive aio if you're not able to see it?
Are you trying to tell us you're on the market?
Chet Singh my goat
WAIT COACH CHET?!!

But right now, the monitor isonly running at 60 Hz, which is not fastenough. You need to have peakperformance gaming on here, even withthe free PC. I kind of forgot the HDMIcable to support a different refreshrate. So, I need to find another one.Okay, I just found another one. Andunfortunately, it is somehow broken. Allright, new day, new cable. And this oneactually claims to be high speed. So,let's see if I can actually turn up therefresh rate. Nope, it's still 60 Hz.I'm trying to update the drivers, butthe Wi-Fi is so slow. It's literally 700kilobytes a second. All right, itfinally downloaded. Let's see if it doesanything. What about now? Let's see. 60Hz. It's still 60 Hz. Yeah, I have noidea. I'm temporarily giving up. Allright, I figured it out. It's the minidisplay port to HDMI adapter. It onlysupports 1080p 60 Hz. Luckily, I have adifferent one that may or may not workbetter. We are still stuck in 60 Hz.","use displayport, displayport is how most people get all their hertz
It also depends on the hdmi version.
It’s got to be indeedly that adapter you got it’s actually limiting the refresh rate to 60 hz only
It depends on your monitor too.
A lot of monitors you gotta lower the resolution to get higher refresh rates (especially CRTS and Gaming monitors)
i get 75hz over DVI and dvi to hdmi adapters so it's not the generation for lower high refresh rates
That 700 kbs is my average internet speed
check if your graphics card can even handle 100hz. if it does, then get a new 100hz miniDP-hdmi adapter.
My average internet speed is 700kb
I don’t even know if that monitor can handle any more than 60hz. That thing looks like a budget friendly off-brand office pc. I’d be surprised if it does anymore than 75hz at most.
if displayport doesnt work use CRU you can add your own HZ options just dont go too high or else your monitor will break (restart needed to add the option)
There’s three dependency’s for “high” refresh rate you need to make sure the plug on the monitor supports it same with the actual cable and the gpu plug itself if one of the three components doesn’t support it, it’s not going to work
I like how this guy never give up
Disable any and all power efficiency modes, G-Sync/FreeSync settings, ELMB options. Then check your refresh rate options once again.

Install ViewSonic INF drivers.

For further troubleshooting, please respond to this comment with your specifications. All I need additional info on is; Monitor, GPU, motherboard, CPU, HDMI Version, Windows version.
having a lower resolution will sometimes allow you to have a higher refresh rate, maybe give that a try?
Integrated graphics sometimes has Hz limit like 1080p 60hz even tho ur monitor may be 1080p 100hz you can try to add a different gpu and see if it works
It could be the port on the PC because it's a pretty old one
Amd's FSR can also cap you at 60hz. Turn that off
Use CRU and just make sure to remain in the cable bandwidth limits
Overclock your screen
I also noticed you have an adapter....that is not going to work, just plug it straight into the gpu...if your gpu doesnt have HDMI it doesnt support high refresh rates
The port itself is probably limited the GPU might not be powerful enough to run that refresh rate
what about the monitor menu you can overclock it to turn up the refresh rate
Your monitor refresh rate can also interfere with that
Bro that pc looks like from 2010 might be the reason why you are not getting high refresh rates
When a monitor won't go over 60Hz, just download the monitor's driver and install that which gonna let Windows know the actual capabilities of the connected monitor.
1 Monitor might just be 60, 2 the monitor might have a low spec hdmi and high spec dp.
The port on monitor may only do 60hz or the port on pc
Lower the screen res and you will get faster screen refresh rate.
Yeah but the gpu may not support highter refresh rates
Try setting it with CRU
You might wanna change the monitor and/or use an HDMI version that supports that monitor.
The GPU simply doesn't have a good enough HDMI version for it...
Check if the GPU's mDP version can handle high refresh rates. If it does, get a mDP-HDMI adapter that supports 100Hz or more.
try the CRU which some gamers use for overclocking monitor resolutions
If its going throw a converter most of them won't let it go higher then it can
It might even be in the port, or since this is a ""free pc"", it might be the gpu
It may be the port on the mother board
Use custom resolution utility
Its the cpu, since its an old cpu it does not support higher refresh rates
It could be the port on the monitor, try using a displayport cable if possible
Some monitors only have their maximum refresh rate if you use display port same thing happened to me and I switched to DisplayPort
it depends on the resolution
Ion think thats a cable problem brotha
GPU needs to support 100hz, monitor needs to aswell, HDMI Version may be off, or just use displayport.
60 hz monitor?
700kb ain’t that slow for me
It’s likely the motherboard stopping it from reaching
Does the monitor even support more than 60Hz???
You got to put the monitor at a 45° angle, remember a²+b²=c²?
Just get an Vga Cable It Supports upto 180hz
Go in amd software and click in custom resolution and change 60 to 100
It is because of mini dp to hdmi that you get only 60hz
the monitor: Hi i'm 60hz
It weird that it only outputs 60hz im guessing its the adapter or the driver missing for the monitor I did saw viewsonic website having some for their monitors. My old rx550 had dvi and I used a DVI to hdmi cable and did get 75hz on my old monitor.
It might be possible for you to overclock the monitor. I went from 60hz on my laptop to 95hz
Maybe the PC just cant do 60 hertz cause the hdmi port version is too old
it's probably since the gpu sucks, so it can't output more than 60hz
You should take down the resolution,to 900p or 720p,and then you should be able to set it to 75hz.
Use CRU = Custom resolution utility

Because with it being socompact, you know, you can have justeverything plugged into the back ofhere, external monitor out, and nowcontrol your entire laptop setup justfrom this tiny little hub. But ofcourse, it's not just for the laptop.You can use it with your gaming setup aswell.

SHLEERP CHILL
Love how the outro was the nostalgic kind
Shleerp will be put to rest hopefully
Shleerp wilding out
THANK YOU! FINALLY THE OUTRO IS BACK
can you set it for keybinds in games or make it press keys? it would be super useful for setting keybinds
bro got that Eyestream 2019 ahh intro
FIRE OUTRO
The outro
I have a loupdeck live s for music and discord controls
They use those at the Virtual Production Stage I worked at (they're all gamers so it now makes so muuuuch sense!)
Scream deck!
I xlicked rhinking that this was about the steam deck
Please add a thug shake button
Why you need copy and paste when you have Ctrl + C Ctrl + X Ctrl + V
A video about srtups and pcs? thats new
My point is the liquif glass is the best ui choice they have ever made
A door dash button is peak bigback technology
at this point its just ragebait
Dad got me a stream deck for my birthday without asking. W
I am running A Gtx 1060 3GB build cant even play gta or literally anything without it Lagging and I can't really get a new build because im in Germany and everything is a bit more expensive here and since i don't have money i cant get a new one
Instructions unclear, now I have a STEAM Deck
I almost cried when Shleerp said ""thugtro""
Shleerp is goated
THE OUTRO GOES HARD!!!!
Carter try to make a gaming pc for 2000 dollars budget but that you can keep for at least 5 years
Why can't you just have the same GOOD quality for all your videos
Having doordash as an option is the most big back thing I've seen
I can't be the only one here just for the outro and not for the video itself
love the outro btw
THANK YOU FOR THE OUTRO
SHLEERP Is back again
I never thought a steam deck would be that useful.
THE OUTRO IS BACK
i use a remapped number pad - (i use HID macros for remapping and 3d print labelled button covers for it, works well)
2nd Worst take you ever did tbh button for door dash lol
“What’s wrong honey, you asked for a Stream Deck?”
Shleerp already comment four times
I use my stream deck mk. 2 for programming, and it also works as a digital photo frame when not in use
The cable is detachable. I’ve had the small one that only has like 12 buttons.
When a non removeable cord breaks, I replace it
Rare instance of Carter not glazing apple If only there was an Apple streamdeck
the fact that he randomly discovered something in this thing while making the vid is funny af ngl
Yo Carter, is that a button to a spicy site there? My guy has the gooner button on lock
""The whole thing was bricked""
My brother in christ........ solder.
we need a button on the stream deck to show carter doing the thug shake
The outros back
That outro was very important. Thank you.
I use it mainly to mute and deafen on TS and Discord and also for my soundboard
Why the slop content
Elgato released virtual stream deck software any screen can now be a macro pad.
We both know we saw THAT Carter
Cool but can you put the thug shake on it?
Beautiful outro
Shleerp is NOT taking this summer off
I dont hate carter tho i want to make that clear
And they got VSD on 7.0 beta. Very huge W
that outro used to be my youtube channel intro in like 2018
Slheerp is so majestic
don’t think we didn’t see that shortcut “carter”
I always here “steam deck” instead of “stream deck”
Shleerp didnt notice Pizza Hub
For that people: "" where's button??!!!""
Liquid glass is soo underrated
Imma just use it as a soundboard dawg
wasn't gonna like until the outro came in
Never lost the outro, the last couple of videos have been re-uploaded
The stream deck keeping you big as hell
Now I’m just watching for the outros
We got the outta back it's so majestic
Windows ai button on a laptop 
Stream deck with an chatgpt button
U need the one with the knobs, it’s sm better
Banger outtro
Welcome back Shleerp
Bro acts like its alien technology
I think it’s easier to hit control + c and then control + v than to reach and press the stream deck buttons
The stream deck ist good but it’s really expensive
The last used emojis are freaky as hell
Can I have the dji mic 2s please day 413
OUTROOOO YEAH!!!
wait until he finds out what a bookmark is
I got the mini and it's a great media controller as well
Copy, paste, chatgpt, YouTube, visual studio, unity, git hub, undo, redo, zoom in,zoom out, change window, back to desktop, open file explorer (on windows), open browser
All that and I may still have more buttons to use ngl
Yesss stream deckkk review
Pizza Hub lol
I thought he meant Steam deck and I now spent 650 dollars on it.
Bro cant last a day without breaking a device
I need for school
outro button on the deck
Nice outro
Bro doesnt need to tell his opinions if they suck tho
Fuck it i might buy this when upgrading my laptop
That is the most Carter thing I've ever seen you do
So... A taskbar️
Must’ve been the wind
I need that only for food
Did no one see the pizza hut one
I’m begging for a Mr. who’s the boss Collab
The outro is stupid too lioe its there just to make people talk about it slop content
Dolrdash is easily carters weak point
I literally just use it as a taskbar
Pizza hub is crazy
Chat gpt cuz he cant do anu amoumt of research
Yo Carter, gotta do an outro that's just the invincible title card
Wait till he finds out abt keyboard shortcuts
Did no-one see the shleerp button?!
D
I heard you could turn a number pad into a stream deck
pizza hub got me
the fact that it says ""Pizza Hub"" and not ""Cornhub""
So real
WHY DO WE NEED A BUTTON FOR THE HUB
Shleerp chill ️
My dad works from home and has two in his setup. Half of his buttons are ip addresses
Why is nobody talking about the pornhub button
Okay thats actually really good
The sheer amount of laziness
And now it's a business expenses
Carter is such a big back having DoorDash
Carter putting his pc on the floor while it's sucking up all that delicious dust
respect to the guy who commented (multiple times) on his comments
Outros are backkkkk
Using that takes longer than just pressing ctrl c bro
There was PHub button in last row
Most expensive app buttons ever...
INTRO IS BACK
WHYS NOBODY TALKING BOUT THE PH ICON
Linux users:
Look what they need to mimic the fraction of our power
Just gonna quietly add ""Pizza Hub"" to my streamdeck and call it a day.
Yeah, just ignore the pizza button
The outrooooo
""iOS 26 gonna be crazy"" - carterpcs 2025
I cannot tell how much i despise carters opinions
Ok, I am buying one today
Shleerp commenters keeping Shleerp big as hell who is keeping you big as hell
Theyre so god damn expensive though.
you even got a pizza hub button, that's so cool
Why do you need a dedicated file explorer button when win+e exists as a shortcut
Macro deck is free and you only need your PC and phone to use it.
Are we all gonna ignore the pºrnhub button on the deck
the outro
The outro
Would you not place the bed on the left of the door and place a devider between them?
AW HELL NAH PIZZAHUB???
You can use your phone as a stream deck
People use it for flight sims
Sheerp is crashing out again…
Star Citizen or other games like that with a shit ton of keybinds
Bro doordash
I think shleerp is a little too obsessed with Carter
GIVE BRO HIS LAPTOP
Or just set up macros
You can literally do all of that. For free with your phone.
I got that same outro but i use it for an intro
Stream deck + is better. Has knobs and you can just slide infinite times to different scenes
WEE NEEED THEEE OUTROOO
Cater instead of useing crtl x and v
I always hear steam deck :sob:
you can just use numpad or win+e
yes
HOLY SHIT NO ONE SAW 
THE HUB 0:24
INTRO NOW CARTER I DEMAND IT
When is our king getting his pc
To copy and paste is the stupidest use of it just use your keyboard shortcut. It’s not that hard.
Keep the outrooooo!!!!
doesnt he already have a footrest thing for doordash
bro added an outro to make the vidoes a couple seconds longer
Didn’t u have a stream deck plus as well?? I have one it’s great
So nobody else noticed that?
there’s a button no ones talking about
I don’t know why but I want one cuz it’s techy
OUTROS BACCKK
THW OUTRO IS BACK!
If you actually understand something about tech you could change the cable
GIVE HIM LAPTOP
i thought he was saying steam deck for half the video
day 2 of asking carter to do the thug shake
AHHHHH WHICH YOUTUBERS OUTRO IS THIS!? I swore I watched his vids
Just buy a mini monitor that has a touch screen it cost $50
What is Shleerp on?!?!?
setup tour pls
OUTRO JEHY
Stream deck + is sooooo good for me. Allows my ancient at2020 to sound crisp, and I can soundboard my friends. The soundboarding alone was worth the money
Bro is so lazy that he cant even open a site to order food
Why is no one talking about the PH button
Pizza hub
I saw that Carter.
File explorer!?!?! People who use WINDOWS + E
What button gives us the Carter thug shake
make a outro button
this is what i used the apple touchbar bor
Why?
So how customizable is this? Could I run midi signals through it? Could I use it to trigger effects in let's say ableton live?
SHLEERP CHILL
Carter you should make and sell your own keyboard, maybe do a collab
YESSSSS
its an intro outro
bro cant even tyoe shortcuts on a keyboard he needs seeprate buttons like a child
Under 1 min gang
bro discovered macros
Just assign a shortcut
Did I see the hub???
bro so lazy not only does he use chatgpt but he has a dedicated button to bring it up instead of just looking it up not only that but A DEDICATED DOORDASH BUTTON TOO
you can also get another keyboard
Buddy is too lazy to hit 3 buttons so instead he hits one to copy or paste

And as you can see here,this desk features quite a few lightshere. And they do have a purpose. So,they are able to correspond to a game uhwhich we're going to test that outafter. And uh also, we got a light inthe front here on the sides as well. Anduh as you can see here, I have all thecables on the floor. So, I'm going tohave to hide all those cables insidehere. The other thing is you can see Ihave my monitor mounted to the wallhere. And the reason why I did that ismy previous desk was a little bitwobbly. But this one like at the lowestsetting here,it's it's not really moving at all.Taking a look at the right hand sidehere, we got the up and down. Also, weare able to set two memories here aswell. And then we have a little displayhere that displays the how high thetable is right now. So, at its lowest,it's 28 in. And uh I've gone ahead andset memory 2 so it goes to the highestpoint here.Not sure why you would need it thishigh, but it does go all the way to 53in here. And for any reason you're gonnahave the desk this high and you want tosee if it's wobbly, there's a little bitof a wobble to it, but not too crazy.Like as you can see here, I'm able todefinitely move it around, but when it'sat the midpoint or the lowest point,definitely there's like no moving thisdesk. And moving up and down is a verysmooth operation. And the motor is veryquiet, which is good. So whenever you'reputting the desk up and down and it'snot going to make like any huge uh noisethere. So right now like at around 33inches here there's really no wobblejust like a bit like right now I'm likereally pushing this desk hard. It's notlike moving around which is good. And ifyou're going to leave it at the lowestpoint uh which most people I think aregoing to do anyways if you're sitting ona chair definitely very sturdy. Like ifyou're moving your mouse doesn't matterhow hard you're moving your hand aroundit's not going to really move the tablewhich is good. And the chair like fitsgood. like the armrests here gounderneath as well. Uh there's thispiece of metal that's holdingeverything, but it doesn't really get inthe way of the armrest here, which isgood. On the left hand side here, wehave a few more buttons. So, we got theQ1, Q2, and Q3 here. And then you'reable to go ahead and choose a fewdifferent colors. So, you got the allthe like solid colors. And then we alsohave the rainbow color as well. Andthen, uh we got Q2, which controls theside light here. You can go ahead andcircle the colors here or set up therainbow color. And the Q3 are these kindof like side lights here. And these aremagnetic. So you're able like to goahead and circle the colors here. So onething is we are able to go ahead and uhcontrol these lights. So we got a USBcable here which we're going to testthat out after. Taking a look at themeasurements here. And the length hereis 150 cm. Checking out the depth hereis around 69 12 cm. So right now I'mgoing to go ahead and organize all thecables. Also the PC that you see therethat's uh around 30 kg more than 60 lbthere. So that thing is definitely veryheavy and which is going to go on theside there. And I'm going to go aheadand put all the cables inside here.We're going to see how well it hideseverything. The other thing which I wantto go ahead and cover before I puteverything together here is this leatherdesk mat. And it does cover the wholedesk here except the portion where youlift this up for the cables. And uhunderneath it is kind of like a magnetbecause the whole base here of the deskis metal. And here we got this uh niceuh leather with a nice stitching on theends here. You can easily like just uhtake it off if you want to cleananything and then uh just put it backon. And on the right hand side here, wegot the black light logo with thestitching. So, I got the desk all sethere. Everything on top like I usuallyhave. So, the PC, the speaker, thekeyboard, everything is in here. And uhoverall, there's a nice clean look herenow. And uh the RGB here. I thought Iwouldn't really like it so much to haveall this uh RGB around, but actually itlooks good. As you can see here, it hasthis nice clean look. And if I want togo ahead and just like switch out thecolors to this one here, I can go aheadand do that. Uh there's no adjustingbrightness from this controller here.But if we go ahead and install the app,which I'm going to show you in a second,we are able to go ahead and uh modifythese lights quite a bit. Also, in game,we are able like to set this up, whichI'm going to show you shortly. So,probably you can already notice herewith the amount of cables that we hadbefore. Right now, everything is hidingin the desk here. Here's the results.Pretty much I only have the power cablethere and just two cables going to thesubwoofer there. Pretty much that's it.Everything else is kind of on the deskright now. Since I have this hugesoundbar here, I decided to put it atthe end here, which fits perfectly anddoesn't move, which is nice. And uh herewe have all the where the cables arepretty much. I have a power bar herewhich is powering everything frommonitor to PC. Here you can see all thecables. Uh so I do have a power bar. Soeverything is plugged in through thereand then I just have uh one going to theoutlet and all the USB cables andeverything is in here. And uh here's acloser look at underneath here. So allthe cables are pretty much hidden here.So nothing is in the way. So just thatone power cable there and that's it. Sochecking out the legs here. They aremetal. So I have a magnet here and uheverything seems very solid all around.And uh just checking the width and depthhere. So around 6 1/2 cm with uh 9 1/2cm. So the max load you can have on thistable is 125 kg or 275 lb. And uhalready this uh PC alone is over 60 lb.And then we got the speaker here. Uh theonly thing that's not attached rightnow, I still have the monitor attachedto the wall. That's how I had itpreviously. So the good thing is thetable still stays in place here. Itdoesn't really move around. Even thoughI have like heavy on the right hand sidehere, it still stays pretty strong. Iknow I have it at the lowest point, butif I were to raise it higher, obviouslythere's going to be more wobble. But atits lowest point here, it doesn'twobble, which is nice. Checking out thecontrollers here. We are able to goahead and set a preset. So, we have oneor two. And uh this is the displayyou're getting when you're moving thetable lower or higher. So, if I was togo ahead and go to the lowest preset, Ihave that on memory. And for any reasonyou don't want uh only you to touch thetable or if you have any kids, you don'twant them to like kind of put the tableat the highest point, you can go aheadand lock the whole controller here. So,if you want to go ahead and hold the Sfor 13 seconds, around 13 seconds, andthen uh we'll see a lock here. And tounlock, just go ahead and hold the S for8 seconds, and then it will unlockeverything. And on the left hand side,this is where we have the controllersfor the lighting for the side and thefront here. So, we have three of them.Uh this one is a separate light, too.So, for the first one here, if you wantto go ahead and hold it, it will turn itoff. And then we got the second onewhich is on the side here. Turns it off.And then the third one which is this onehere. And to go ahead and turn it on,just press it once and that's it. Andyou're able to cycle through all thedifferent colors here as well. So I dohave the table all plugged in via USBcable. And uh you will need to go aheadand download the app which is for somereason 5.6 GB. I am not sure why itneeds to be so big. Um it does installthese Nvidia drivers, a few things likethat. So going to the desk option firsthere. Uh we can see here the light isonline but lift is offline. I tried toinstall the driver once again but thisdid not work. Hopefully in a futurefirmware update they'll uh be able tofix this because this is good because uhnot many other desks really have thisoption. The cool thing about this isyou're able to use this with a timer. Soyou're able to set this to whatever timeto go at this height and then to godown. So going to the lighting here, weare able to control the brightness hereas well. And uh the brightness can go aslow as uh like 1% here. So it's a verysubtle. So if you would if you're likeplaying a game, you don't want thelights to kind of hit your eyes oranything like that. So you can set it aslow as 1% if you wanted to. But I foundit like around like 10 or 20%, it'sokay. it doesn't really bother you evenif you go ahead and play any game. Soright here we are able to go ahead andswitch off uh any of the LEDs. So thefront one if I wanted to the side onesas well. So you're able to controleverything from here. And then we gotsome scenes here as well. So if I gocompetitive so it kind of cycles thecolors all around which is pretty cool.And then leisure here. That's anotherscene. Office.And then there's this good morning. Theone thing you can notice uh what theydid with the RGB strips here only likeone RGB lights up at a time which isgreat. That's kind of more of a premiumRGB lighting. Probably you've seen thoseuh other RGB strips like three at a timelight on which doesn't look smooth buthere you can see like how smootheverything just flows. It looks prettygood. Next jumping to the home sectionhere. Uh the other cool thing is uh soif I go ahead and click screen here andstart that. So, anything I show on myscreen is going to kind of you'll seethe colors matching. So, if I go aheadand just play this video here,as you can see, it kind of like matcheswhatever is playing there. And then, uh,we're also able to go ahead and do formusic as well. So, I just have somemusic playing and it's going by thesound.So, now let's go ahead and uh start thegaming one here. And I do have Valerantinstalled already. Uh there's a fewgames that are supported right now. Soyou can see Counterstrike 2, League ofLegends, and a few other games here. Andwe can see here the Valerant is runninghere. So it should open up prettyshortly. And as you can see, the lightsare already taking an effect to Sowhatever we're seeing on the screenhere.Welcome to basic training. Jet, come on.Put on. No. So, looking at Valeranthere, I think it makes it more immersiveif you're playing this game. Especially,I think if you're going to be playing asingle player game and having thelighting go around, it's going to bemore immersive uh rather than amultiplayer game because you don't wantkind of like lights going in your eyesand all that. But, uh you have thatoption if you want to go ahead and turnoff one of the lights in the front orjust leave the side ones. So, one thingto keep in mind is if you're going to beusing one of these scenes, uh, as soonas you close the app, if you go aheadand exit the app, it's going to go aheadand, uh, revert to the default just likeas you would, uh, turn the colors onfrom here from the switches. So, rightnow, looking at the resources this appis using is 0.4%CPU and uh, one gig of memory. Hopefullyin the future they'll go ahead and uhmodify this app a little bit to make ita little bit less uh demanding on thememory, but uh right now it's 0.5 to and1 gig of memory, which is a bit high. Sothere's a few things this table hasgoing for it. So we got the magnetic tophere, which makes the whole desk kind offeel uh premium. Um and then thelighting here looks good. It's not likejust a gimmick or anything like that.And uh I wish it had a LED like at theback as well. It would have beenactually good. I would have actuallypreferred more to have like the LEDstrip at the back rather than the fronthere. That's just me, but I think itwould have made more sense that way. So,this table has MDF and it's wrapped withmetal here. Very sturdy all around. Itdoes have this whole piece of metal inthe front here. So, nothing is reallyever going to bend or feel like it'sbending or anything like that, which isnice. So everything is going to remainnice and flat. The thing which I wouldhave loved to see this desk have is kindof adjust the scenes like maybe from asmartphone app uh rather than installingsomething on your PC because usually Idon't really like installing things onmy PC any especially this 5.6 gig ofthings in there and then leaving it openon the background while playing a gameand it's taking up memory and all that.So, but if you want to get more immersedand have all the colors kind of likewhat while you're playing a game. So, ifif you prefer something like that, thishas that option. But personally, I wouldhave loved just to have an app on myphone and just to control just to havemore scenes and brightness and all thatbecause you're not really able tocontrol the brightness straight from thecontrollers here. And looking at theassembly, you're getting one huge box,uh, just the table itself, and then asmaller box with the legs, but you willneed to have two people in order to setthis up. If you're by yourself and tryto set this table up, you're definitelygoing to struggle a lot. So, just keepthat in mind. The good thing about theassembly portion is the legs. You canjust go ahead and uh, put them on. Noscrews or anything like that, which isnice. The only screws that you reallyneed is just to put the base on thelegs. Pretty much that's it. And you'redone. No more screws anywhere else,which is nice. So, assembly was great,but you will need two people when youwhen it comes time to lifting andflipping the table around. Really hopeyou enjoyed watching this video. If youhave any questions about this tablehere, go ahead and leave a commentbelow. I'll be more than happy to answerit. And I'll see you on the next one.","I thought I would share this with you, as I experienced the same thing regarding the lift control through the software. I reached out to Blacklyte, and an expansion dock is a necessary new part introduced after a recent software update. The expansion dock as they explained it "" is a small plug-in part that connects to the control box and allows the software to communicate properly with the motor system"". After they were able to confirm that, they let me know that they will ship two expansion docks to me, since my second (work) desk will be delivered tomorrow. For me, it will take anywhere from 5 to 10 days to get the docks, but well worth it, since this is a feature not many other desks have.
Would this desk accommodate an under desk pc mount? And does it look like it would handle a dual screen monitor arm or if need be 2 separate arms? Im assuming the arm would mount between the main desk surface and the compartment door at the rear similar to the way the magnus desk is set up?

Forget the mouse. Where did you get that awesome desk mat?
Respect to that guy who said respect to that guy who said ' respect to that guy that claimed it ' Please dont repeat
Fun fact you can use mouse and keyboard on a Xbox
8bitdo makes some really quality stuff, their wireless controller is $40, feels premium, comes with a charging dock, and has hall effect joysticks, i cannot stress how good it is.
8-bit do makes awesome products i own 3 of their controllers they are super good
Are those side buttons on there?
That cable looks sick
Halo 2 control I used to have would gone perfectly with that
Apple's taking notes

Respect to the guy who said respect to the guy who said respect to the guy who claimed it
I read the reviews on amazon and they all have the same complaint that the side buttons are not that great and the mouse wheel is squishy.
Looks like half of a banshee in design
Respect to the guy who gave respect to the guy who claimed it
>retro
>optical
Got it

No one tried because they assumed others faster
I claimed it
WOW LOL NICE
Prime example of why xbox is bleeding money. Mfs giving away gamepass like they aint gotta eat the cost
Everything comes with games pass nowadays
Totally worth for the aesthetics. Not interested in the customer acquisition tactics for the game service of the publishing company active replacing game devs with ai. They can keep that part.

You reacted to this like you didn't research and buy it yourself. Do you have dementia?

Theres no bots whats this goofy are comment section.
'BRo thE bOTs""
Looks great. Do you plan to review the Rawm mouse? I want to try the ultra-light design and optical switch.
Um youjust gave us free gamepass
Who wouldn't want that??
You gotta buy the keyboard. It’s the same theme same creator, but the keyboard.
recharge being under is a crime
2000's gaming vibe:
I would get the mouse and it’s matching keyboard by the way, just for the sake of novelty because I collect Xbox stuff
Already redeemed
hehe
i got it
You have to be care full about the ""gamepass"" some brand lie about it its happened to me before when i got a 3rd party controller
SSHUT UP WITH THE BOTS
Alright. Pretty nice. Now hand it over
The keyboard is so nice
He obviously used the code first ️
? why did you just show it and not review it
I’m not sure why they made the plastic green as if it’s already been aged several years
Wait so you can play competitive fps with this mouse and it won't be considered cheating like ximming? Right?
Im trying to use the code but it won't let me.
I got the keyboard and mouse they look really cool but they feel really cheap so I honestly wouldn't recommend unless you just want it for the aesthetic
Everything comes with game pass. I ordered a Monster Hunter x Digimon vpet collab. It came with gamepass. It's not even a device that works with PC/xbox
try out the kreo-tech swarm gaming keyboard - its amazing value for the price! (its better than the Auala F75)
why is youtube just now showing me this
im gonna need 8bitdo to start making pc cases to go with there other accessories
game pass sound test?
ЧЕРТ ПОБЕРИ, У МЕНЧ ТОЧНО БЫЛА ТАКАЯ МЫШЬ
я поям уверен в этом, но это было года так в 2010-2013
So you cant use it while its charging? Automatic 0/10
If its as good as my G-502 id get it.
Pls review aula f75
What is the mouse for? Fps?
what if i just redeem the pass and refund the mouse
Can you ever give your own opinion anymore like it’s so tiring not being able to find a YouTuber with their own thoughts instead u find buy this buy that and now you’ve even fallen in that category
Code don’t work
POV the person that actually get the game pass
I wouldn't be against it
Did he run out of keyboards
How long does it last the gamepass
oooohhhhhHhHh link in the description guys oOOooooHhhh
who got the code?
Who tf redeemed the game pass?
I want it, not for the GamePass put because I need a new mouse
It looks cheap and uncomfortable
I love the keyboard but I shouldn’t have gotten it
I'm an Xbox person, but even I have to say no
GaMe PaSs HuH?!?!
Yo can u review the geeky gk61 pls
8bitdo is a good company when it comes to controllers and other things!
Can it drag click?
I need game pass ultimate all of my games won’t work with regular game pass
I want this
8bit DO, not DOUGH
Finaly not a keyboard
I like my women like I like my keyboards

Ergonomic and thocky
why you showing us code
Respe... Nah screw it
I have only know how to play games on xbox
Me I would

Chips huh what kond you wanting to get

Welcome back to mychannel. And if you're new here, hey,I'm Patricia, a 20something year oldliving in Atlanta, Georgia. For today'svideo, I wanted to do like a desk setuptour. I feel like I've accumulated a lotof stuff while, you know, having asetup. I've had it for about like threethree-ish years. And if you watched mylast setup tour, then you kind ofalready get the gist. But I did removesome stuff, minimize it a little bitcompared to like how my setup was waybefore when I had like my LED lights,all that extra stuff. But enoughyapping. Let's get into it. Let's justjump in and start with the peripherals,the setup, you know, the main stuff thatmakes a setup what it is. By the way, Iwill be linking everything in my setup,majority of everything, as much as I canin the description below. So, pleasecheck that out. And if I did leaveanything out or if you had anyadditional questions, just drop it downbelow and I'll try to get to it. Let'sget into the PC. So, I got my PCpre-built and I got it from RGB CustomPC. I know there's like a lot ofcontroversy currently with them cuz Igot a comment recently and they waslike, ""Oh, have you heard what's beengoing on? I guess some people aren'tgetting their PCs after like a month. Idon't know what's going on over there.""So, you know, just do your research.Figure out which company you want to geta pre-built from if you want to go thepre-built route or you can get the partsindividually and build yourself. Butyeah, I got a pre-built just because Idon't know PC stuff. I don't know how tobuild anything and I didn't want tolearn just because I was lazy at thetime. So, I was like, ""Yeah, let's justgo the easier route."" This was also likekind of during co so I was like, ""Thiswas the cost effective route for me.""Originally, when I ordered from RGBCustom, I didn't have any issues.Honestly, I got my PC like a week and ahalf after and I got status updateswhenever they were building it, whatupdates they were making when they werein the checking stages. And that's theonly experience I have with buying froma pre-built company. That's why I'mtelling you all my experience. But justbe wary, you know, like do your ownresearch. Figure out where you want toget yours from. For my specs, I'll putthem on the screen and also in thedescription below. This is she. And thenI got this chromi cute Funko Pop justchilling in there. And then the interior[Music]This PC cost me like about like 2,000something only because I got another PCfrom them. Originally it was like a pinkcase and it wasn't a three tier likethis. It was like just two tier andsomething happened. It broke. I sent itback to them and then I was like since Isent it back to them let me like upgradeit which I did and that cost me just alittle bit more. So I changed the case.They added an extra fan and then theyfixed the piece that was originallywrong with this PC. I honestly do wantto upgrade her though because I don'tknow. My friend Nomi, shout out Nomi, umshe built her PC and it looksphenomenal. Who knows, maybe I'll askfor her help and see how I can upgradeit because like this is cute and I'mkind of liking how she did it. It waslike a glass case here as well as overhere and then you you can just see theinterior more, you know? But this is notbad. Like I still love my PC. It's myvery first PC. And then to decorate it,similar to have the chromy inside, Ihave this cute little sunny angel andthen a Kirby and then a Miffy light. Itactually turnson. Super cute. But that is my PC andshe gets the job done, y'all. Like Iedit all my YouTube videos on here. Igame, record YouTube videos on OBSperfectly fine. And then I also am goingto start streaming soon. So let's seehow she holds up. So far after like thatinitial problem that I had with myoriginal PC and sent it back and gother. Um I don't think I had any issuesafter that. I actually lied. I hadanother issue with my PC. Um now that Ithink about it, something died again,but this time I brought it to MicroCenter and then they were able to fixit, but they had to wipe my entire PCbecause something got lost in thememory. But besides those two times, thePC has held up. Yeah, technicaldifficulties, but you know, that's thatcomes with, you know, having a PC.Enough about the PC, y'all. I feel likeI just been yapping about it forever.Now, on to the peripherals. So, theseare some HP monitors that I have. And Igot these monitors like 3 years agobefore the boycotting. This is just thebrand that I got cuz I went toMicroEnter and they had a deal and Ididn't want to spend crazy money. Butthese monitors are the HP. It's like 27in something. And I think the hertz is165 if I remember correctly. She hasheld up perfectly fine. Haven't had anissue with the monitors at all. And thenI got this cute little background fromGoogle. But I would usually use like umwallpaper engine. But you know sometimeswhen I'm editing I don't want to likehave the wallpaper engine. It's like ananimated wallpaper. It just it gets verydistracting. So I turn that off wheneverI'm editing and then I kind of forgot toturn it back on. So we're just chillingwith Spirited Away wallpaper for today.Sunny Angels. Sunny Angels on themonitors is a must. Okay. And then I gotmy Elgato face cam. This is what I'vebeen like recording my gameplay with.Sooner or later, who knows? Maybe I'llconnect my camera to see if I can usethat as a camera on Twitch just so I getclearer quality. And sorry about mycable management, y'all. Oh my god,that's I can't. We We don't talk abouther. But I did try to make it look nice.Um, speaking of that, like, as you guyscan see, my dual monitor mounts. Okay,got these from Amazon. They have like alittle bit of cable management help aidright there, but it doesn't do that muchhelp, honestly. So, honestly, I'mprobably going to see if I can get adifferent monitor mount just becauselike I feel like it's it's protrudingout a lot. Like, originally, I thoughtthese monitor mounts was going to belike closer to the wall, but yeah. Whoknows? That's just me complaining. Butso far, the mounts are okay. I'mprobably going to change it, but that'swhat I'm using currently. I just likethat they're white and they kind ofblend in with the desk. And then for mykeyboard, I kind of forgot where I gotmy keyboard. Having a massive brain fartand I can't remember. I think it wassent to me from a company. The name onthe USB is Yaola. A U L A. But yes, Ilove her so much. Like it's very simple.It's not over the top. The colorways arevery like basic and simple and it goeswith my setup pretty well. And they havevarious different light patterns.[Applause][Music]Yes, love this keyboard so much. Andit's not super long, too. Like, it'sjust a very standard keyboard size. Andyou guys are probably wondering, okay,but what is that like light in the back?I got y'all. Don't talk about my cables.But yeah, this is like a goi light thatI have on both my monitors. You canchange the color, but right now I justhave it on the white colorway. And youcould see the other one right here. Itjust gives your monitor and your setuplike a nice ambient lighting and alsohelps with the eyes like at night. On tothe next item is this adorable speaker.This is the Doom Ditto. They come invarious different colors. There's a pinkone, there's a white one, a green one,and then that's all I know off the topof my head. It's so tiny and compact,but it's strong. Like, the sound isthere, y'all. I brought this to a picnicone time, and it worked perfectly. Thisis my go-to speaker that I use wheneverI'm not using headphones. And then ithas these like animations, graphics,whatever you want to call it. Like ithas this cute BTS one. And then you canput the volume up, you can put thevolume down. There's a clock, but theseare the ones that I didn't get. Theycome with the actual device. So then ifyou need to change it, you just go tothe D Voom app. And then it connects toBluetooth and that's how you use it as aspeaker. And then the next piece, Itotally forgot this y'all. So this islike a cord coil for your keyboard. It'sjust there purposely for aesthetics. Andyou know, I'm here for it. I got thisfrom Glorious. And they have variousdifferent colors, but I just went withthe white one because I was like, it'svery simple and it's going to go with mysetup. And yeah, you just connect it toyour keyboard. Just there foraesthetics, and I'm here for it. Andthen this mouse, this is not my mousethat I usually use. I'm letting myboyfriend use my glorious mouse, so Ijust grabbed it from him. Um, it is awireless mouse. I feel like it just fitsmy hand perfectly, you know? Like it'snot super big. Just look at the colors.It's just very simple white and then ithas like accent colors which is supercute and they're the basic like RGBombre which matches my PC. Y'all see thedifference? Like this is just a littlebit bigger. And I got this from Amazon.It was like my first mouse. And then Iwent to Microsenter. I was like, ""Oh,okay. Let's upgrade."" And I got this badboy. And I love it. Like everybody needsa wireless mouse. It just comes in handylike when you're when you're gaming. Youcould just do all this stuff. And yeah,I obviously don't know how to explaintech that well in tech terms, but Idefinitely know how to do it in girlypop terms. And it's very cute. Now, onto this lovely guy that I haven't evenset up that I had for a year. I am goingto set this up probably after thisvideo. It's a stream deck. I want to putlike some cool sounds, transitions, allthat stuff that can help with my stream.But yeah, don't even lowkey forgot howto like set this set it up. Honestly,don't have much to say because I haven'tused it, but I'm excited to use it. TheRazor desk mat, but I love her. Again,it's just very simple. Um, it's not toolarge. Like, you know, some desk matslike it reaches all the way up here.This is just very like in one area. It'slike half of a desk. And I love it. Ikind of prepared myself that I knew likethis desk mat would get dirty because itis gray. It's a light gray color. But,you know, I think a little washing willhelp. And also, cool fact, this rimaround the mat lights up. I justcurrently don't have it plugged in rightnow. But yeah, you can manage thatthrough the Razer app, I believe. Andlike you can pick and choose whichcolors you want. Or you can do like aombre, which is pretty neat, likeespecially when you're gaming late atnight or just on your PC watchingsomething. And then it's like a coollike, you know, cute ombre, a subtle asubtle ombre. And then another piece ofmy perfumes is my HyperX mic. I got theblack color way before they had thewhite colorway come out. So, I'm so mad,but who knows, maybe around my birthdayor Christmas, I will get the white colorway. But for now, she's doing what shehas to do. Um, gets the job done. Andthen the arm is just this super cheaparm that I got from Amazon like yearsago when I first started getting stufffor my setup. And then you can changethe base with this, I believe. And inthe back they have like a notch to likedetermine how do you want this mic topick up how you're talking. Like do youwant it to be all around? Do you want itto be on the side? Like are yourecording with multiple people and youwant them to catch them as well or not?So yeah, this mic is pretty cool. Butyeah, that is my peripherals y'all. MyPC, kind of some decor that I got on it.Desk mat, keyboard, not the mouse that Iusually use, but I'm using it currently.two monitors, mic arm for the mic,keyboard, speaker, stream deck, webcam,and then some decor. Very simple andstraight to the point for a feels. Ihave this white gaming chair. I used tohave the pink GRCing one and then I soldit. It was too bright, you know? I kindof grew out of having like a pink gamingchair. It was cute for the moment, but Ijust wasn't feeling it. So, I got thiswhite one and I love it. It's verycomfortable and like it has this likepattern on it. There's cushion on thereand then a cool feature and it's like afootrest or leg rest or whatever you maycall it. Yeah, I think this is like theeco something style kind of chair. It'slike good for your back or whatever. Andthen the desk. This desk is from IKEA,but it's just like your regular decularIKEA desk. Um I low key need to likeinstall a like a third leg in themiddle. I don't know if you guysnoticed, but like my desk is like it'sround in the middle. like it's dentingin the middle. You'll see that. So, Ithink I need to install a third leg forthat support. And I blame it on themonitors. Like, they're so heavy. Thisdesk is also from IKEA. It's just like asmaller version of this desk. But thisone has more wear and tear just becauseI had this mic arm right here. And Inoticed that I didn't have it all theway in. So, it was kind of like pullingat it whenever I was moving my mic. Butnow, I moved it backwards and I have itlike super good in there. But yeah, youcan see the damage. My god. But I've hadthis desk for like ever since thebeginning. So, 3 years. And that is myperipherals. And now, let's move on tothe cutesy stuff over here that makes mydesk setup like my desk setup. Like Isaid, these are two separate desks. So,like you're going to see this lineregardless. Oh, and then this is abetter view of my monitor mounts. Like,you see how far they come out? I don'tlike that. Like I feel like if I hadthem closer to the wall, I'll have morespace to like, you know, actually gameand just to do stuff, you know? It'staking up half of the desk basically. Sothis is my headset. This is the Razerheadset. Like it's not the wireless one.It has wires. They originally didn'tcome with these cat ears. I bought themseparately and just like attach them on.I know people say they're heavy and Ican see that. That's why I kind of likego in between them and also like myregular ear pods. Of course, I have alittle Kirby right here to accompany theheadphones. And then this little gadgetright here is like a label printer. Iuse this like whenever I go on trips andI need to label something real quick. Itcomes in handy. And you guys areprobably wondering like, okay, what isthis contraption? What is this? It'skind of like a desk bookshelf organizer.And my boyfriend's dad built this forme. I know I got a lot of questionsabout that. And she's stunning. Oh mygoodness. But yeah, we'll get into her.Don't mind this. This is just anotherlike dent in this desk. But yeah,underneath the bookshelf organizer, Ihave like these compartments of stuff.This is just remotes that I have tocontrol stuff. And then the second oneis like hand sanitizer, lippy stuff. Andthen the third one is just wires. Then Ihave some manga on display. We have thewhole series of What the Koi. So that's1 through six. And then we have In theClear Moonlight Dusk, 1 through 5. Andthat's not the whole series. I haven'tcollected manga in a minute, y'all. So Iknow I'm behind. But yes, as you guyscan tell from this, I'm a shojo girly. Ilove romance. Hopeless romantic. Okay.And I love reading about it. And nowabove it, I have just some cutetrinkets. This is another This is dead,by the way. I should have charged it.But it's similar to the Ditto overthere. Like you see how it has that cutescreen on there? This does the samething. And it's also a speaker. Supertiny. And you can put like animatedartwork on there to have on display.I'll charge this actually. And then Ihave some trinkets, blind boxes on here.This is from PopMart. It's the Herono. Iforgot which series, but this one'ssuper cute. This is also from PopMart.This is the Peach Riot version. And thenthis is a mythy blind box that I gotfrom Kinounia. And it comes with alittle Miffy. And then I have thiscapital pin um that I like keep rightthere. This is how it looks. It looksbare right now because I took thespeaker and I'm charging it right now.Now, right here, there's a middlecompartment in between like the twomanga areas, which I use for like, youknow, random stuff. So, I have thisHello Kitty notepad that fits perfectlyin there for whenever I need to quicklyjot something down. And if you guyscouldn't tell, I'm a BTS army, okay? So,I had the Butter album just chilling inthere. And y'all look how perfect itfits. Oh, it was like it was made forthat. And then this fits in pretty well,too. And since I'm an army, if you'renew here, I kind of want to see like,can you guess who my bias is? Now, on tomore manga. I have six volumes of Signof Affection. And in the back overthere, I have a Japanese version of Signof Affection. And then I have volumes 1through six of Blue Spring Ride. Andagain, these are all Showjo. No shame inthat. Okay. And then I have a lovelySmitzky right there protecting themanga. And now above all that manga, wehave more trinkets. So, we have thiscute Kirby. It's like a mochi Kirby. Igot this at Mini. So, the next figure isa Hatsune Miku one. This is the Sherryversion. I got this at an animeconvention. And then this little likecup. It's like a Spirited Away teacupthat I got from Barnes & Nobles. I thinkI just put some of my cute pens that Ihave. Like this is a BTS pen. This is acute pen. Um yeah, just all these cutepens. Look at that. Oh, and then Iforgot this guy. And then this isanother version of Kirby. And I justkeep that like right there. And nowbehind Hatune Miku, I have this anotherlike gadget. This is again from Doom.This isn't a speaker though. It's justlike it just adds some cool ambiancelighting. Let's see if it'sdead. It's dead. I'm going to chargethis so I can show youall what it lookslike. But it's very cool. Like you canchange the lighting with this. And theyhave various different options. And thenthis photo card in the back. Minyongifrom DTS. This is my bias if y'allwasn't able to guess it in time. I havethese cute little prints that I got fromShutterfly and I think they were free. Ijust had to pay for shipping at the timecuz they were doing a deal. They justlike spice up the wall a little bit. Nowon to my pegboard that I got from IKEA.This is like the standard size pegboard.It's not the large one. It's just theregular one. And then to decorate it, Igot these like little pieces that theyalso had. So these are just some keysthat I have for keyboards. And I thoughtit was cute to put them on display. Andthen I have this Herono figure. I forgotwhich series, but y'all, he fitsperfectly right there. Oh my goodness.And then next to it, I have thisportable CD player that I got fromAmazon. And then of course, a new jeansCD album. And this is the remote thatgoes with it. I don't even know if it'splugged in though. Pretty well. Like thesound isn't too bad, but you know, it'snot like um a surround sound type ofanything. But for like 20 or $25, it'spretty good. Nostalgic. And then we moveup a little bit and we have my Apple AirMaxes. And then over here, this is JunkCoup. He's my bias recorder or honestlyhe may be like handinhand but with Yi.And then I have myAirPods. I forgot what this thing iscalled. Is it Pochica? Um but it's fromChainsaw Man. Andoh, and I got that from an animeconvention. It's just so cute. And atthe very top of the pegboard, I havemore blind box figures. They're eitherthe Herono series or the Peach Riotseries. And aren't they just so cute?Like these girls right here, they are socool. And Heronos are just like oddlyweird, but I love it. And then chill inthe corner is of course a Sunny. Itotally forgot to show y'all this blindbox figure. But this is another PeachRiot. This is Frankie. And she'sprobably my favorite out of the three.Like look at that. She looks so cool. Somy favorite would probably be Frankie,Poppy, and then I don't even know this.Is it Gigi? Is that her name? This iswhere I keep all my like markers,highlighters, pens, rulers, erasers, allthat stuff. And then, of course, a Kirbyjust chilling. But yeah, that iseverything on this side table that Ihave. And it's a lot, but I feel likeit's it's not over the top, you know,like it's very tasteful and simple, butkind of like maximist in a way, but verycutesy and trinkety. And y'all get it,right? And I love how everything justblends together so seamlessly and likeit doesn't look too much but it's justenough, you know, very girly, mangarelated, K-pop related. And yeah,underneath my desk setup, I have thisMiffy rug that me and my boyfriend made.We went to like a tufting class for ouranniversary. And this is the contraptionthat I created. It doesn't even looklike Miffy. It looks like Miffy oncrack, but you know, um, memories. So Iwas like, this is very cute. Then I havea trash can. And then I have some cablemanagement right here underneath, whichdoesn't even look all that good, y'all.Like cable management and me do not gohand in hand. So you see thisloveliness. And you go underhere. What is that? Jump scare. Jumpscare. Okay, this is the cablemanagement that I tried to make work,but I kind of got lazy in the midst ofit. And then it's just like a bundle abundle of wires. It's just a bundle ofwires. But next to it, I have like somemore stuff, you know, miscellaneousstuff. This is a controller that I usesometimes. This is like the handle forthat mic right there. So, if I wanted toput it on the table, I could. And thenright here, this is like for mystationary giries. Washitape. Okay. I just have a bunch of washitape. A cute littlestapler. More washi tape. A littlenotepad. Stickers. So, like whenever Ido giveaways or whatever, I like to givethe winners like these stuff. Just somerandom stuff. Write them a note. And Igot this Miffy sticker thingy. And thenthese are more Myiffy stickers. This iscinnamon rollstickers. My melody stickers. Literally,y'all, I have somuch. And then on the third row, it'sjust like a lot of like sticky notes.And then I got this eraser from MountFuji. And then when you erase it, it'slike it's shaped like Mount Fuji. Moresticky notes and stuff, tabs, likey'all, just stationary heaven, if I mustsay. Underneath all that, I have like mybig K-pop photos that does not fit in myphoto album book that I have cuz I havelike a main one that like suits all thesmall ones, the small photos, but theseare like super big. We have junk cook.More junk cookook.Yi tay. And then this whole compartmentorganizer thing. I got this from IKEA.And it's just like so much stuff, y'all.Like I am probably not going to gothrough it one because it's notorganized and it's a lot. I have likeNintendo cases. This is my K-pop albumbook that I was going to show y'all.Okay. And this is my K-pop album book.It's nothing crazy. I know people havelike so much, but I just have like, youknow, I just have New Jeans and BTSbecause those are the two albums that Ipurchased before. I don't purchase K-popalbums crazy though. And like I said, Iwas going to show y'all how this Voomthing works. I think it's the DoomPlanet 9 or something. But yeah, if youjust twist this knob at the top, it haslike all these color options. It justkind of just adds some fun color to yoursetup. I'll probably leave it on thatone. That one's cute, right? And thenthis one, this is how it looks. I haveto like connect it with the D Voom app,but you guys get the point. We have likea cute animation on here. But yeah, thatis my setup, y'all, in a nutshell.Overall, a lot of the stuff in my setupI purchased myself. Uh there is stuffhere and there that was gifted to me. Alot of it came out of pocket, but worthit though because I absolutely love howmy setup turned out. But I'm glad I wasable to share my setup with you guysbecause I know some of y'all who are newhere had some questions and wonderingwhere I got stuff. If you made it thisfar into the video, I just want to thankyou so so much for watching. I hope youenjoyed. And if you did, please makesure to like, comment, and subscribe.That was actually so much fun justyapping about my setup. So, I reallyhope you all enjoyed. Bye guys. See youin the next video.[Music]Heat. Heat.","back from a little hiatus, i missed y'all! <3
seeing your serup over the years is craazy cause it's stayed relativley the same but it's still always shocks me?! it's so beautiful.
your desk setup looks very comfortable to work and lounge in, love it
I also have the Aula keyboard! I love it so much, but I changed the keycaps to the Osume Dalgona keys. So it's a pretty, cozy brown color. Like coffee!
Hello Queen! Amazingly cute setup! Sorry to provide unsolicited advice, but I always recommend for gaming and work desk setups to get custom cut plexiglass for tabletops. Just take the tabletop measurements down to Lowe's Depot and they cut it to fit and it's cheap. Protects your desktop, easy to clean, and you can decorate under the plexi with photos and such. Love it for my WFH + gaming setup. 
What games are you playing?
I've been addicted to ESO since 2015 and now Diablo 4. Still dabble in FN, but I'm horrible.
Litterly soo stinking cuteee and ilysmm
Love your desk set and I love spirit away
Whoa! This setup is amazing
for the monitor mount use a piece of 1in wood on top the mount and under neath the mount to take the sag out it helped me cause i use 3 monitors
So cute!
I got a prebuilt from RGBcustoms too back in Dec 2023 and I was lucky to get it before stuff went down. I got a free livestream to watch too because I was already hanging out in streams for about a year before I bought. But about a few months after getting my pc apparently they filed for bankruptcy, shut down their store and sites and didn't send some ppl's pcs out so that was a shock. A shame cause I really liked them and would've bought from them again in the future. 

Anyways your setup is really cute~
I love to hear patricia yap
heyyyyy YouTube fam
Hey Army! Definitely Suga Bias!

","So, about 6 months ago, I did a video ofbuilding my dream room, but it alwaysfelt like something was missing. Iwasn't completely happy with the waythat it turned out. So, today I'm goingto correct my mistake, and I'm going tobuild my actual dream room and dreamgaming setup. All right, first thingsfirst. I went to Walmart and bought adresser. We got Brian here. He's goingto put it together, and I'm going torecord. Wait, what? It says easyassembly. So, we should be able to getit put together in about 5 minutes tops.But I bought a dresser to really get ridof that black cube shelf that Briankeeps walking in front of. And it'sgoing to eliminate this ugly thing outof my closet. You ready to put ittogether? Mhm. All right. Let's juststart off by saying this thing was noteasy to put together. Even though theinstructions said easy assembly. Well,maybe it would have been easier if itwasn't two idiots putting it together,but it probably took us a solid 2 hoursto put this thing together. There yougo. Now that I got that built, which Igot to say, it looks a lot better. Mynext problem lies with this wall rightabove my gaming setup. It is just soblank. It makes my setup look boring. Itjust I need to put something rightthere. Another thing from Walmart. Ibought these two little shelves and I'mgoing to put them like I'm going to putone here and then one a little bithigher on this side. And I'm not excitedto hang these because they're floatingshelves and they're Walmart shelves. Sothey they're going to be a nightmare tohang. First shelf is up. That only tookme about 15 minutes. Let's get thesecond one up. Even that right therejust adds so much. But of course, I willbe decorating them. I'm just waiting onsome Amazon packages. And here are theAmazon packages. So, these aren'tactually from Amazon. One of my coworkergave me these. She had them sitting inher house. And then I got some cheap uhLED lights for the back of my dresser.And then we're going to open this Amazonpackage cuz I got some cool stuff inhere, too. So, the first thing we got ismy brand new mouse pad. I am so excitedfor this. I had one very similar to it.Look at that. It's going to match allthe white furniture I have in here.These are my brand new hanging plants.Oh my gosh. I didn't think they werethat long. And there's three of them inhere. And then we got a second one andthe third one. Yeah. Let's get thisstuff put up.Dude, I did not realize how long thatone was, but I think it looks sogood. And the last thing I got, it's alittle bit big, but it's this uh bigtree thing. Yeah, I got this little fakebamboo. Well, my grandmother gave it tome cuz I've been looking for them andthey're so expensive and she found thisat a yard sale for like $3. So, I'mgoing to put this right here. My newdresser. I just got to put the LEDlights on the back of the dresser. So,I'm going to go ahead and pull that outand that's what I'm going to do now.This thing is so freaking[Music]heavy. I got them plugged in andworking. This is what it looks like now.Here, let me slide this plant back overhere. Look at that, dude. That looks sogood. So, other than the new mouse pad,my setup is going to remain pretty muchthe same. And because of that, I'm justgoing to go over the peripherals for thepeople who have not watched my channelbefore. I have the Blue Yeti mic on afine fine boom arm. I have the RazerHuntsmanMini. I have the Logitech Pro Superite2, the best mouse I've ever used.Obviously, the brand new mouse pad. Ihave an Acer 27 in curved 240 Hz displaymonitor. I just have a regular basic 165Hz monitor as my vertical display. Andthen a Logitech I want to say C922 if Iremember correctly. I might be wrongabout that. And just a basic light thatI got off of Amazon. And if you guyswant to know more about the PC, I havean entire video of it on my channel.This thing is a beast. Yeah, that's mysetup. Now I think that it's time forthe final cinematic of this video.","You have inspired me to make content for my channel

i think the proper term is ""optimum tech style set-ups""
Didn’t know but I had a comp setup for almost a year now good thing it’s a trend btw you can add personality minimalistic way too like the mousepad wallpaper and more so great
Luv ur vids Aiden you inspire me big bro
bro can you create a detail video about your comp setup
that red setup at the beginning is so tuff
Comp because it’s for use and not just for looks
Bro getting multiple setups while i look at used dell optiplexes
Fr can u give me tips on a good comp setup I’m trying to make one to
Imagine, that you can have raw gaming performance and make it aesthetically pleasing at the same time?
ive legit been saying this for 2+ years bruh
sadly i had a comp setup before the trend and i hate it
But we all know rgb gives 10+ fps
On that second one with the all black setup does anybody know what monitor mount that is ?
I agree so much I’m hesitating so much on how to make my setup i’ll already be building my pc in 3 weeks right after my exams but i need help with layout idk what to do
Optimum was the main reason of some of this setups.
I have a mix of both, i have one of those aesthetic wood setups but i focused some of my peripheral on gaming like a 170hz monitor artisan zero and g pro superlight2 a mix of aesthetics and gaming with minimalistix design
Love that gravastar keyboard. I have the all white!
In the first comp setup does anyone know what the monitor stand is?
I prefer ur comp setup because its so much more cozy ngl and just simpler
In my opinion this is not a trend but they started popping of now a lot I had mine like a few years before till this day it is timeless
I need help for a monitor recommendations between 24-27 inches, at least 165hz and with good colors. And preferably under $200
Im too broke for any setup bro i have a 60 hz 2014 dell monitor
Sorry I’m not doing anything without to monitor unless I’m actually playing on a stage
I’m working a job to earn a 10000 dollar comp setup to throw everything in it
I was going to go with aesthetic but im got very good at Fortnite so I wanted to have a comp setup thank god I did I love it.
Need some advice I have a black desk should I just go full black with some rgb or like a white keyboard and mouse and have some contrast
Your dog is so cute!!!!!
Comp setups are way better than a over decorated setup (sry for my english)
If you can afford a comp setup you don’t need to play comp
I saw a crazy setup fkr 80 dollors
Comp setup are not I still cant afford It
I'm trying to build my dream setup
my setup
I have a comp setup for fortnite
Love the anime girl black red and white picture, anyone have a steam wallpaper engine of it?
Honestly comp setups are still really athesthetic
Someone copied your video, or you copied them just saying like word by word
Comp setups COOK 
I’ve had a crazy 20,000 dollar setup for years,but still I cannot win a penny back on cod because I focused too much on LIGHTS and not performance 
comp setups have already earned me 600 dollars back!
If it ain't RGB, it ain't for me... if you don't agree, ..
...see more
Hey gutsy I wanted to ask during the last stream I won the giveaway and I still haven’t received the mousepad so I was just asking if it was still coming
W
i:m the only one who think comp setup are ass , copy paste = comp setup , one monitor , pc on the floor or on the edge , a keyboard , mouse , iem , and microphone , they ALL look the same and that destroyed the setuptok its sad
Comp
Day 142 of asking for a pc everyday till I get one
This is not cozy

Comp

He has an extremely small andmessy desk, a 10-year-old gaming PC, andsome of the ugliest walls I have everseen. Genuinely, what even is this? AndI think it's safe to say he is welloverdue for a setup revamp. So, I'mabout to completely destroy his setupfor a fresh start and turn this spaceinto his dream gaming setup with amazingdecor and lighting, top-of-the-linegaming gear, and the best gaming PCimaginable. All thanks to MSI. Now, thisisn't actually my little brother's roombecause I don't even have a brother, buthe is my younger cousin. And ever sincewe were kids, we have done absolutelyeverything together. So, pretty much thelittle brother I never had. And perfectenough, his birthday's coming up in thenext 3 days. So, I thought, what bettertiming to surprise him with a brand newgaming setup that he has zero clueabout. What you going to get me for mybirthday? No. Uh, okay. And with himbeing busy with school and out of townfor track meets these next few days,this couldn't have aligned any better.But since we're on a pretty tighttimeline and have absolutely no room forerror, I better get started. I firstlysnuck into his house a few days ago toget measurements of the walls while hewas at school and then went back home to3D model exactly how I wanted thisgaming setup to look. Which leads usback to present day. Stood here in hisroom with the perfect plan. Now I'vejust got to execute it. First thingsfirst, we need to get this absolute messof an area we have here cleaned upbecause, well, do I really need toexplain why this ended up taking me alittle longer than expected as he justhas so much useless stuff laying around?Well, he won't be needing thisanymore. But after clearing the spaceout completely, it was finally time tocover up this atrocious looking wall.Now, I know in the last few setups I'vebuilt on this channel, I've lowkey beenspamming the wooden wall panel method,and I'm doing it again. But to betotally fair, it's kind of my onlyoption this time around. And as soon asI was about to start putting up thepanels, it clicked in my head that thistruly was not going to be easy as itusually is. I just realized with thiswall having a really strange shape andnot even being flat, the panels wouldlook really weird and uneven if I triedto put them on right now. So, aftersitting in fear that this entire plancould have been ruined just like that,it finally clicked in my head exactlywhat to do. Okay, we've got to run tothe wood store like now. And after a notso fun 40-minute drive, I grabbed somewooden screws I needed, got back toBrighton's house, and began to drillthese perfectly sized wooden pieces intothe wall to act as more support for ourpanels to be stuck onto, while alsomaking the surface completely even. Allright, this may or may not lookabsolutely horrible right now, but justtrust the process.All I can say is, wow, this looks somuch better already. Now, kind of how Isaid earlier that I've been using thewooden wall panel method a whole lotlately, I wanted to at least make thisone a little different. So, I decided tomix white and black panels, and I thinkit turned out really nice. But, this issadly all I'm going to be able to do forday one because the next step in this isbuilding the actual gaming setup. And Ican't quite start that yet because thedesk hasn't even arrived yet. So, toutilize the rest of the time I had in myday to stay on track with finishing thesetup before Braden's birthday, I wentback to my house and began to build thisstacked out gaming PC that MSI suppliedall of the parts for, which once all puttogether was about to make a beast. Withthe motherboard having a ton of usefulfeatures, installing all the componentswas about to be a breeze with its easyDIY design while also looking supersleek with its carbon black pattern andRGB lighting. For the CPU, we're rockingthe Intel Core Ultra 9285K processor,which is perfect for this build, beingideal for high-end gaming, which isexactly what Braden will be doing. Ithen snapped in 96 GB of Kingston FuryDDR5 RAM to bring ultra fast performanceand match the motherboard real nicelywith both having a sleek look. Andthankfully, with the motherboard havingan easy M.2 clip, installing his SSD wasso simple without having to deal withany obnoxious little screws. As for thecase I'm putting this build into, it's acomplete all blacked out look withpre-installed fans, which is so helpfulin speeding up the build process. So,after getting the motherboard screweddown into the case, I then got startedon the power supply unit, which isusually the step that stumps me themost. But thankfully, this time around,it was extremely easy to get set up andsuper straightforward where to plugeverything into. For the cooler, I usedthe Mad Core Liquid A15360, which tookalmost no time at all and really made meappreciate the MSI ecosystem in thisbuild since being able to link up allthe fans and RGB would be no trouble atall thanks to MSI Center. And last, butnot least, it was finally time to tossin the best part of any PC build, whichis the GeForce RTX 4080 from MSI. Now,with this card being so large andnaturally sagging a little, the casecool enough has a built-in GPU supportbracket to easily solve this problem.And just like that, we now have a beastof a system to put into Brad and setuptomorrow that not only looks good, butwill run great as well. And now that Ifinished building the PC, I headed tobed for the night and prayed that thedesk would be sitting on my front porchwhenever I woke[Music]up. Okay, this moment right heredetermines if the rest of this video iseven possible or if it's going to becompletely ruined. Please be here, bro.Please be here. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Ican't even lie. I was getting a littlenervous there for a second. All righty.We're back here in Braden's room andit's officially time to build this kidan insane gaming setup. So, I moved inhis desk and quickly got it unboxedwhere I then barely realized what kindof desk this actually was. No. No. Oneof these again. The last time I builtone of these two-piece tabletop desks ina video, I almost broke it and ruinedthe entire surprise of building mysubscriber their dream setup. So, I wasstarting to feel true fear and deja vuof this happening again. But, I ended upabsolutely locking in and putting thisdesk together withease. I am cooking. I am cooking. So,before getting the actual setup put ontothe desk, I firstly laid down a rugbecause I'm not going to lie, this tileis absolutely chopped. I then brought inall of the lighting going into thesetup, which was way more than I thoughtI had bought. Oh my gosh. To my aunt,uncle, I am so sorry about yourelectricity bill. And after getting allthe rope lights unboxed and putting astrip onto the desk, I began to get in aflow state getting these put on thepanels until I got some of the worstnews imaginable. Huh? No way. Liketoday? What time? All right. All right.Bye. I might have just got the worstcall I could have gotten possible today.So, my aunt just called me to tell methat Braden is coming home today in afew hours after all instead of tomorrow.And I'm not even halfway done withputting these lights up. I'm reallygoing to have to speed things up. Oh,that shifts everything. Luckily, I hadalready prepped all the lights to beplaced onto the panels before I got thatcall. So, I was able to breeze throughgetting them put on pretty quickly. Butafter eyeing Braden's location for thelast little bit, he's approximately likean hour and a half away. And we stillhave an entire setup to put together anddefinitely a pretty big mess to clean upas well. So, I then picked up as muchstuff as I could off the floor and wentto bring in the MSI build for his setup.This might actually be the most I'vebeen stressed out since I had to searchseven chest at risky reels. So, for thePC, it's of course the one I built theother day, and this thing is a beast. SoBraden, you absolutely have zero excuseto keep getting knocked in duos now. Andfor the monitors, MSI hooked them upwith not only one OLED monitor, but twoOLED monitors. Oh my gosh, bro. Setup isactually going to be better than mine.And once I got them unboxed, I wasgenuinely amazed with how they looked.How are they both so slim? That isactually unreal. Dude, these are goingto look so good with gaming. So, aftergetting Visa mounts put onto bothmonitors, I then put them in the bestmonitor layout possible. One horizontal,one vertical. Argue with a wall. Andthis lastly led into laying down theperipherals as the finishing touchbefore completing the setup, which wasthe Forge GK300 combo, which honestlyboth sound and felt really nice. And asthe last peripheral going in the setup,MSI sent him the Immerse GH50 because Idefinitely don't want Brighton beingthat one friend that doesn't have a micin the party and causes us to have touse FaceTime. And so it's not just saton his desk in a messy way. I got thisreally cool headset stand that lights upto match the vibe of the setup. So Brainwill be arriving here in the next 5minutes. So I need to hurry up and getall these lights turned on anddefinitely clean up the area because I'dsay it's seen better days, but it lookedpretty bad in here before. So I'm goingto get his mom to stall for as long aspossible because this might take me alittle bit. And it sure did take a whilebecause after cleaning up this huge messI left, I then hurried up and tried myabsolute best to cable manage as fast asI could. But Braden ended up showing upa little sooner than I imagined. So,what I was able to do in such a shorttime will have to do because it isfinally time to surprise him with whatI've been working on these last fewdays. I believe Braden just pulled up.Now, we just got to surprise him. Bro,I'm so nervous. What's up, man? What'sup? First off, stressed me out today. Ithought you going to be home tomorrow,but do you remember the other day wewere testing those Philly cheese steaks?Yeah. And you said, ""What am I going toget you for your birthday?"" I saidnothing originally, but I want to showyou something. So, first off, happyearly birthday. Thank you. Few daysearly, but we go check it out. Are youready? Yeah.Oh my gosh,[Music]dude. Although this took so much effortand energy to create such a drasticdifference in this room. I'm so tired,but I want to go to bed. The payoff wastotally worth it as Braden was supergrateful. Thank you, bro. That's crazy.Shaking, bro. That's kind of crazy. Iwant to give a huge thanks to MSI forsponsoring this video as without them,none of this would have been possible.So, make sure to go check out all oftheir awesome products that I used inthis video, which will be linked down inthe description.

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Looks AMAZING DUDE !
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
I remember doing this for my room when I was getting my first gaming pc last year. I was suppose to only paint the corner of my room and then I ended up doing my whole room over and changing pretty much everything it was an amazing feeling when it came together.
I just revamped my room so this was pretty inspiring to add a couple more things in, loved it!
the pace of your storytelling is wonderful - not too slow to become boring but also not too fast to feel rush. I literally feel like Im actually living with you. You have a new subscriber here, thank you for making this vid
your video really motivates many people to re decor their rooms, as a full time college student and job, a side with streaming, i need to make my Room as Aesthetic as your room is now !
if i may give some more suggestions:
id recommend putting a curtain in front of your closet. it really blocks off the clutter plus i think a black curtain would look beautiful

i would personally also clean up the shelf above your setup a bit. there is a TON of stuff on it and the colors really clash agains the cozy vibe with your room. so if i were you id pick a few things i really like and put them on there, and the others somewhere else :D

overal, awesome video! i envy you!
The wood with the black was an AMAZING choice. I saw it before you even brought it up and went ""oooooooh thats gonna look good""
Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
That xenohunter knife is sick man (also your room)
this was a crazy transformation, you look MAD different since the last time we interacting and i'm glad to see you slowly killing the tech game. KEEP THIS SHIT UP
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
Im moving out soon and have been looking for room inspo. This gave me a clear idea of what I want my room to look like. Thanks a lot man
!!
Great video!!! stumbled upon it in my feed
Personally am a white/green with wood accents type of guy but I dig your overall update!
Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!
not gonna lie ... this turn out sick ... the way you turn this small room is so awesome... lot of love.
As many people are saying, the quality of this video and the editing are expected of a large channel! Keep at it, this was great!
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!
Love how dude just clipped his mic to his glasses
This video deserves a million views.
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
I’m so close to getting my dream setup I’ve been saving for a while now and have about 200$ I need way more but these type of videos inspire to keep saving up you’ve gained a new subscriber
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
don't remove the paper/seal on the PC with the PC on sometimes if its sealed to much it will cause static and maybe mess up ur pc for a bit but DW its ez to fix
man you deserve more subs, more views, more everything. You're a great youtuber and the fact you spent this much with only a small amount of subs has gotten you my respect.
How do you only have 11k man!?! Love the video and the whole design you went with, it's phenomenal! I eventually want to revamp my entire room and try and stream and make videos again!
first time watching you, and i have never ever stayed seated at my setup for that long just for a youtube video, keep it up man (great job with the editing)
Honestly, there isn't a lot of people make setup videos anymore and this was nice to see. Really great video and I'm definitely hitting that subscribe button. Keep up the great work!!! Sick setup!
this is amazing. You really did achieve a dream setup
Great Video! Loved the aesthetic. One small suggestion to get a black curtain to hide your closet + also keep dust and sunlight off your clothes.
I didn't expect this kind of quality from a channel with only 11k subs, great job bro keep it up!!
love the style you went for, amazing setup bro!
Loving the nice clean aesthetic of the room, and also the high end quality of the video itself. Seriously deserving of more attention. Keep up the great work man, you're doing an incredible job.
I'm yapping too much (12:30) is the most accurate statement ever!!
That wall with the black paint, the lights and the plant instantly improved the room, proper class! (Just needs to be not hidden by the bed! ) 2 mattresses though! I did that years ago and found it made my back worse! One of them was a cheapo one though, also do you notice much light coming through the canisteo window blinds? Look like they aren't flush to the sides if that makes sense?

Great set up BTW, room looks so much better after changing the decor!
It's always a treat finding Habesha YouTubers. Love ur vids gang
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
0:19 Not trying to be offensive or disrespectful, but low-key reminded me of Cookie from, ""Ned's Declassified. Which is an awesome character that brings charm to the group, which is my favorite when waiting for each episode.
room turned out dope!
love it dude! Im on my room revamping journey now as well. This helps a lot!
Boy 10/10 room bro you nailed it
this style IS the new ""rgb"" style
You just got another sub bro! Love the raw and genuine content.
setup looks crazyyy
I’m new to the channel and I can already tell you got potential. It was such a chill video I genuinely enjoyed it. And the end product Keep up the good work

Tech reviews & Travel tips in cinematic mode.\n\nLets work together! : davidcs2007@gmail.com\n\n\n,"[Music]Hi guys, today's video is sponsored byPuffer Rocks. More on that later.Welcome back guys to a new video. TodayI'm going to show you my gaming desksetup tour. So, let's get into it.Keeping a clean and organized desk isessential for getting the most out ofyour gaming experience. A wellarrangedspace not only boosts focus and reducesdistractions, but also enhancesperformance. Plus, a tidy environmenthelp protect your gear by preventingdust build up that can affect how yourdevices work. In short, a good setupdoesn't just look great, it level upsyour gameplay. So, let's start with thedesk. In previous videos, I already showyou how I built this custom desk bymyself. The wood has a clear finish tocreate contrast with the main wall, andthe table legs are made of metal, makingit very solid desk. They're also paintedin black to match the overall look. Iuse two monitor for different consoles.The smaller one is a 24 in full HDSamsung monitor with a 75 Hz refreshrate. That's why it cost less than$120. Originally, I bought it as asecondary monitor for my PC, but now Iuse it for my Nintendo Switch OLED,which doesn't really need more than 60Hz or 4K resolution. The colors areokay, but don't expect 100%sRGB. This monitor just isn't for that.Honestly, I don't recommend it at all.As you may know from my last video, Ihave my Nintendo Switch OLED connectedto the dock and this monitor. That'swhere I play some of my favorite gameslike Super Smash Bros., Mario Bros. orPokemon. The second monitor is a 27 inLG 4K display. It only has 60 Hz refreshrate, but the image quality isexcellent. I placed it on a customhighrise shelf I made with the same woodfinish as the desk I originally boughtit for editing videos and photos, butnow I use it for gaming, too. While it'snot ideal for fast-paced games, theimage quality and connectivity areawesome. This monitor is connected to mygaming PC. It doesn't have the latestspecs, but it still perform perfectlyfor a casual gamer like me. It's poweredby a Ryzen 5 3.6 6 GHz with 16 GB ofRAM, 2 TB of internal storage, and aNvidia GeForce RTX 2060. I boughted thisPC in 2021. It was my first gamingbuild. With these specs, I can playWarson, FIFA, Dragon Ball, and manyother titles with no problem. Forperipherals, I use a Fifine, whichoffers great sound quality. You canadjust the audio and mute volumedirectly and mute the mic by tapping theicon. Even though it's not a physicalbutton, I didn't just buy the mic. I gotit as a part of a combo that includes amixer. With the mixer, I can controlaudio levels, change my voice, customizebuttons, change the RGB lighting, andmore. By the way, the audio in thisvideo is recorded using this mic so youcan hear it for yourself. Now, let'stalk about the mouse pad or actually thelack of one. Instead of a traditionalmouse pad, I use a custom rock fromPuffy Rocks, today's sponsor. It's anarmor rack for my keyboard. I simplymessaged them on Instagram and asked ifthey could make me a Ruron Noah designand they did it. If you want a customrock like this, feel free to reach outto them. They have a tons of cooldesigns, including this Roron Noah Sororock. For the keyboard, I use amechanical one from Freewolf with brownswitches. To be honest, the only thing Ilike about it's the design. The key cupsare hard to press and the material feelsreally cheap. But what do you expectfrom a $40 wireless keyboard? The truthis, I don't really use keyboards forgaming. I'm more into gaming withcontrollers, especially the Xboxcontroller. I used to play with PS3controllers, but ever since I got myXbox One, I've gotten used to Xboxcontroller. My first pro controller wasthe Power A Xbox Pro controller, butafter 2 years of using it started todiscolor like this. So, I upgraded tothe OG Xbox Elite controller, whichfeatures adjustable tension thumbsticks, a wrap around rubberized grip, ashorter hair trigger locks, and itoffers endless customizations withinterchangeables, components, andexclusive bottom mapping via the Xboxaccessories app. Honestly, it was agreat investment. The mouse I choose isthe Logitech G502 Hero. It's anincredible mouse very quickly. You cancustomize the buttons and the weight.The only downside of this one is thatit's not wireless. The design andquality are perfect for the price. Forheadphones, I've tried several,especially Logitech. I started with theLogitechG332, then tried the wireless G435, andnow I'm using the G335. These headphonesare awesome. The sound quality isperfect. The mic works great. It evenmutes when flip it up and they are superlightweight for long gaming sessions.Below my 27in monitor, I keep myinternet router and an Alexa Show 5. Iuse it to check the time, play music, orask random questions. Between bothmonitors, I have my Belin 15 wattsMaxafe charging station which charges myphone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Back tothe Nintendo Switch. I play usingJoy-Cons with adapters I bought a fewweeks ago along with the original Joycongrip, but let's be honest, Joyconsaren't great. So, I bought this cheapbut awesome Power A controller with aCharizard design. Considering the priceand features, it's a great great option.To take my gaming setup to the nextlevel, I also added lighting.Especially, I installed light barsbehind the monitor from a brand calledit Goovy. These lights completelytransform the vibe of the setup, and youcan customize the colors and brightnesshowever you like. Finally, let's talkabout the two wall shelves. The firstone is decorated with my One Piececollection, a manga, a Trafagalo FunkoPop, and a soro figure. As you probablynoticed, I'm a huge fan of One Piece andPokémon, but my top favorite has alwaysbeen Dragon Ball. I'm currentlysearching for the best Vegeta figure Ican find. I also keep some photos of mylittle nister behind the decoration. Onthe second shelf, I have a Senitu figurefrom the Slayer, a Zelda amiibo, andanother figure that I honestly don'tknow the name of. And if you recognizeit, please let me know in the comments.I also have a small artificial plant.And in the back, I keep some gift andlittle reminders from my girlfriend. So,that is for today's video. I hope youlike it and enjoyed the tour. If youhave any questions, feel free to drop acomment down below. Don't forget tosubscribe and I will see you in the nextone. Chowo chow.","very nice setup brother

Let's connect on any of my other socials for more theme park content, jelly cats and merch hunts!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/timeasmiles/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@timeasmiles\n\nBusiness Inquiries: timeasmiles@gmail.com\n","Here's my full office tour. It'sdefinitely not done. Very empty shelves,but I kind of wanted this to be abefore. And I've been getting a couplerequests on where I've gotten everythingfrom. I thought we would do that today.And then literally my PC parts come in afew days. And then next time you'll seeme, we'll probably be building the PCtogether, which oh, I'm so excited. I'vesaved for this PC for so long. I thoughtthis was so funny. So, I'm kind of Ithink I'm kind of starting to switchmore toward at home cozy lifestyle,gaming, reading, hobby stuff. I know Ihave been since January already on here.I think I'm starting to switch over onTik Tok and Instagram, too, which isreally exciting. But on here, we'llstill be doing all of the cozy stuff,but then we'll also be doing like littlevlogs. If I go out to theme parks or umhang out with friends, then you'll becoming along. I think I want to make myentire existence as cozy and stressfreeas physically possible because I do nothandle stress very well. What I thoughtwas really funny is when I still livedin my apartment 3 years ago and I wasbuilding my gaming setup, I initiallywanted to go with an all white verysterile gaming setup and I was going tostart like a gaming tech channel. So, ifI can find that footage where I didthat, I'll put that in here. So, you'llsee me from three years ago actuallyhaving filmed and edited this wholevideo and then chickened out and I neverposted it. So, I'll put that video inkind of toward the end just as like afun little bonus clip. But, let's getinto everything on my desk first andthen we'll kind of go around the room.So, my two monitors are the same. Theyare 27 in VS Sonic Elite gamingmonitors. The exact like model number ornumber that they have in the name isXG270Q. I don't know if they still sellthem. They're 165 Hz monitors. Then themonitor arm is actually from Amazon. Iwas gonna go with a really expensivearm, but I decided to get a cheaper armfirst because it had such good reviewsand I was like, well, the nice arm thatI really did want was like $300. It'samazing. It's actually amazing. It likemy monitors, they jiggle if I move mydesk, but like barely. If I'm just likewriting something on my desk, they don'tmove or anything. They keep their place.They have not fallen or like sagged atall yet. My current keyboard that I'musing is actually from Amazon as well.I'll try to have everything linked, bythe way, in case you want to getanything. But this current one fromAmazon that I have, I have not modded. Ididn't even change the key caps on thisone because frankly, it didn't need it.Like these, this keyboard is so heavyand so nice that it doesn't even needmodding, which is insane. The mouse thatI have is a Glorious mouse. I like thismouse a lot. It's very comfortable andvery light. The actual mouse pad thatI'm using, I actually got from Printull,I think it's called. I couldn't find acolor that I was thinking of in mousepads. I looked on Etsy. I looked onAmazon. I looked a bunch to at a bunchof places. I found a color that I reallyliked, just like a swatch, a colorswatch. I ended up going to Printull anduploading that color. And I put it onthis mouse pad and I ordered it and itcame and I love it. So that's a hack foryou. If you ever want a mouse pad, butyou can't find the one you like, justdesign it yourself and print it from aplace like Printull. I saw someone havethis phone stand charger and I fell inlove. And so I was like, ""Okay, I feellike I could 3D print that."" I took ascreenshot of it and then I did my best.I went into Solid Works and I designedit myself in Solid Works and then I gotthe filament and I 3D printed it on ourprinter. When I tell you it took so manytrial and errors to get the actualdesign and the 3D model correct, it wasit took so long. There was also a lot oftrial with like the weight and how andto make sure that it wouldn't like fallover or anything. This little light Igot from Amazon. I don't know if I wouldrecommend this light though. It's kindof eh I just have it on here foraesthetics, but I feel like there arebetter ones out there. It came with aremote, but it doesn't even reallychange colors very well. It doesn't haveany cute warm color options. So, I don'tknow if I would recommend that one, butjust in case you really need thatspecific one, I I have it. This clock Ifound at Five Below. I don't know how tolink that, so I don't think I will, butI'm sure you can find it anywhere. Andthen this fake plant I got from IKEA.And then the planter I got from HomeDepot. The Nintendo Switch, obviously,if you want to watch the video where Ibought the Nintendo Switch and unboxedit, that's in the previous video. Andthen the skins and the thumb grips Iactually got from a small businesscalled Sticky Tech. I love them. Andthen this mug that I use all the timehere cuz it just matches the fall vibeaesthetic, cozy aesthetic, uh, isactually from, I think, HomeGoods. Andthen the little coaster is from Etsy.The top of my desk is actually from theIKEA kitchen countertop section. Thenthe the drawers that it's sitting on arethe Alex drawers. And then I have thispegboard that I still need to put up onmy wall, also from IKEA. And then thelittle things on the pegboard that areholding up my flashlight and myheadphones, my boyfriend designed and 3Dprinted them. Then behind me are thesebeautiful shelves that I just got andthey're from Target. I've been eyeingthem for so long. I actually consideredgetting them as a bookcase before I hadbought my actual bookcase, but they werenever on sale and they're like $400. Icaught them on sale. They were like over$100 off. I had to get them immediately,so I snatched them. The light on it,this round light is from IKEA. And thenthis other light is also from IKEA. Andthen all the rest of the ambiancelighting that's stuck to like mymonitors, the back of my desk, that'sall go lighting. And then behind methere's also a fake olive tree andthat's also from Amazon. And then behindthat is a Goi corner lamp also fromAmazon. Okay, so now plans for theoffice, right? So I already have it inmy Etsy cart. I just need to order it. Ihave some pictures that I want to put atthe top. And then I just need a bunchmore knickknacks. So, if there are anylike small businesses that you thinksell really cute knickknacks or placesthat I should go or think places I couldfind little tiny things to decorate myshelves. And then obviously I want toput stuff on the walls like if I'm goingto be filming at this angle, I needsomething like over here. And I'mthinking maybe like another poster.Yeah, I'm thinking like a picture oranother poster or a neon sign orsomething fun up there. And then up hereI'm going to put my pegboard. And then Iwant to do little lights. I also want toput up some more like I want to put up aton of stuff. I'm also consideringputting back my curtains from before,but all my desk is already here and I'dhave to move everything. So, I'm notsure if I really want to do that or if Ijust want to leave it. Honestly, that'sit. That's my entire office. Let me showyou my library. Okay, I need a secondbookcase like immediately. IKEA has beensold out of this style of bookcase. So,this is the very basic IKEA bookcase,and I need a second one cuz I have somemore books coming in. This rug is fromAmazon. This reading chair is fromAnthropology. The blanket is fromTarget. And then the pillows came withthe chair, but the covers are fromAmazon. The light is also from Amazon,but the bulb in it is from Goi. Themirror my friend was moving and shedidn't need it anymore, so she gave itto me. And then I have all of theseframes and all of these prints that Istill need to buy. Making a wholegallery wall on this wall. I justactually have to press buy on my Etsycart cuz they're all in there. All theprints are in there. Some of them aredigital. Some of them are actual prints.I just need to actually buy it and Ineed to pull the trigger. And I thinkall the prints that I need for thisoffice and for the ones in my libraryare like$170 total. Again, some digital, somenot. I know that's probably not thatmuch. It's kind of a lot at the sametime. So, I'm waiting till I get paidagain. Next payday, I'm getting it.We'll do an updated one where we'll havethe gallery wall. If you're watchingthis and you are looking for inspo,you're looking to kind of get yourgaming setup going, just know that thiswas not an overnight thing. Like, did Igo on shopping rampages every once in awhile and get like three things at once?Sure, it's okay for your office to notbe aesthetic. the amount of cables thatare just around my desk right nowbecause I have to use this complicateddocking system and I have to use my oldcomputer that's literally about toexplode every time I turn it on until Ihave my PC which I've been saving my formy PC for a long time and I've toldmyself that once I get my PC I'll get mycable management in order and like untilthen it's just been cables everywhereugly ugly ugly cables that's okay It'sokay to not have the absolute perfectmost aesthetic setup. Anyway, withoutfurther ado, let's watch the first evertech video that I made and then neverposted[Music]it. Welcome to Tim Tech. I'm Tim and I'mgoing to be building my very firstsetup.I want fast refresh rate for when I dostart gaming like on a PC. Um cuz rightnow I just game on like my PlayStation.I also wanted good color grading. If youhave done any research about monitors,you'll basically know that everyonetells you you can't do both. You can'thave high refresh rate and have goodcolor grading. But I found this one. Ithink it came out like around 2 yearsago. Um but this one basically has agood balance of everything. One littletab. Two little tabs.Oh, BRB. I'm going to flip this over.Here's what the inside of the box lookslike. Everything's a mess. So, let's goahead and start taking everything outpiece by piece. Okay, first piece ofpaper. We've got clips and aninstruction manual, I think. All right.Next, we've got a cable. This looks likethe power cable. Nope, just kidding.Wow, I'm blind. This is the display portcable. And this came likethis. Okay, so this is the monitormount. All right. Okay. Yeah. And themonitor mount is made out of aluminum.It's really nice, actually. I kind oflike it. It's really sleek looking and Ilike that it's aluminum. It just makesit feel more expensive, I guess. Andthen this is what's going to be mountedto the actual monitor. It's got theplate and it's just standard sizing. Andthen this actually they have a grip atthe top so you can carry the monitor.But even the mount is reallyheavy. So now I'm scared how heavy themonitor is. I'm going to set up themount first. This bottom part is goingto go into here with there's like ascrew that's like an easy twisty turnwith like a little handle onit. I'm just going to put thatin.Okay. Done. Okay. So, now let's take outthe monitor.Wow, dirty. Here's what the back lookslike. Here's one. I can't turn this onyet because I need the docking stationthat connects to my Mac. Okay, so someof these have little latchy things orarms so that you can hang your uhheadphones. And then there are alsothese little clips at the bottom to holdyour mouse's uh wire. There's also umRGB lighting on the back, which I didn'treally care about, but it's there.There's kind of a cable managementlittle circle right there. And thenthere is also RGB lighting. I heard andseen in reviews that it's not superstrong, but it gets like a floody glow.So, we can test that out. Let's open upthe keyboard. So, as I mentionedearlier, this keyboard is fromMechanical Keyboards. It's a Ducky 13,and I ended up getting the Cherry MX uhclear switches. I do want to end upmodding it to be with the Boba U4switches, tactile switches, but alsoagain, that's more money. So, I'm kindof splitting things up like every coupleweeks. So, that'll come in the future.And possibly new key caps,too.Here is the box for the duckykeyboard.Wow. And then here is the keyboard.Okay. So, it comes with the key cappullers. It comes with little switchpullers. It comes with a braided cable.That's nice. I like that it's braided.It comes with a white space bar becauseI think the space bar on here is like auh printed one that they put on. Andthen it comes with some extra key caps,some purple key caps. That's cool. Iknow that if you get a colored one, theygive you a little um a couple differentvariations of colors you can choose fromfor your keyboard. Oh, yes. It'sbeautiful. Wow. It's actually a lotheavier than I thought for being plastickeyboard. It also has like these chromeor silver sides, which I think would gonice like if I end up getting otheraccessories that are white based.Normally, they'll pair them with achrome or like silver accenting. Andthen it has this like tiger space bar onit. And then one of the purple key caps.All right, let's go set this up on mydesk. Okay, so this is what I'mcurrently working with. This Alex deskis what I have from IKEA. And then Inormally have a second table right hereto make like an Lshaped desk, which iswhat all the monitors and keyboard arestanding on right now. So, I'm justgoing to wipe this off and then we'regoing to put everything onit. Well, I would like this ideally bein the center. My boyfriend's printer istaking up real estate on my desk. Okay,give me a second. Let me Let me figurethis out. Okay, here's how it looksright now. Basically, this is the entirelength of mydesk. Everything will eventually bewhite. Also, don't this is not going tobe a satisfying build my setup cablemanagement. Everything is perfect. Thisis going to be a step-by-step process.I'm going to plug everything in and thensee how the lights look, see howeverything looks, and I will show youguys how that looks. And then we're justgoing to kind of chill here and waituntil more stuff comes. So, I do reallylove this purple, though. I'm not goingto lie. But I want it all white. So,let's change the key cap really quick.It always givesme anxiety to take these out cuz I'mscared I'm going to breakit. Should we do a sound test, guys?Okay. I don't have a separate mic, sothis is as close as I can get while alsofilming.So, they're pretty clacky and clicky,and I like more of a silent or likethick sounding key. So, I do like theactuation force on these a lot. And Iand I I think I like heavy keys, but Ialso heard that if you're gaming, likeyour fingers can get tired a lot fasterbecause it obviously requires a lot moreforce. Again, this coloring literallybothers me so much, but this uh patternis cool. Okay, here is mylaptop. Currently has like a white vinylon it. Ignore how dirty it is. I thoughtwe could connect the keyboard at leastto my laptop and see how that goes. Thecable even has a little cover. That'scute. Oh, that sound wassatisfying.Wow. Well, it looks pretty cool. I'm notgoing to lie. Your keyboard cannot beidentified and will not be usable untilit is identified. Press the keyimmediately to the right of the shiftkey. Press the key immediately to theleft of the shiftkey. Your keyboard has been identified.Click done to start using your computer.If this isn't the correct type for yourkeyboard, select type and click done.United States. It's United States. Okay.So, let's go into likeWord. I will never use my work laptopkeyboard again. It works.But now, how do I change the colors?Okay, the frame rate is off slightly, sothat's why it looks like it'sflickering, but this is like breathingmode. I I chose this color, by the way.Um, then there's like just stagnant. So,again, it's like flickering because theframe rates are off um on the camera andthen on the lights. And then there islike a swirl one. There's this one goesoutward.Then there's a like RGBone. Then there's this one that justkind of also switches through thedifferentcolors. This one I think just goes onrandom colors like just picks randomkeys like awave. And then this one is kind of cool.So whatever you type like, ""Hi, my nameis Tim.""It like illuminates those keys for likea little bit and then it does the samething but with onecolor. Okay. I had to spin the monitoraround to reach theport. Okie dokie. Artich chokey. We'renot doing any cable management, so Idon't even want to hear it. Okay. Wow,it works. And look, you can see the RGBunderneath. That is actually prettybright. Yeah, it is. So to have both ortwo monitors connected to a MacBookthrough a docking station, you need todownload driver for it. So let's I'mgoing to test the other monitor and thenthat'll probably be it for today. If allgoes well, you won't hear from me untilthe docking station comes in. And then Ialso the goal is to kind of get a littlePC mount underneath the desk. And I alsowant to obviously get white cables. Iwant to cable manage. And then obviouslylike I'm saying just like slowly startgetting accessories to make it a fullstation. So for now that's going to beit. That's going to be the mostimportant things aside from a PC for mystation. So I'll see you whenever thedocking station comes in. Anyway, that'sit. That's all I wanted to say. Um andthat's my little office setup. I can'twait to look back at this video and seehow much farther I've progressed in afew months, in the next year, two years,whatever. I can't wait to look back onthis. Stay tuned for the PC building.Stay tuned for streaming cozy games andif you want to follow along on like lifestuff that this is where to do that cuzon Tik Tok doing more curated videos,but on here it's going to be more chillvibbey lifey stuff. So, thank you so somuch for watching. I love you. Bye.[Music][Music]","Animal crossing in this room would be amazing!

Heat.[Music]so this is what it's looking like rightnow. The plant that I showed youearlier, I put this up. Didn't know whatto put in here, so I kind of just putsome plushies in there just to fill itout. The setup itself is pretty similarto the one in my previous room. Thisroom gets like a lot more lighting, Iwould say, than my previous room. Ignoremy dead plants. So, I'm really excitedto create content in here. And also, I'mworking on stuff like uh around my roomhere. I will also film this and makevideo on it. So, my cable managementright now is it's doing the job for now,but I definitely want to clean this up abit more, find out where to put thisone. But, it works for now. Uh does thejob. And you can't really see it likewhen I'm creating content fromhere. I had to pause cuz I got mydominoes. It's pretty empty still likearound here. So, I'm planning on maybedoing some hanging plants or somethinghere. And I also want to put up my RGBpanels like the triangle ones.

We bought an ENTIRE Gaming Setup from Temu, to see if you could actually game on it! But we didnt stop there, because we also ordered 1 star snacks and entire mystery package! \n\nDont forget to follow me here: Beacons.ai/samsonjc22\n\nBusiness Inquiries = Samsonjcgaming@gmail.com \n\n#Gamingsetup #gamingroom #Temu",UCUWNrLK2BSYPSpuLV4Rq7ww,@samsonjc22,美国,139000,53560294,455,2017/5/19 0:00,💪🏻 | Tech & Gaming\n⏰ | Gaming House Dude\n📧 | SamsonJCgaming@gmail.com,"This is a one-star reviewed PC I boughtfromTeeu. And since Teeu is known for theirhighquality products, I'm puttingtogether an entire gaming setup entirelyfrom their one-star reviewed item to seeif this tech really is reviewedunfairly. Why do you have a map of myhouse and the appraisal value from theassessor's website? But to make thishappen, we need a three-step plan.First, we have to shop for a one-startag. Second, we have to unbox our tech,assuming we're not scammed, and finallywe have to test it all out to see how itworks. Now, with us searching forone-star products on the website, Teimu,this should be no problem at all. So,we're going to be gaming monitor. I'm alittle scared on what's going to pop up.One star and up. Someone is sandbaggingthese reviews cuz we have five star,four star, five star. There is no waythis could be a problem, boys. Aftersearching for longer than what Iexpected, we have found our first unitright here. We havetheGolf 2427 IPS gaming monitor coming inat 1080p 100 hertz refreshrate. $133. Very bad return process andvery bad customer service. Add to cart.Next one on here, gaming keyboard. Okay,guys. Teemo actually has the sales. So,not only are we getting a RGB gamingkeyboard, but also an RGB gaming mousefor a scorching$14.7. Arrived broken and inpieces. Oh, what did I do? Add the card.Of course, of course, we need we needsomewhere to put our entire gamingsetup. So, I wish I could spell gamingdesk. Don't worry, this one may not havethe gaming theme that we were lookingfor, but it is a ergonomic standingdesk. This is the 1/2 pieces 55 inelectronic standing desk coming in witha one-star review. Never got the packageand they refused to give me a refund.Starting to see a common theme here. I'mgetting a little nervous, but we'readding the cart. 73% off. But what I maybe most excited about is what kind ofgaming chair can we get off the world oftame. Oh, here it is. Heavyduty 400 lb.So, we can barely fit on this thing. RGBLED gaming chair. This is 400 lb. No,no, no. Before you assemble this item,make sure that the parts are complete,especially the remote. Little confusedat the English comprehension on thatone. I don't know. That screams youraesthetic. everything I've gleaned aboutyour personality. Add to cart. To holdit all down, we got the most importantpart of our entire setup, the gaming PC.Gosh dang it. We have had such a hardtime finding one-star products off ofTeimu, except when it comes to ourgaming PC, which is probably the mostimportant centerpiece in the entiregaming setup. We got the STG Aubrongaming desktop PC. It's coming in with aRadeon RX 580, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM, 1 TBSSD, and some RGB fans. One star. Thereview shipping was very fast, but is aChristmas present, so I will updatereview when I hook it up. Comma. Videocard don't work. Not cool. When aChristmas gift does not work, that'swhat you get for buying your PC off ofTeeu. Add to cart. After finalizing ourPC setup items, we might as well go allin with our looks and decoration. I'vebeen hearing about these mystery boxesoff a team. It is $8.68 saying ultimatesurprise gift over 30 fun and uniqueitems to choose from. But when I go downto the one-star reviews, I'm I'm sensinga common theme here. I got a cheap watchand a flashlight. I end up receiving 99cent storewatch and a $2 flashlight. Imean, with this mystery box, I hope I'mnot getting a cheap watch and aflashlight, which came out to a total of$960. But did everything get delivered?Well, that brings us to step two.unboxing what is hopefully all of ourtech. Well, boys, our massive Teimudelivery is now here. But I have somegood news. And I have some bad news. Asyou can see, we have most of our gamingsetup delivered. The bad news is we aremissing our speakers, RGB clouds, andour mouse pad. It said it was supposedto be here 4 days ago. Our gaming setupmay be a little lacking. You're gettingscammed. Too's not a scam. And just toremind you guys, not only did we get onestar reviewed gaming setup products, butwe also did get one star reviewed mints.Wow,that's so minty. It's only 40 millig, soit's like half a cup of coffee.Before we could even unbox anything, wealready ran into our first red flag. Amap of my house. That is crazy. I stilldon't understand why you're pulling upthe appraisal amount on my home and thenputting it on the box. I think they'rein my walls. Honestly, I respect thededication, Timu, but that won't stop usfrom unboxing our first item, our 55-instanding desk. What is that sturdy? Now,off the bat, this desk is looking alittle off. Supposedly, this can hold154 lbs, but I'm scared to even put agaming setup on this. I have a meetingtomorrow morning at 9:00. Do you thinkyou could have that one finished up bythen? This screw? Yeah, I think so.So, the onestar review, the good thingisthey never got the package and theyrefused to give the refund. The goodnews is we did get the package. The badnews is that color looks a little bitdifferent than this, wouldn't you say?Like, look at that. It's like a lightwood. We got to plug it in to see if itactually works and goes up and down. Allright. Does it ascend?Hey, hooray.Now the question is how much weight.That motor definitely slowed down. Turnsout this thing actually works prettysolid for 100 bucks. But now it's timeto get into the fun stuff. Wait, so ifthat was the desk and this is the gamingchair, what is in this big one? It's ourmystery box. And it's very, verydelicate and it's important we're savingit towards the end. So, first up, wehave our computer monitor from, pardonmy French here, go folk. We are comingin with 27 in, get this, super monitor.Don't quite know what a super monitoris. We got our monitor stand. Ooh, I gotto say, they gave me a display portinstead of HDMI. And the best is yet tocome, boys.Ready? So, we got a 27 in, but it is acurved monitor. On the bottom, we dohave an HDMI, you got a display port,you got USB, and of course, your power.The last thing we need to do is then putthis on itsstand. Have you seen the screw for thisthing? But Joel, we got to give thepeople what theywant. How is that for anASMR? This is a dynamic stand, you know.Yeah, it's great angles. But how doesthis monitor compare to the review sofar? Very bad return process and verybad customer service. Again, thatdoesn't really tell me how the monitorworks, but we're about to find out. Oh,is that the screw? Found the screw. Wegot the Vaude Durk GT100 Luminous RGBkeyboard and mouse. But let's go aheadand open this. The the box seems to haveseen better days. Now, I'm a littleworried because again, my boy Deborahover there said this arrived broken andin pieces. I hate to break it to you,Deborah, but my keyboard did not come inpieces. Yeah, this is going to be alittle rough. I mean, for 15 bucks, whatcan you expect? Except it even has aspring in the keyboard. I don't thinkI've ever seen that. Of course, youalways have your switch behind it, butan actual spring. But mouse. Oh,sorry. Little rough on the clicks. Butthe one thing that I'm a littledisappointed about is all my gaming micehave the two buttons here on the sidethat I use for like back and forwardwhen I'm scrolling the worldwide web.And this one does not have that. So,we're limited to a left click, rightclick, and the scroll wheel. But again,for 15 bucks, I mean, how much more canyou ask for? All right, boys. And thethird one, hold on. All right, boys. Andfor the third one, we have get this bigand tall gaming chair, which I mean,honestly, between us is perfect.Now, I will say I don't think I've everhad a gaming chair with RGB. Oh my gosh,dude. I forgot we did the pink one. Ohmy gosh, dude.Ho. Good boy. Ho free dog. Does thisthing have speakers on it? Why are theyfacing away from you and not where you'dbe sitting? It's called surround sound,Quinn. Oh, I'm sorry. But this issupposed to be new, boys. I have somedirt marks already on the chair.Ah, yeah. Like your normal gaming chairslike the Secret Labs and stuff likethat, you're going to be paying $400 to$500. But for 150 bucks, you're gettingsurround sound, RGB, and slightly used.Great. Now, much to my surprise, thisgaming chair has some pretty specialfeatures. You can't tell me. Holdon. Why is it Why is it all scuffed upalready? Why is it bros never satbefore? Oh, found it. Wow. I mean, howdoes the stability on the leg thinglook? Cuz it feels like when I put mylegs on it that it's going to snap. Butafter piecing together most of oursetup, it's time to plug in the mostvaluable piece of tech of them all.Normally PCs are a little more densethan this. We say one thing. We orderoff a team for a reason. Okay. Beingmade in Canada, isn't it? Okay. If wejust remember, we weren't going to getspeakers, mouse pad, and RGB cloud. AndI did not know this, but they didinclude a mouse pad with the PC. Dude,we even got a mouse in that looks eerilysimilar to each other. Which one'scooler? The white and blackone. What? Well, here is the main event.It's so small. Our boy here said heordered a Christmas present and hisChristmas kit no longer works. And Ithink it was the graphics card, but 9600GPU, 16 gigs of RAM. Oh my god, thislooks like a toy. Two RGB fans righthere. Another RGB fan, two RGB fans uphere. Dude, look at this thing. What isthis piece of RAM from my miscellaneousPC parts that I will eventually use.This is what RAM here in the UnitedStates looks like. This is the RAM wegot off of T-Moon. We are getting 16gigs. I'm going to have to go doublecheck our screenshots. I know this isthe real moment of truth and what youguys are herefor. Look at that. I mean, I bet he hasjust like great personality. I mean, helooks cute. I want to give you guys aquick comparison of PCs. Okay, look atthat thing. That's like Don't talk to meor my son ever again. Now, before weturn the entire PC setup on, it is themoment of truth. Now, if you guysremember, we end up finishing off theordering segment with a mystery gift. Imean, we could be getting a watch, aflashlight, or maybe mean even a PS5. Weneed to see what we ended up getting.This is the mystery box. Wow. That isquite some shipping. Are you serious?This is it, boys. What did they say?There was a bunch of reviews. It waseither a flashlight or a watch. What arewe hoping for? I mean, a flashlightwould be sick.Ooh, suck. 401.This is definitely not worth the onestarreview. Dude, look at that thing. Andit's got, I'm guessing, 400 games builtinto one. So, we're going to be pluggingthis in. We're going to be giving it agood charge and see what games are onit. Dude, that's a little overkill for abox for that thing. Yeah, dude. Now,this may be the kicker that seals thisentire setup off.No, we're running with that. Oh, doesthis a smell? Oh my gosh. But this issupposed to be 50 ft of RGB that we'regoing to use in our setup. Now, you maybe looking at the setup right nowsaying, ""There's not 50 ft worth of RGBin there."" Oh, yes, there is. Four bucksis not bad. But we haven't turned it onyet, so I better not speak. Now that wehave finished steps one and two, it isnow time for the most important part ofthe build, which is step three, testingit all out. It's the moment of truth.Whoa. Why is it vibrating?Okay. Honestly, I'm impressed that firstof all, the chair turned out and secondof all, the PC turned on. Exciting. Oh,no. Wait, the rope light. This ropelight. It was going to look so aestheticand not like a crime scene at all. Oh,wait. Why are they on the same remote?Oh, the PC and the chair controllingboth at once. I click red and thatchanges to green. I go green, thatchanges to purple. Question is, do Iwant this PC to be able to connect to myWi-Fi? I mean, they already know youraddress. That's true. They know myappraisal value on my house, so whatmore do they need? We got the PC on.Thankfully, I did not see this. Italready comes with Windows alreadydownloaded. So, all I had to do is enterall my personal information, socialsecurity number, credit card info. Forsome reason, they wanted my mother'smaiden name. But now that we goteverything downloaded, what we're goingto be doing is going on the worldwideweb with Wow, what is the sensitivity onthis thing? And we're going to bedownloading some Marvel rivals to seehow this thing holds up,bro. It's actually kind of loud. Now,Marvel Rivals has taken years todownload, so we're testing a differenthighmaintenance game on this PC for thetime being. Dude, I'm going for thatequalizer. says I'm 38th right now.Yeah, right. Wow, you're just belowQuebec.Oh, well, that game lasted about 32seconds. Now, I know it's been weighingon you guys' mind since we've beendownloading Marvel Rivals. How is thesub 400 games in one doing? Andhonestly, was there a power button? No.Oh, we want to go for English, right?Oh, yeah. So, you have everything fromSuper Mario, Mario 14, Mario 13, Dr.Mario, Mario Bros., Turtles. You haveDonkey Kong 1, 2, and 3 and Junior.My gosh.Gosh. Good game. For what was this? $8for a mystery thing. Yeah. Everyone wasupset because all they advertised wastechnology. Tech Game Boy games. Andeveryone was getting a watch and aflashlight. Like a $2. Exactly. Thisthing might be the biggest steal of ourordering, but it's Marvel Rivals time.Let's go. My favorite part is how thescreen keeps going black.Like that. Yeah. Oh my gosh, dude. It'sfrozen.Oh my god. Connected. Oh yeah. Oh.Oh my gosh. It's so loud. Oh my gosh.Punisher is on nothing right now. Yeah,he is. He's just chilling there, youknow. We are getting 70 to 80 fps on a1080p monitor. And again, this is out ofgame. Now we've dropped down to like 6465ish in game. So even with this monitorat 180 Hz refresh rate, you can't evenuse that to the full capabilities cuzyou're maxed out at 60. But let's seewhat actually happens when you get likeinto a battle scene. Yeah, that workedout well. 48 FPS. It's great. How's thekeyboard and mouse hold? Um it's alittle slippery without something, youknow? I'm just so glad that I get tolisten to the game through my chair.That's probably my favorite part.Temperature on the PC is still good.Like fans are keeping this nice and cooleven though the PC is struggling.There's a little heat on the top, so Ifigured that's where the exhaust fansare. Standing, sitting, pink chair,speakers, doesn't matter. I can tellyour mouse is getting stuck a lot. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But at the end of theday, is the Teimue Tech here reallyworth the onestar review? All right.Rapid fire review. Chair, I'm going togive this a four out of five. It wasgoing to be a three out of five, butjust because they put in a massagingback rest, we're going to give them afour out of five. So, we got to givethem that extra star. Mouse andkeyboard. I got to give that like 1.5out of five. Now, I know both of thesecombined was only $15, but they werevery, very difficult to use. Now,monitor overall, actually, this is goingto be quite a steal. I got to give this4.5 out of five on the stars. It wouldhave gotten a 10. I just couldn't findthe screw in the beginning, and that'sdefinitely not my fault. Now, when itcomes to the desk, the desk overall, Imean, for a little over 100 bucks, I'mgoing to give this one a 3.5 out offive. I don't like the dividing naturedown the middle right there. If theywould have sealed that, it would havebeen like a 4.5 out of five. What couldyou ask for for you know a little over100 bucks? Now the PC. Why are youtouching it like that? Okay, dude.Honestly, I'm going to give this afourst star rating out of five. Now, Iknow it struggled on Marvel Rivals alittle bit and a Gario. And a Gario. Butwhen you think of a $400 PC that alsocomes with a mouse, keyboard, and mousepad, may I let you know? You're probablyunder $400 for this PC. And still to beable to play Marvel Rivals on that, Imean, that's pretty killer. Now, would Iuse something like this PC? No, Iwouldn't. So, the Teimu setup was goodoverall, but if you want to see what asetup like this looks like from Walmart,you can check that video out here. So, Iappreciate you guys, and we'll see youon the next one.[Music]","10:40 2 RAM sticks are identical if you remove the heatsink
Nah my broke ass would be using this setup
Two things I saw. The monitor was 100Hz refresh rate yet you received a 180Hz, and the GPU stated it was an RX580 16GB. There is no such thing as a RX580 with 16GB. They were made with only 4GB or 8GB configurations. Great video! Enjoyed it!
The ram was funny cause I bet that the big white corsair is just the same stick as the other. They made them taller to make it easier to sit in smaller boards now that pcs are very tight and no longer huge.
That huge box for that little 400 in 1
A temu ad just popped up
Don’t talk to me or my son ever again got me rolling 11:02
“It’s called surround sound quin.” Best line in the vid.
10:55, you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
4:20 I thought the desk wasn’t gonna show but hey I was wrong it showed up
The turning on the pc part scared me lol
That's actually not bad
The screen suddenly turning off while playing a game is simply caused by the keyboard you bought. My friend has the same problem. The same thing happens to him. If you change the keyboard, this problem will not occur.Good video i enjoyed that
It's been a pretty long time since I last watched your videos. You're so underrated, the video quality is so good for someone with 131k subs
i sold DDR 3 monster with 16GB, ASUS 970 pro gaming AURA, SSD and RX 580 for only 200$ last year
Yo I thought this video had like 24k likes, heavily underrated video
bro yoi look like the lost brother of Vitaly.
I say this with all my sincerity, you have a very good YouTube channel
Better than my 500 dollar aliexpress pc (ryzen 5 5600x, 32gb ram, GT 1030)
It looks like this temu set up looks better than my set up ️
At least the monitor has the ""Tilt function for smooth gaming"". Because we all know not being able to tilt your monitor is almost always the cause of latency and stutters in games.
9:45 did you just use a GPU to open the box LOL
Can u show us the true specs of the pc when u got it please ?
If you don’t want it I would lovely take it to start with my gaming channel
oohhh, mystery boxes...*breaks out my shovel and digs my grave* Remember, pink is the new blue...
You need to lower the monitors refresh rate for it to stop going black
Wait is that the guy who does backflips
The screen going black issue could be because of a very cheap display port cable. I bought a cheap one once and this is exactly what happened, it even caused my PC to crash
First time seeing your video, instantly subscribed. The review was so damn put together and y'all were so funny 
Highly underrated
that case is kind of nice and small footprint
i started watching your video, and temu ad popped up
I don’t know if u have a 5 stars build from temu, but I want to see it
Very underrated
8:17 GAMING CHIAR
Call me crazy but that leg-rest on the chair might actually come in handy if used by a small kid who cant reach the floor.
i like when he said his favourite mouse is the black and white one
Wait zealouss best friend?
Buyer : bad product, doesn't even turn on 
Him : add to cart
can bet mine is worse
6:18 I see what you did there “gofawk yourself 🫵”
Mann!! I Love it when He do that funny pose 4:25
Anyone notice how all the options say local due to the tariffs temu had now gone down the drain
Came out of nowhere with high quality video damn
14:29 I HAVE THIS
The desk was a 2 star review from a 1 star seller.
In our region ALL Temu listings have 5 Star and great reviews like it is fake for all products,
Good to know in other region there is honest rated products of temu
I really need something like this atleast for now
Would you mind Please give me your personal computer because I need it for my studies.
I hope their slogan is: Gawfalk yourself!
The moment bro gave that reaction with that ram I instantly knew he does not know a lot about pcs. Those who know knows what I'm talking about
11:43 wait a minute I have the exact same one but yellow, got it a gift from my grandma
Marvel rival's could have ran better if the ram was upgraded to dual channel
6:29 asus monitors include dvi also. Who use dvi anyway
nice vid ! btw u say 60 fps is pretty good while im playing roblox with everything off on 50 fps ;-;
I just subscribed. And This was well edited, and made me laugh
This channel is underrated!
That chair is shockingly cute
$400 for a PC with a RX 480 is quite pricey. :)
They probably sell those cards for $50 on eBay second hand, which is without a doubt where it came from lol.
Ihave the same system unit
Your gaming setup is better than mine,oww i forgot i don't have one
That temu pc is far better than ma core i5 from 2012 3rd gen nice video btw
Did my guy really just open the pc box with a gpu lmao
Ngl I would take that set up like it's my dream set up better than my phone
This is the highend pc in our country
Yeh
Sadly temu dont have pcs in my country.
I wanted to see what PCs they have xD
Did TEMU got sponsor all of this just for a video? That would be more interesting to know about it.
More temu pls but with good stuff like good quality stuff. Like good keybord and mouse
For 1000$ on Temu you can buy PC on Threadripper 7995WX and 4 RTX 5090.
Can I have that?
Albino u on Crack for buying this 1 star junk
Bro used the GPU to open the box
why you unboxed it with a grafiks card
can i have that pc?
Try 1000$ microcenter
I love you guys
Need the link for gaming table
This is peak PC
bro, just give me that graphics card instead of turning it into a boxcutter HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Gaming chair is crazy lil bros
I think why is the PC is not working is because it’s from another country and the electricity is way more powerful than the United States

Eureka has also includedslots in the tabletop for propping upyour tablet or smartphone, makingmultitasking a breeze.

Adding this desk to my Amazon wish list... thank you for a great review coverage video, it helped me decide!
very nice love the fact u got to do a budget desk def good to hear about it so thank you
Love the intro!
Great vid, man!!! May I ask where you got that wallpaper on your desktop? <3 Absolutely gorgeous!
Hi! How to turn Off that glowing in control panel? It's so annoying at night's, especially in bedroom
why did you put budget in your title this is high end expensive . putting budget in your title makes it seem like its going to be a budget desk
Since when is a $600 desk “budget friendly”?

You utilize the L-Shape desk to its fullest! Great dual setup, looking forward to the makeover vid.
We've been waiting for this for a while! That gaming setup is sick, I love the monitor.
The L Shape desk looks cool! Awesome new setup man!
Fire setup brother!!
Let’s go!!! Finally, something I can watch while I have my lunch today
devastated I can't get Vernal gear here in Australia! it all looks gorgeous.
Dope setup my guy!
I am also setting Myntrading office and set up. Great video
The mini fridge is a must for me lol
I would potentially wait on the Studio Display to see if Apple announces a new one at WWDC, or alternatively to see what other manufacturers come up with on the 5K alternatives this year. It's what I'm doing. My current monitor works just fine for me, I'll wait until at least 90Hz minimum comes en masse to 5K.
That monitor is ART
Nice video love it on my way my desktop setup this year
if you're into manifestation but feeling confused by all the different methods out there... this book Vibrations of Manifestation explains everything through actual quantum mechanics. started yesterday and already seeing things differently. the frequency method makes so much sense when you understand the science behind it. finally feel like I get how this actually works
Great video! Keep the awesome stuff coming
Starting my youtube channel soon, unfortunately, I'll need to steal your entire setup, this is impeccable! Don't worry, I'll use your affiliate links lol!
Never understood why any L-shaped standing desks have one side shorter than the other. Just make them with equal sides.
The Apple logo on your MacBook looks so real. Like so realistic
just a heads up, you already know this probably but don't leave your oled monitor on for aesthetic due to their burn in tendencies
I feel like you can get a better monitor than that. 5k resolution doesn't mean squat, and you have other options for webcam and speakers
Seeing a thermoelectric fridge hurts my soul. That thing probably uses as much electricity as your whole gaming rig.
Shoutout to Eddie!!
Looks amazing! What are the desk dimensions?
meditation teacher here. been studying manifestation for years but the way Vibrations of Manifestation explains it through quantum physics is completely different. it fills in all the gaps in traditional manifestation teaching. seeing my students get clarity they never had before. this book is genuinely helping people understand how reality creation actually works
What is the large rectangular light on your productivity setup?
What is the monitor riser and MacBook dock you are using? I like that they both go with the desk!
Bro, this is insane! Could you quickly calculate the total cost of all of them?
Link to wall slats?
How can I get that live wallpaper you’re using? Looks so cool
This one is for the algorythm
Would you mind linking that arcane wallpaper?
I wish the L shaped desk came in all black
So.................can we get a gallery of the space wallpapers, please???
What are the dimensions of the Vernal desk? Thanks so much!!
Do you happen to know the height of the lower compartments of the side cabinet when the drawers are not installed?
I'm wondering if I can place some ring binders in there which are usually 31.5cm tall.
Would you ever get a Mac mini?
what the mini frigde 
you have
What which size did you get? I'm looking to get the 80 by 72
hey where u get dat wallpaper from
coming from a science background I always thought manifestation was bs. but kept seeing people talk about this book Vibrations of Manifestation. decided to test the quantum field method with small things first. started noticing exactly what the book described - subtle shifts, increased clarity, opportunities I would've missed before. the scientific explanation finally bridges the gap between quantum physics and practical manifestation
looks good, i just dont understand how can someone game on a 16:9 in 2025.... specially when there are awesome oled ultrawide monitors out there......

i mean... if it was me, i'd change that old-school 16:9 granny monitor out immediately, 

otherwise everything else looks good.
Hope U didn't get that 5k monitor. And an iPhone camera is way better quality. Google how to configure it to be a webcam and the best stand to use for it
I wish i wasn't born in lower middle class with such desires...
razer products are sheit, own many all of them all fall apart after some time
ok weird request but can someone who's read Vibrations of Manifestation dm me? started the book last week and have questions about the quantum field chapter... like did anyone else notice their dreams getting super vivid after trying the frequency technique? or am I just trippin lol. need to compare notes because some wild synchronicities happening and none of my friends are into this stuff. first manifestation book that actually explains the science and I'm kinda shook at how it's working

So, basically ahome theater setup. When I moved intothis house about a few months ago, Idecided to carve out a section of thebasement and make that curiosity areality. Now, the goal was reallysimple. It was to optimize the space forthe best possible media experience. Thatmeant adding soundproofing, installingbuilt-in surround sound, creating anultra comfy seating area, and setting upa top tier 4K projector with a versatilemedia setup to match.What is going on, YouTube? So, this isgoing to be my future home theatersetup, um, which I've cut out as a partof my home studio in my basement. So, ifyou haven't seen that video, you can goahead and check it out. Before I goahead and begin adding things to thisspace, I'm going to quickly give youguys a recap of um, everything that'salready in here and how uh, it's all setup. So, first off, this room measuresabout 123 square ft, which is not verylarge by any means, but perfect enoughfor what I need it for. The ceiling inhere has also been dropped um in orderto accommodate some HVAC system that wasup there before. And since this is goingto be a home theater setup, that's okayas well. During the development stage,um I had them insulate or doubleinsulate the walls and the ceiling inhere to make sure that it's assoundproof as possible. So, that's oneof the most important things that youwould want to consider for a hometheater setup is keeping all the soundcontained inside the room. That way youreally get that experience and also soyou don't have to disturb everybodyaround the house. For insulation, whatI've done is used uh 5/8 drywall. I'veused Sonopan which is a 38 um woodmaterial that's designed for uhsoundproofing as well. And I've alsoused rock in wool uh safe and sound. Soit's an it's a fiberglass system that isdesigned to help reduce sound and justgeneral energy loss from the room.Something else I've done here forsoundproofing is add a solid core doorwhich um in comparison to thealternative which is hollow core doorwill prevent sound and energy lossbetter. I also decided to add someweather stripping material around allthe edges to block any uh amount oflight or air from going in and out ofthe room. So that way like I said wekeep everything contained in here. Thelast thing that I've done in here toimprove the sound quality is add somecarpet. So, instead of using LVP, Idecided to go with um a nice carpet,soft uh and has a different design thanwhat you usually see from theconventional style carpets. Now, it'sgot a bit of a pattern all over it, sonothing crazy, but I think, you know, itworks well for this room right here.Now, we don't have much of it in here. Ionly picked up about 15 uh square yardsof it to fill up the entire room, and itworked out great. It fit the entirespace with very, very little wastage.The next thing I'm going to talk abouthere are the speakers in here. So, I'vedecided to go with a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmassystem um to create that reallyimmersive feeling when watching moviesor gaming in here. As you can see onboth sides, I've got the front left andfront right speakers, and I've also gotthe center channel um below at thebottom there. Behind the camera there,I've got two rear speakers, and I've gotsome overhead speakers up top as well.So, that's two, four, six, sevenspeakers in total and a subwoofer. So,the subwoofer isn't in here right now,but I'm going to have it on this side ofthe room, uh, just right there. So, I'vehad it all set up there. It's connectedor hardwired directly to my server rackon the other side. So, everything inhere is essentially hardwired to myserver rack on the other side where I'vealso got my AVR system. As you can see,I've also got some 6in tall baseboardshere. really gives the room uh kind of amore luxurious look, uh taller look.Even though it's already compressed, itgives it that look, which is reallynice. So, something else to note is thelighting that we've got in here. Ididn't do anything special. It's a 14-indual bright surface mount kit. Now, thiskit will allow you to use a dimmerswitch to control the color temperatureof the lights between 2K and 5K. So,warm white and daylight white. And I'vegot a Lutron dimmer switch connected toit in order to be able to do that. Now,check this out. So, right here, I canreduce or increase the temperature aswell as the brightness while uh usingthis light right here. So, somethingthat I really like about this lightright here, but I don't know how longit's going to be here. I might end upchanging it to something more fancy,something more uh extra, somethingthat's got RGB in it. I don't know. Butright now, I think it works out uh wellfor this room. For temperature controlin here, I've decided to go with a smartvent. So, I've got a single 8x 8 insquare vent um installed up there. So,it's a smart vent that connects to thecentral HVAC system that I've got um setup throughout the entire house. Thissystem will close and open the vent oncommand or on demand depending on whenit's needed. So, I've got a littlecontrol puck installed on the wall overthere to allow or enable that feature.This will allow me or anyone in here toeasily uh tweak the temperature to whatthey need it to be, and the vent willclose and open um as needed. I've got acutout in the ceiling on that sidethere, which is um connected to thebathroom. It's kind of a hatch that willgive me access to um a powered overheadshower that I've got in there. I knowit's something that's not common, but Ireally wanted to do that and I neededaccess um to the outlet that powers thatin the bathroom that will be covered upwith something so it will blend into thewall or the ceiling there and will notbe noticeable. The last thing I want tomention is I've got um a flex tube thatgoes across the entire ceiling to theback there. Um passing across HDMI cableand two Ethernet cables. So, Cat 6Ethernet cables and um an HDMI 2.1 uhcable that will allow me to connect theprojector to my AVR in the room behindme. All right, I'm not going to wasteany more time. Let's go ahead and putthis placetogether. After planning out the space,I quickly realized there was no way tofit side tables in the room withouthaving to compromise on the size of thecouch that I wanted. And trust me, thatjust was not an option I was evenremotely willing to consider. I lookedinto compact side table options thatmight work uh with the layout that Ihad, but nothing really hit the mark.Eventually, I decided to take mattersinto my own hands as usual and go theDIY route. While researching, I cameacross a few very clever setups wherepeople used wall shelves or woodenplanks to create DIY side tables. Thatgave me an idea. I picked up two Melanashelves from IKEA, one for each sidewhere the couch would go. These shelvesusually come in a few different colorsand uh two different length options. Formy setup, I needed them to line upneatly with the armrest. So, I went witha smaller size. Since I was alreadygoing the DIY route here, I figured whynot add some extra functionality, too. Ifound these 3-in recessed power gro thatcome with a built-in 15watt wirelesscharger on the surface. The top slidesopen to reveal two AC outlets, a 20 wattUSBC port, and a USB type A port.Basically everything that one would needto charge daily devices. I mean, they'retechnically designed for desks, but thisfelt like the perfect way to repurposethem. They come in black or white, but Ichose white so they blend in seamlesslywith the shelves. I also picked up a few2-in grommets to create passroughs forany cables running from above the shelfto below it, especially since theshelves are going to be mounted flushinto the corner. To start, I laid downpainters tape over the section I plan tocut. Then I used a measuring tape tomark out the exact length that wouldallow the shelves to line up perfectlywith the couch's armrests. Once themarks were in place, I grabbed mycircular saw and made the cuts. Next upwas drilling the grommet holes. Imeasured out the positions on both endsof each shelf. Larger holes for thepower gro and smaller ones for thepassroughs. I then went ahead andswapped in a circular drill bit matchedto the size of the grommets and drilledthrough the marked spots to create theholes. With the shelves prepped, it wastime to mount them. I started with theright hand shelf, marking the height onthe wall and using a long level to drawa straight guideline across the points.Since the Mlander shelf is originallydesigned to display picture frames, Imounted it upside down to get a flatsurface on the top. I mean, it's a sidetable after all. After installing 75lbwall anchors, I aligned the shelf, linedup the pre-drilled holes, and secured itto the wall. Once it felt solid onthere, I installed the power grommet,screwing it in place. It was a snug fitgetting the screw on piece past the lipof the shelf, but it worked. The passthrough grommet on the other side slidin easily since it didn't require ascrew on mount. I went on to repeat thesame process on the opposite side of theroom for the second shelf. Onceeverything was mounted and the Gro werein place, I tested the built-in chargingstations and everything worked asexpected, I was able to wirelesslycharge my key enabled phone both whenthe charger surface was in place andwhen it was slid off. If you knowanything about me or any of my spaces,then you know I'm a big fan of ambientlighting. So, naturally, that was thenext challenge. Since this room wasbuilt around using a projector, I knew Iwanted to keep the lighting minimal andvery intentional. I had some leftoverblack 90 degree LED diffuser channelsfrom previous projects, so I decided torepurpose them here. Each piece came ina fixed length, so I had to cut themdown to fit the vertical space from thetop of the shelves to the ceiling.Starting on the right side, I beganmounting clips to hold the channels inplace. Once I had a good numberinstalled, I slid the channel into theclips and locked it in. Then I moved onto the top piece, which required onefull length uh channel and anothershorter one to fill the remaining space.Before installing that final cut piece,I jumped over to the left corner andrepeated the same vertical installationprocess I did for the right corner.Although it was much quicker the secondtime around, the LED channel kit camewith corner connectors that allow for aseamless 90° transition. So, I usedthose at both top corners for a cleancontinuous flow of light. I wrappedthings up by installing the final cutchannel on the top side, making sure itjoined perfectly with the existing pieceusing that one's end clip. With thechannels fully mounted, I installed theCOB LED strip that I picked up earlierinside, snapped on the diffusers, andpowered it up using a Ziggb smartcontroller paired with a power adapter.Once everything was connected, I syncedthe lights to my smart home system,giving me full control over brightness,color, and a whole lot more. Next, Iadded a black PS5 controller to thesetup, placing it on a fast wirelesscharge that I picked up from Razer a fewyears ago. I used the pass through gammiI'd installed earlier to route thechargers power cable down to anextension box that I had positionedbehind the couch. I also used the sameextension box to power the other gummypiece on the right wall. To add a bit oftexture to the walls, I decided to pickup something called 3D wall decor panelsoff Etsy. They weren't like anythingthat I'd installed before, but with somehelp from Hannah, we managed to get themall up. Figuring out how to mount themonto the wall and ceiling was definitelythe most timeconuming part of the entireprocess. They didn't come with anyadhesive or mounting hardware, and theinstructions to install them were notclear at all. The seller suggested usingsilicone to hold them in place and ifneeded drive in screws into the sixpre-drilled holes on each base panel.That felt a bit excessive to us, so weended up grabbing some nails from HomeDepot and just used enough to secureeach piece to the wall and the ceiling.Was it the most optimal method? Probablynot, but it did get the job done. Thepanels are designed to form a 3Dhoneycomb pattern. And while they didn'tquite match my expectations perfectlyonce everything was up on the wall, Ihad to admit that it gave the room areally, really unique vibe. It alsohelped the ambient LED lighting standout more rather than just fading intothe plain white walls. We used a mix ofwhite, black, gray, and bronze panels tocreate some contrast and some visualinterest. As for the layouts, we triedour best to create a mirrored lookacross both sides of the room, which tobe frank was not easy at all, but Ithink we pulled it off pretty well. Now,full transparency, the panels weredefinitely pricey for what they are.Each box came in just one color, andsince we wanted four different tones, wehad to buy a few boxes of each color.That racked up the bill pretty quickly.We considered getting more to extend thepattern, but honestly, the cost was asolid hell no for me. At this point, theroom finally had that cozy home theatervibe I was going for, and it was justabout ready for the media setup. Beforethat, there was one last thing that Ihad to take care of, a DIY fix to coverthe ceiling access panel for the showerhead power. It definitely wasn't themost attractive feature in the space.So, I decided to create a cleanersolution. I had an MDF board cut to fitthe space, which I picked up from HomeDepot. Then I wrapped a white striparound all four sides to hide the rawedges and give it a more finished look.Next, I applied small strips of heavyduty double-sided tape around the backof the MDF. Then added weather strippingaround the edge of the ceiling opening.That was mainly to reduce sound and airtransmission through the corners. Asmall detail, but it made sense for amedia room setup. Finally, I pressed theMDF piece into place. The tape held itup nicely for now, but I wouldn't callit a permanent solution at all. It's aquick fix until I figure out a moresolid long-term option. With that out ofthe way, it was finally time to installthe projector. Since saving space was atop priority, I decided to go with aceiling mounted long throw projector.Now, there are a lot of options for thisout there, and I definitely didn't wantto settle for an underwhelming viewingexperience. So, I set a fewnon-negotiable specs the projector hadto meet before I'd even consider it forthe room. After a couple of weeks, Idecided on the Horizon Smax from XJimmy.Big shout out to the brand for sendingover a unit for me to try out. Right outof the box, the projector looked prettypremium and features a built-inadjustable stand with a mounting threadunderneath. There's also a power inputlocated on the base right there. One ofits standout design elements is theautomatic sliding lens cover, whichopens and closes to reveal the lightsource. It's a really neat feature thatadds to its already aesthetic gold misthue. When the cover is in the closedposition, you can see the built-inHarmon Cardan speakers. Although Iwouldn't be needing them for my setup,it's still really nice to have. Also inthe box was a pair of batteries, a poweradapter, and a remote. All having thesame gold mist hue as the projectoritself. It even came with a Google TV 4Kstick, which you get for free with apurchase of the projector. XJimmy alsosent out a couple of accessories uh forthe projector, including the ceilingmount and a floor stand. These do notcome standard with the projector, butare available as optional add-ons. Theceiling mount also has the protector'sgold mist aesthetic and comes in threepieces. It has a special compartmentthat houses the protector's power blockinside of it, keeping things reallyclean. The floor stand, on the otherhand, came in two easy to assemblepieces and the same gold mist aesthetic,though I do not plan on using it in thiscase. We moved on to installing theceiling mount next. The process waspretty straightforward and all I had todo was secure the power adapter insideits dedicated compartment, then securethe mounts to the ceiling using screwson all sides. I initially tried routingmy HDMI cable through the mount as well,but it made the cover not fit properly.So, I left that hanging out the back asit seems the mount cable management wasonly designed for the projector's powercable. The last step in the process wasattaching the mount's final piece to theprojector and then locking it into placeon the ceiling. It held up really welland from there, all that was left wasplugging in the power and the HDMIcable. The central control unit foreverything going into the projector isthe Pioneer VSSX 935 AVR, which I pickedup specifically for this setup. AVRshave been around for as long as I canremember, and honestly, they're stillone of the best solutions for unifiedhome the media control. That said,they're usually pretty bulky, so therewas no way I was going to have onesitting inside the actual movie room.Instead, I talked it neatly into mymedia rack right where it belongs. TheHDMI cable I connected to the projectorfeeds into one of the two HDMI outputports on the AVR, which is then linkedto all eight surround sound speakers inthe room, delivering a full highqualityaudio experience. On the input side, theAVR gives you eight HDMI input ports,which means I can connect everythingfrom gaming consoles to streamingdevices with ease. For streaming, Ipicked up an Apple TD4K with an Ethernetport and hooked it directly into boththe AVR and my network switch to ensurethe best possible connection. Trust me,there's going to be no buffer in here. Ialso brought in my first gen PS5, placedit on the media rack, and connected itto both the AVR and the Switch as well.With everything routed through the AVR,I've got centralized control,highfidelity audio, and ultra cleancable management, all without taking upspace in the actual viewing area. It'sphenomenal. I know. At this point, theroom already had that cozy home theatervibe I was aiming for. But the nextpiece we brought in took things to awhole new level. We decided to go withsomething called a cloud couch for theseating in the area. mainly because ofhow unbelievably comfy they usually are.The comfort level of a cloud couch isoften compared to what it would feellike to sleep on a real cloud, whichobviously explains the name. I've neverowned one myself before, but I've alwayswanted to, so I figured this was theperfect excuse to finally splurge. Andyeah, it was definitely a splurge. Thiscouch was not cheap by any meanswhatsoever, but I wanted to make sureevery second that was spent in this roomwas as comfortable as possible. Cloudcouches are fully customizable, kind oflike Maja sofas you see everywhere. Now,taking a room's layout and spaceconstraints into account, we went withtwo corner pieces, one centerpiece, andtwo ottomans. It also came with a bunchof soft oversized pillows, but we alsodecided to add a few accent ones for asubtle pop of color.I originally considered getting twosubwoofers for this space, buteventually realized that woulddefinitely be a bit overkill for such asmall space. One was more than enough toget the impact I was after. To keepthings consistent with the rest of theaudio setup, I went with a Pulk audiosub. It came in black, which didn'tmatch the white speakers, but honestly,it's subtle enough that it doesn't standout in a distracting way. Next up on theagenda was setting up the projector andall the media devices I had hooked up toit. As soon as the projector powered on,the first thing I did was pair it withthe remote and then went on to connectto Wi-Fi before jumping into the initialsetup process. The projector is equippedwith autofocus, which automaticallysharpens the image projected withoutneeding to do anything manually. There'salso a manual focus option if you wantto fine-tune it, but honestly, theautofocus worked perfectly right out ofthe box. Next was auto keystonecorrection, another time-saving featurethat adjusts the screen alignment inreal time. That alone made positioningway easier. Once that was set, I gotinto the manual alignment tools to tweakthe image just a bit further. It didn'ttake very long, just a few minorcorrections, and then I moved on to oneof the most interesting parts of thesetup. The projector gave me the optionto choose between the new dual light 2.0light source mode or the moretraditional laser mode. Dual light 2.0on the Horizon S Max offers higherbrightness up to 3100 lumens, a widercolor gamut, better contrast, andoverall more accurate color reproductionand also a more comfortable viewingexperience. Of course, I decided to gowith this new mode to see how it works.Another standout feature is the ultrawidec screen mode. Definitely a firstfor me on a projector. It's a very cooloption to have, especially if I decideto bring a gaming PC into the mix lateron. The Horizon S Max also comes withsomething called wall color adaptation,which helps calibrate the projector'scolors based on the surface it'sprojecting onto. I'm currently using thestandard white painted wall as myscreen. And even then, this featurehelped refine the color accuracy andimprove the overall image quality. Aftergetting through the initial setup, Imade a few physical adjustments to theprojector's angle, then went back intothe settings for another round of autokeystone correction along with somelight manual tweaking. You'll find allthe image correction tools likeautofocus, screen shift, image zoom, andmore right in the settings menu of theprojector. But honestly, there's notmuch that needs to be done manually.Most of it just works straight out ofthe box. Next, I switched theprojector's input source to the HDMIports connected to my AVR in the otherroom. A few seconds later, my Apple TVpopped up on the screen. No extra setupneeded since I'd already configured itbeforehand. The projector automaticallyenabled IMAX enhanced mode, which was anice touch. First thing I did was testout how it handled video playback frommy Plex server and other platforms. Now,while the video was playing, I realizedI hadn't turned on Dolby Vision on theApple TV. something the projector isfully capable of handling. So, I jumpedinto the settings menu and made theswitch immediately. I went ahead andtweaked a few more settings to match mypreferences, then continued the clip,this time with Dolby Vision fullyenabled. The result, phenomenal. Idecided to test out the PS5 digitalnext. I had that hooked up to thededicated HDMI 2.1 game port on the AVR.As expected, since it was connected to anew display, it walked me through theusual screen alignment and HDRcalibration process. After updating thesystem firmware, I jumped straight intoa session of God of War to see how wellthe projector handled realtime gaming.And honestly, it did not disappoint. TheHorizon Sax also has game optimizingfeatures, uh, like low latency and awhole lot more, which can be accessedthrough the settings menu as well. MyXbox Series X hadn't been getting muchuse in its previous location. So, Iadded it to the media rack to sitalongside the PS5 as well. Just like Idid with the PS5, I hooked it up with ahardwired internet connection for themost reliable performance and thenplaced an Xbox controller on anotherwireless charger stored neatly on thesame wall shelf. Once powered on, Ioptimized the Series X for the Horizon SMax and loaded up Assassin's CreedOdyssey for a quick gaming session.What's a home theater without snacks andbeverages? Just outside of the roomwithin my studio space, I've got a wetbar setup complete with storage drawersand a mini fridge stocked for movienights, gaming sessions, and everythingin between. At the end of it all, theroom turned out even better than I'dimagined, and it fully delivered on thepurpose that I had in mind for it. Thankyou guys for sticking with me throughoutthis one. I really appreciate it. Let meknow down in the comment section whatpart of the room you like the most. Andif you're curious about any of theproducts I used uh throughout thisvideo, including the powerful HorizonSmax, be sure to check out thedescription box below for all the links.Thanks again for watching, and I hope tocatch you in my next video. It's Tommy,and I'm out, y'all.[Music]","You're such an inspiration and I love your calm energy. Even though I'm 31, I still aspire to be like you and your stability.
I'm currently living in a shelter with my beautiful family living from paycheck to paycheck in LA. Hopefully, I can reach your stability someday.
Bro your setups are always INSANE! The details, your ability to build anything, and those 3D wall panels!
Yessir, the perfect kick back and relax video after a long day of work
Awesome setup. If you're going to get a screen raise the centre channel so it's in line with your left and right and get an acoustic transparent screen.
You should definitely consider adding a screen to your projector setup — it would elevate the overall aesthetic of the room and prevent the space from feeling incomplete when the projector is off. Additionally, the Apple TV isn’t configured correctly for Dolby Vision HDR. You’ll want to leave Dolby Vision disabled under Format settings, and instead enable Match Dynamic Range and Match Frame Rate in the Match Content settings. Excellent video — keep up the great work.
you won't believe how long i have waited for this episode following the previous ones
This video has definitely inspired me to step my game up
Bruh those polygon panels is dope AF! Awesome room!
You're an impressive dude. Great inspiration for old and young alike
It’s grommet (grom-met) not (grom-may). Nicely done, I’m so jealous of your setups , bro! Lol.
The fact that you’re Nigerian and achieving all of this really inspiring can’t lie 
I’m really motivated mennn
Nice setup, if you get/got an acoustically transparent screen you could put your LCR all in line at the same level right behind the screen that would them match the voices to the dialogue coming from the screen rather than from the floor. A huge difference in the sound performance of your system. I'm sure your past that point so maybe an upgrade in the future, but a dedicated space in and of itself is amazing.
Theaters are painted black not white. To minimize light bouncing off the ceiling and walls
Great setup, really nice. Congrats. I would consider raising your center channel to ear level, go with a darker color for your walls, and lastly, install acoustic panels to kill sound reflections from the speakers and it will improve your listening experience.
it looks really good! the contrast of colors is super clean!
Get a screen first of all, and you need to make your room darker, preferably with black velvet materials for better contrast.
This was a great watch. super chill diy, great job.
Picking up on just little bit of that island accent. Not enough there to tell where from, but it's there, my man! Love your content, bredda
Nize setup i have a white wall too for home cinema but i prefere dark walls more, so that bright scenes doesnt bounce off all over the place but it may be personal preference
FYI, you should change your Apple TV setting to 4k SDR 60hz. And then set “match for content”. Otherwise everything will be displayed in HDR (up converted).
New to the channel. Love the full walkthrough build of your home theater
felicidades, ese cuarto es increiblemente estupendo, buen sonido, bonita imagen, comodo y completamente apartado de los ruidos exteriores, increiblemente bello.
bros living in paradise
Absolutely love the setup, awesome work !
The only thing I would add would be another shelf behind the back of the couch so who ever is in the middle will also have somewhere to put things or u can use it just for a little extra storage space. This is something I even want to do for my own living room couch, just an idea. But I love the whole set up!!
All i can see is a fire keep it up bro
The style and everything is amazing. I think my IRIS Device agrees bc the “take a break” notification popped up w/o muting or even pausing your video. Subscribed!
The issue with using AVR’s for hdmi is the older ones are usually not hdmi 2.1 passthrough. People should check that because you can lose quality when running next gen consoles like PS5. The pioneer vsx935 in this video from 2021 does have 2.1 though. Just something for the viewers to check. If you’re running an older AVR for sound then you should run the 2.1 device straight to the tv/projector, then run a digital optical cable straight back to the AVR. Or if you have a tv with a HDMI ARC/eARC you can use that HDMI input as your hdmi input from the AVR to the tv ARC means Audio Return Channel so it has 2 purposes- Sending video to the tv from the AVR and also audio from the tv back to the AVR
Looks great man. Also worth mentioning, that Halo 20th Anniversary edition Series X is fiiiireeee. Damn it's awesome.
Gj mate ! Room looks amazing .
Super cool and creative hopefully you get good use of the room
DopeNess As Always Brother!!! When you guys were installing the honeycomb decor… 13:19 I was like da hell going on here Yall Got it Looking Good!! Take Care Brother!!
You already know it's gon be a banger
Nice! I think i saw another video of yours that was just a soundbar. AVR with surround sound is the way to go! Very nice. I would have elevated the center with a screen that allows audio passthrough, had 4 heights and had external amps, but im sure you did your research and got exactly what you wanted. The server rack always keeps things organized! Very nice! Next upgrade, think about bass shakers. Nice wetbar
Amazing set up. Would highly recommend using a screen. Even the best newest sheet rock will dull your picture. Sheetrock is not designed to display a projector, obviously u can do it. It’s like shinning an extremely bright light on your wall. Even the cheapest of screens will offer a better viewing experience. Don’t take my word for it, do your own reasearch and you can always try a screen and see how it goes and return it if it’s not helping. the one upside to not having a scree with your projector is you can switch very easily from 16:9 to wide screen. And most movies are in widescreen, but not all. Not having a screen would allow you to switch back and forth easily. They make screens like that, but they are highly expensive. Good luck. Love that couch
I didnt know avr was a thing till now , Great video and very informative
Wow, Great set up. Love what you have done to the place. When can I move in?
It's beautiful, and makes me reluctant to nitpick -- but as an HT designer fora long time, I would have said to go AT to prevent those LR speakers from being jammed in the corners, and the center being so low. That said, the space is very inviting.
i was so exited to see what do you mean for a home theater 
and here it is the video
let see what you cooked for us
good luck bro
much love to you from Iran
Good video bro and nice man cave
Same as acoustic panels, there are diffusion panels for video projectors, you have pollution from the ceiling as you can see
You did a great job on room
Always well paced and informed videos, that explain and show what needs to be. Great room again
Ive been waiting to watch this, i had it saved on watch later and i wish i had seen it sooner, AC odyssey was quite a platinum along with god of war Ragnarok
You guys are bosses fantastic job
I have been waiting for this one!
Good vid man ... Gave me some ideas for my own set up
Gangsta man cave my bro
would have used a magnetic latch and use some hinges on that access panel since it likely will be opened again.
My fav part was the bathroom
Giving some ideas bro! Great content
Nice video dude, as always.
We need a full blown 2 hr tutorial of how that server rack and all the components interconnect into one another I wanna do that my self
Looks good
I was literally just watching an old video of yours bro
Good Job
You'll likely be getting a huge amount of audio reflections off the front left and right side walls right up to the speakers, because they are against the side wall. You need accoustic panels there. Ideally they should have been closer in off the walls, but too late now. Such an enclosed small refective space for audio isn't going to be great anyway, but the furniture would help a lot. Still, you really need something to fix those front speakers.
Also, how do you breath in there? I'd be worried about poor ventilation in such a sealed space. How does the air coming in even get out?
Man can u tell me what is your work? Damn it was so crazy to watch your videos
the best gaming setup
The best way to do an installation at home and be able to solve any future problems is to do it yourself, since this way you do not depend on anyone to solve your problems... Yes, I know that not everyone can, either because of knowledge or possibility, but that is the reality.
For the ceiling cover I would use magnets
Why you didnt use a panel and used the all wall? And how you control the devices that are on the other room? Thanks for the videos. Fantastic
Personally the wall panels were a lot! I would've used them on the back wall only
Where did you get the cloud couch from, it is fire
Nice set up. Do you have a link to that carpet? Thanks!
link to couch?
damnnnnnnnnnn, am jaw opened, i always tell people of your setups, TOP NOTCHH
Just FYI, grommets are prounounced ""Grom-mets""...not ""Grom-Mays"".
Love your vids. FYI, grommet is pronounced ""graa·muht"".
Fantastic work. How big is your room in dimensions?
love it! One thing though, it's pronounced ""grahm-ette"" not ""grahm-ay"" lol had me chucklin a lil bit. Seriously though you did a fantastic job!!!
Nice
Great Video. I always wait for new videos. By the way, how you can control your Pioneer AVR from your tv room and choose which HDMI output for example?
You should have went with a laser TV projector with an ALR screen.
7.1.4 is ideal
Bro, this is a fantastic space, that honeycomb is just But I am curious, after my own experience with an ultra short throw projector, why didn't you consider that? Something like the Hisense PX3 that I reviewed recently would be incredible. Love the work here dawg and I can't wait to see more of the house.
Awsome
Bro works out his biceps with cement trucks
Bro, how are you Upgraded? . Great video
you have a great set up but your are not getting full advantage from the projector using a wall , get a nice white screen with 1.1 gain and thank me later and if you want deeper black and color an ALR screen material will suit you very well

On the Xbox Series S, itheld a steady 120 fps in Creative, butit is pretty upscaled. When I switchedto 60 FPS, you can see the graphicsactually look like a true high ultrasettings. And then switching back to120, you can see that it doesn't lookbad, but it's just truly not a true highsettings. On the $350 gaming PC, it hitaround 240 FPS in creative and hoveredbetween 100 to 150 FPS in game. It didstutter a bit though, so I had to dropit down to 720p just to make the gameplay so much smoother. If you play onkeyboard and mouse, the PC definitelyfeels better, even if it has a fewstutters. But let me know down in thecomments which one you guys wouldactually","Bros is biased towards pc
You'd get more price to performance if you didn't get the ""White components"" tax

White PC parts are on average 5-10% more expensive
720p lol dang
keep in mind boys that pc is playing fortnite on way lower settings with performance mode on, so the pc got a pretty unfair advantage against the console
Well, it doesn't use upscaling on 1080p 120fps. And neither on 1440p 60fps since upscaling is not available in every game and is not needed. In some games like Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, it does use upscaling from 1080p 60fps with custom ray tracing.
The pc Will perform better if it was all black build
So, here’s the thing, I got my Xbox used with two controllers for 185, so in THAT price range Xbox is better, but $350, build a pc
Personally I think that Xbox is better as in reality it is selling better components for a very much better value per pound
Honestly, you should try getting a higher price range for a custom pc. Some oc brands have a high or overpriced pc for bad preformance but you can just ask somebody for help on good specs for a custom pc. In the end, the xbox is better.
Bro why did you buy a prebuilt if it’s 350 bucks you NEED to build custom and never go white unless you got like 750$ + not worth horrible outcome because of YOU!
I got a series s for 190 so it’s better than a budget pc and I just got it until I’m able to save for a pc
Dude this is @Vermax video
Do you know why it is stuttering? VRAM, yes— that’s right. With such a budget graphics card you’re not getting a lot of VRAM and therefore it can really take some hits in FPS’ like Fortnite. In this scenario where you don’t have a lot of money to spend, you should always go for the console, but if you really want a PC. I’d say spend a minimum of 500$ and if that’s not good enough do 1000$ and if that’s not good enough again and you want something high-tier, do 1500$ MAX.
Xbox imo is more versatile and just has a wider variety of options and overall preferences.
Xbox is meant to be more affordable, and games that you can play on Xbox are tested to see if the Xbox can even handle it. Getting a $350 PC is a waste of money. If you spend $1000 on PC you can play almost every game that has ever come out (ever) at 60+ fps. PC is also upgradable and way more compatible with games and controllers. Not to mention over clocking and other optimization techniques. Also PCs generally have more storage.

Bottom line: if u just want to game on a few specific games, and you don't want to bust the bank, go with Xbox.

If you want a more powerful and overall compatibility with any game you could ever want, go with PC.
Can someone help my game wall breaks when i enable lumen , i use rx6600xt i really wnt to play on high graphics, i dont care for fps
No comments let. Me fix that
Can that thang play dayz ? The pc not the Xbox .. I like that price point
What pc is it?
Bro 720p im not in 2010
Xbox because cheaper better fps
Xbox.The delay for kbm isnt that bad.And i want stable framerate .120 fps is kore than enough for me since i used to play fn on 25 fps on 800x600
Yeah , build if yourself, use used parts, dont use white parts, and you can prob get a high performance pc
Lemme share you a 450 dollar pc build for 1080p
Ryzen 5 3600 from aliexpress 65$
Thermalright assasin x se 17$
Asrock b450m-hdv 70$
Silicon power 16gb -25$
Crucial p3 plus 500gb for 40$
Used rx 6600 from ebay (look for one thsts 140-170$)
Montech air 903 base - 65$
Msi 650bn ps- 50$
Total: 470-500
I mean, if uve already decided that u want a gaming pc, y spend so less, just save up some money. Or else, get a console
W VIDEOO
Console for now pc become awesome over 700$
What’s the PC name?
i would pick the pc bc on xbox you cant stream that good and stuff and im trying to get a big streamer and you can play other things on the pc
Pc 100%
Xbox not much competition
Console used to be better for performance but those days are long gone. Just compare the GPU size to the console. Better off comparing a laptop to the console now
Yo wsg
Fluxhphy Give me one of ur pc's (atcually tho) my ps4 doesn't cut it

So,that's sort of what I'm doing today. I'malso going to be, you know, updating andupgrading this desk setup here. Um, notthe biggest thing ever, but I'm going todive into that. U, but fun fact, KTCsent me this monitor like 6 months ago,and I forgot to make a video about it.And I think today's um a better day thanany to sort of dive in mainly becauseI'm uh updating this desk setup here uphere in my bedroom. Now, this setupparticularly is a little bit different.Um I guess you could say it's a bit morespecial. Mainly because um compared to,you know, my basement setup that I spenda lot of time at, this place up here inmy bedroom is only meant for rest andrelaxation. Whereas in my basement, Ispend myself spending a lot of timethere. Yes, I do, you know, have thechance to game and relax and watch showsand all that. Um, but I find myselfworking a whole ton down there. Andsometimes I feel like I'm sort ofrotting or I'm getting stale. And uh,plus it's nice to get some naturalsunlight, which I do get up here in mybedroom. So, yeah, despite having, youknow, my dream setup down in thebasement, um, I feel a lot of pressureoften to work down there cuz that's theplace where I do my day job as anaccountant as well as all my YouTube,which, you know, it's more so a hobby,but sometimes I feel pressure to makevideos. So, up here, at least, this iswhere I'm going to get my full rest andrelaxation. Now, in this scenario, thismonitor at least is the KTC G27 P6S, Ithink it's called. I'm going to leave alittle note here if that's right orwrong, but um that's the model number.And pretty much this is a 1440p OLEDmonitor, um which is actually theupgraded version of what could be myfavorite 1440p monitor of all time. Ithink I used the previous model of thisspecific monitor um the most out of anymonitor I've ever reviewed or bought oranything. So, I'm pretty pumped to havethe upgraded version of it and I'll sortof talk about a bit of the differencesum with this one. But sadly, I don'thave the previous model because it didget water damaged. Um but that's why I'mpretty stoked to have the newer versionof it. Now, as for why this particularmonitor is um a little bit more specialat least is because it's just soincredibly versatile and I find itprobably one of the best options interms of affordability and the featureset you're actually getting. For me atleast, that's going to be things like,you know, watching shows, movies, mediain general. Um, as well as, of course,myself as a gamer, I'm going to betalking heavily about, you know, consolegaming. And recently, I got back into myPC gaming, which is a huge bonus forthis. And definitely while this setup isprimarily sort of my oasis away fromwhere I typically get all my accountingwork done, um I do actually love to workon YouTube. So there is a productivityaspect to this display, um especiallyediting, which I'll talk about. Andagain, while I'm a bit of a wannabeminimalist, um I say wannabe because I Iown way too much stuff, especially as atech channel, it's hard not to. But as awannabe minimalist, I really umappreciate minimal setups. And with thisdisplay, at least with the KVM andstuff, it does sort of allow me to havea more minimal setup without reallysacrificing all too much, which I'lltalk about. Now, for this display atleast, it is a 27inch size, which stillsort of remains my favorite display sizedue to, you know, the balance betweenresolution, um, clarity, as well as theactual footprint and size of the displayitself. Um, not only that, it's justhardware- wise, it's a lot easier to run1440p at 240 Hz. Now, in terms of all,you know, the ports and connectivity,like I mentioned, this is a veryversatile monitor, particularly in thissetup because, um, it has two HDMI 2.0ports. I'm only using one of them for myPlayStation 5. Um, it has a displayport, which goes to my PC, um, for my PCgaming. And then it does have a type-Cport, which is probably my favoritething about this monitor. I I'll sayit's probably tied for my favoritething. And that has 65 watt powerdelivery, which is awesome. Now, whatsort of ties my PC and whatever I haveplugged into that type-C together is thebuilt-in KVM, which pretty much allowsme to to um connect all my peripheralsor whatever else between those twodevices, and it just swaps between them,which is awesome. So, if you have, youknow, wireless dongles or whatever, uhyou can just connect that to the KVM andit goes between both the machines. Thereis also an audio jack here if you dowant to plug in, you know, like aheadset or a set of speakers orsomething. Um, definitely good to have.Particularly, I will say the built-inspeakers here are uh excellent. likemore than excellent and I'll talk aboutthat as well. Um, so I don'tparticularly have it. Again, I want tokeep my setup minimal, but the autojackis there if you need it. And fun factabout this monitor is that the panelitself is from LG, which is prettybadass. Um, this is the newer genversion of this of the panel. Again, Iwas talking about the previous versionof this model. The difference is thatthe newer one has MLA plus, which uhpretty much makes it get a lot brighter,which is awesome. I wasn't expectingthat. So, kudos KTC. Um definitely ahuge plus having a brighter display. Nowin terms of you know this setup as awhole and this monitor specifically is Ipretty much have everything I need inthis setup as you know minimal as it canbe. Um I recently got back into PCgaming like I mentioned and this thisthing over here is through the displayport of course and this is probably thesmallest um RTX 4070 PC I've ever found.Um that's an ASUS ROG Knuck which isflipping awesome. Pairs well at 1440pgaming. And of course I do have my goodold faithful PlayStation 5. Uh, I lovemy PS5. I love my console gaming. I'mone of those guys that loves both. So,um, that makes it into the setup. Ofcourse, for me at least, again, after along day, my favorite thing to do isgaming. It's always gaming. I do love towatch my shows and movies and all that,but gaming is usually my go-to if I havethe option to do it. It really is justone of those things that actually letsme slow down and relax. And of course,I'll talk more about gaming uh in amoment. Now, in terms of the type-Cport, I'm primarily going to be justusing this for my M4 MacBook Air, maybemy M4 iPad Pro. Um, not my work laptopwhatsoever. This this place is my nowork zone, which is awesome. Um, I don'tcount YouTube particularly as work. Um,despite the time that goes into videosand stuff, that's just one of my funhobbies that I love and I love creationwork. I love editing. I love makingvideos. So, my M4 MacBook Air will gothrough that type-C board. Um, likewise,again, that has connectivity to um theKVM switch, which right now I actuallyam powering this light bar on my monitorthat's going through the KVM port umjust because it draws power anyways. So,um, that works perfect as well as mygaming mouse. So, my gaming mouse goesthrough there. My keyboard specificallyis Bluetooth. I'm okay with that. Again,I'm not much, um, as a tryhard as Ipreviously was for, you know, usingdirect plugged or dongles and stuff forthe 2.4. I'm just going Bluetooth on mykeyboard and it works perfectly fine.Beyond that, during the night time, thisthis room gets insanely dark and thissetup is really dark. Um, apart fromthis light bar on top, I never use thebig light anywhere. Any any of theceiling lights I never use. Um, I preferto have a more relaxed sort of cozysetting, but this is still super dark. Ihave my portable lamps. You guys haveseen in a thousand videos. I love theseflipping lamps. I bring them with mealmost everywhere I'm reading or workingor whatever it is. Um, but I'm actuallygoing to get it. I got this new littlething. I got I got this light for like15 bucks. It's a GOI light. Um, it's thesame light strip that I use on mybasement desk setup, and it's actually aTV backlight, but it was like 12 or 15bucks or something. So, um, I like toput these around the edge of my desksbecause it helps illuminate against thewall and brings some light into thespace. And I can set it to whatevercolor I want, which is awesome. So,yeah, I'm going to go ahead and set thisup today. Um, as well as some[Music]gaming. But yeah, that's the setup. It'spretty basic. Um, somewhat minimalisticand I really dig it, especiallyeverything plugged into the monitoritself. Uh, honestly, it's just an easyway to have a nice dope lookingaesthetic setup. Plus, the Groveade deskshelf and the Wool Pad um do make a hugeaccent to this whole thing. So, Ireally, really dig it. Now, to actuallytalk a bit about um gaming. What thismonitor really particularly excels at, Ican say, is PC gaming. I actually tookum a pretty hefty break from PC gamingover the last, you know, three and ahalf, maybe four months after goingsuper hard into competitive Overwatch. Ihit the rank I wanted to hit and then Isort of burnt out and uh took a bit of abreak. I have been console gaming umparticularly during that time period. Umso it is most definitely refreshingcoming back to PC gaming. A because I'mgetting back into competitive games. I'mnot trying as hard as I was previously,but it is again nice to hop back intothose hero shooters I love. And b 240hertz. I've been uh playing at 120 Hzfor quite some time over the last bit.So it's a good bump in refresh ratewhich I really do appreciate. thatparticularly is going to be awesome whenit comes down to those hero shooters Imentioned. For me at least, I've alwayssort of just been drawn to uh heroshooters. I've been playing Overwatchsince its beta. And more recently, I'vegotten into uh you know, Marvel Rivalscuz that game is flipping awesome.Definitely a fun time. It's similar butdifferent enough that I'm still having agreat time with it. And uh it's a goodtime to play on PC. For me at least, I'mnot, you know, I don't expect myself tobe the top 500 player I once was or evengrand masters and stuff, but it is niceto hop back into PC gaming. For me atleast particularly, it's going to be,you know, the 0.03 millisecond responsetime on here that does make thecompetitive difference. Always somethingI appreciate when it comes to OLEDpanels. And they just look really good.In terms of the actual resolution, thisis 1440p like I mentioned before. Andhonestly, I find this to be the absoluteperfect balance um in terms ofmodern-day gaming. Not only does 1440pstill look incredible in terms of, youknow, fidelity, details, graphics, evenoutside of gaming, it's going to lookreally good, but it's also a lot easierto run on modern hardware, even olderhardware. You can get 1440p at 60 Hz,you can get 1440p at 120 Hz. Um, for me,again, my PC bounces anywhere between120 Hz to 240 Hz depending on the gameI'm playing. And 1440p sort of gives methat option depending on what I want tochoose. Now, since this is an OLED panelas well, and this sort of goes in handwith media as well, not just gaming, isthat OLED panels really do lookincredible. And honestly, it's reallyhard to match up to them. I've revieweda ton of different panel types from, youknow, fast IPS to VA to TN, all thesedifferent displays. They look good.They're not bad by any means, but whenyou compare that to, you know, the inkyblacks of OLED and the rich colors andthe infinite contrast ratios, it's hardnot to, you know, see the benefits of anOLED panel. Now, if you haven't heard ofan OLED panel, compared to somethinglike LCD, um LCDs, they will havedimming zones where those zones, if theywant to reach closer to black, they'lljust dim down, right? That's whatthey're called, dimming zones. Theproblem is th those zones are, you know,little blocks on the panel. Um they canonly go so dim. So, the blacks somewhatlook like dark grays. Um now, with OLEDpanels, uh the pixels individually turnon and off. So, when the pixel is off togive you black, it literally is black.Um, so that's why OLED panels look asincredible as they do. And not thatit's, you know, a huge comparison. I'lljust have a quick um photo or clip hereshowing my iPad. I guess I'll use myiPad, which is I think an LCD, whatever.Again, that isn't to say LCD is bad, butmy absolute preference comes down toOLED. Again, hopping from uh myPlayStation or my Xbox Series X back toPC for Marvel Rivals. A, I'm gettingabsolutely stomped on because I'm rustyas heck on PC. Uh, but man does it lookgood, especially at that 240 Hz. I loveRivals. It's an awesome game. So, if youhaven't tried it yet, definitely give ita try. But yeah, if I do want to slow itdown a bit, I recently did get back intoWorld of Warcraft for the first time inlike 5 or 6 years, and people warned menot to get back into it. Um, it's a fungame, but honestly, right now, as atired ass dad, I don't have a lot oftime in the first place, so I trulycan't commit to it like I once did aslike a top 100 North America raider andall that. I don't have time for that.Right now, I'm playing casually for thefirst time in my life. and it's a goodtime. So, if you want to try World ofWarcraft, give it a go or don't. It canbe addicting depending on who you are.Um, but yeah, for me right now, it'snice to play casually. But yeah, apartfrom World of Warcraft, I do love myDiablo I is always a good time. Um, aswell as games like Red Dead Redemption2. Absolutely incredible game. I love toplay those um to test out any monitorsI'm on, and that's always a good timefor those games. Now, of course, Iabsolutely love my PC gaming. And Idon't get it, but people seem to thinkI'm crazy that I love console gaming aswell as PC gaming. It's like it's acrime to love both for some magicreason. But again, I love my PlayStation5. Um, particularly I will say for somereason, I don't know what it is, but theHDR experience on console um alwayssweeps the floor with my PCs regardlessof what the spec on my PC is. Um, I'mnot sure if that's a Windows thing, um,a PC thing. Either way, I love the HDRperformance on here. Now, I'm not one toever particularly test my monitors. Idon't calibrate them. I don't measuretheir peak brightnesses and stuff. So,I'll leave a link in the description ifyou do want to check out somebody elsewho's smarter than I am and tested allthis stuff. Um, Display Ninja, I thinkit is. Um, they they check out all thepeak brightnesses of HDR and stuff, butif I'm not mistaken, the SDR brightnessuh is brighter on this one. Again, it'sabout 275 nits for SDR content. Butagain, where it shines for meparticularly, it's going to be the HDRgaming on console. I love it. Um, if I'mnot mistaken, the you know, 1% peakbrightness is 1300 nits, which isactually pretty flipping awesome. Andagain, that goes in hand with my umediting that I've had a chance to do onthis monitor. This entire video thatyou're watching right now was edited onthis monitor. Um and I absolutely loveit for that. Again, on my PlayStation 5at least, I love to play games like umCyberpunk to really flex the HDRcapacity on uh these systems as well asthe display. And it does look absolutelyflipping awesome. And for the most partright now, um I'm still gettingabsolutely dunked on in Elden Ring. Umbut it is a good time. Elden Ring iskept at 60 Hz. Um, and depending on thegame you are playing, it might be 60 Hzor 120 Hz. Okay, so I'm actually editingthis video right now and um, I'm notsure if the spec sheet online isincorrect, but it says HDMI 2.0, but Iwas playing my PS5 last night and bothVRR and ALM worked on my PS5, which istypically only available on HDMI 2.1.Um, so yeah, I think this has HDMI 2.1,um, which is definitely a welcomeupgrade over the last iteration of thismonitor. Still, I do find the consoleexperience awesome. And this is wherethe majority of my slower games arewhere I can sort of relax a little bitmore um if I don't feel like playing anysort of hero shooters or anything. Andagain, the speakers on this display areawesome, which are great for any sort ofconsole players. You just plug it in andaway you go. Now, to lean back into theimage aspect of this display again, umI've been spending a healthy amount oftime actually watching shows for oncethis year. Um again, finding a betterbalance between work and media andrelaxing and whatever the heck it is.Um, I've been watching shows on hereright now. My go-to is Invincible. I'mfinishing that up. Incredible show, bythe way. Thank you guys for thesuggestions on that. Um, I mentionedthat in my last video, and boy is thatshow wild. But yeah, it's not justanimated content. I find anime looksbest on OLEDs and stuff, but pretty muchanything I've thrown on here, um, looksgood. And I've been spending a goodamount of time watching shows instead ofjust working myself into oblivion. Butthe comment section has been popping offwith, uh, suggestions for media andgames and shows and books. Um, so, thankyou guys. I think the next thing I'mgoing to watch is either Arcane or SoloLeveling, one of those two. Um because Ijust discovered anime for the first timein like the last year, year and a halfor something like that. But beyond that,the speakers I mentioned, um it's a dual5 watt setup. I don't know if the specsheet's lying u because they soundbetter than dual 5 watt and I've hadlots of dual 5 watt speakers in monitorsbefore that sound awful. So, I don'tknow if it's because, you know, this hasa bit of a bulbous uh back end. I'm notsure if acoustically the speakers can dobetter. They don't sound like 5 watts. Idig them. They sound great. Um, again,it sort of allows me to have a moreminimal setup and not have externalspeakers. For me, they're excellent. Butif you want something more than that, ofcourse, you do always have the audiojack.[Music]But yeah, obviously these speakersaren't going to beat an external set ofuh speakers, but they do sound good. Um,if good is the middle point for audioquality, these are uh a good chunk pastthat. But yeah, beyond gaming and mediaand stuff, for the times that I do, youknow, want to do some productive work,particularly YouTube. Again, I don'tparticularly classify it as work, Ireally do enjoy it as one of my hobbies.Um, so the type-C port is definitelymeant for my MacBook Air. Um, and thisentire video was actually edited on thisdisplay uh through the type-C port. Ican definitely say during, you know, theediting phase, color grading and stufflooks awesome on an OLED panel. Andperformance overall is excellent. So, nocomplaints. I will say too, um, with thenewer LG panel, again, like I mentioned,this is a newer generation of the panel.So, a lot of people had complaints aboutthe first generation or whatevergeneration, the previous one, people hadcomplaints about text um with colorfringing. Uh, and I can say that'smostly just gone. I've never personallybeen sensitive to um fringing on text,but it is mostly gone here if that'ssomething that you're worried about. Butyeah, working on any sort of YouTuberstuff won't, you know, encroach into myrelaxing zone because that is relaxingfor me. I really do dig making YouTubevideos. Um, that's why I mentioned thatas a part of this setup. Now, I sort ofmentioned it before. As much as I lovemy basement setup, um I spend a lot oftime down in my basement. It's dark,there's no natural light, and um it'sagain it is my dream setup, uh butsometimes I feel pressured to work downthere. Uh which is why I have this sortof setup up here in my bedroom where Ican a get natural light and b sort ofescape from just being in the same placeall the time for myself at least. Justtrying to find a bit of a better worklife balance. Um when I sit herespecifically and again I'm very verygrateful to have a secondary spot tosort of sit at. In this spot, I can givemyself permission to actually be adegenerate and just watch more than just20 minutes of a show after the kids goto bed or actually just play World ofWarcraft for a couple hours, which is aa bit of a new thing for me to playgames more than 30 minutes or so. Butyeah, some of the things for a desksetup for me at least that are importantis the setup's got to look good. It'sgot to be functional and whatever I'mdoing's got to look damn good. Um, whichis in part by this monitor when it comesdown to media, gaming, or whatever else.Honestly, prior to 2025 at least, Ialways found myself just rushing to thenext thing, whether that's mydestination, finishing a task orproject, a YouTube video. I wouldsometimes rush those. I would only playhero shooters for the quick matches andstuff. So, finally actually allowingmyself to sort of do nothing has beenthe best absolute thing for myself thisyear. Um, if you haven't done nothing ina while, give it a try. But yeah, if youfind yourself similar to me in thatsituation where you're rushing to thenext everything, you're going to beokay, dude. just slow down and enjoyyourself as corny as that is. But yeah,but obviously you don't have to listento some random dude on the internet talkabout a gaming monitor and his desksetup. Uh but if you feel like you needto slow down, just slow down. You'll begood. Anyways, for me at least, thiswhole desk setup will be my designatedunproductive zone and I'm okay withthat. Plus, it looks awesome. And I willhave everything linked down below if youdo want to check out anything in mysetup. Um, of course, the monitor aswell. KTC, thank you for sending this tome 6 months ago. Sorry it took me thislong to make a video. Either way, I amgoing to enjoy this dopeass monitor.Play some more World of Warcraft. And ifany of you guys are WoW nerds, add meup. I'll have my battle tag in thecomment section. We can run somedungeons casually, of course. If any ofyou anime nerds out there have anysuggestions, leave them down below aswell. I would love to hear them. Iappreciate you guys watching till theend. Till next time. I don't want to letyou down.[Music]Yeah, I know we have fall","Thanks KTC for sending this out a while back! Perfect addition to the setup.

Consoles have really carved in their place for me as I get older. At the end of the day, I like to lay on the comfortable couch and consoles are such a better experience for that. Switching between media apps and games with only a controller is just so convenient
This channel makes me feel like I'm not alone on this. Ever since getting a pc in 2020 coming from being a console gamer my whole life I was molded into someone who would end up shitting on console just because pc gaming is a ""better experience"" when in reality I've come full circle to realizing I enjoy them both but still love my console gaming. Going for trophies, getting to play on a big TV in a more relaxed way I've started to care less about every game running and looking the absolute best and just enjoying games again not being so picky.
The unique things in your videos is the just relaxing way you narrate the whole thing and really appreciate the minimalist approach, kinda the back to home feeling I dream about too after a long day of work.... keep up the great work brother
Your voice and chill vibe to your videos is why I keep coming back. Thanks for what you do.
Another brilliant video, so much good info.
I don't know why I always assumed this room was a studio shed in your backyard. Probably the vintage door. 

In love with the aesthetic
idk if you have watched AOT yet but if not it is a must watch, you just have to get through the first 2 seasons. If you have then Solo is a great option!
Great view from the window buddy, well done for buying oled, sleeping cowboy in the barn
Solo leveling is a must watch. I watch Abit of Invincible and Arcane. Every Sunday, I was chasing the next episode of Solo leveling. Now waiting for Season 3.
I’ve done both console and PC all my life. Sometimes one more than the other. The 90’s were a mix of snes/ps1 and DOS. 2000’s were Xbox 360. Then PS4 and PC. Now more PC than PS5
i would watch Cowboy Bebop. Its worth your time!
Arcane is fantastic! Watching Solo Leveling now with the wife it it's pretty dang good too.
omg motorola razer 
Nice video, dude! Really down to earth one :) Will check this monitor, because that's exactly what I would like to do: PC/Console + Mac. Cables prerouted, just plug in and work and swap between devices! 
P.S. Fellow ow player :) the games and the shows you've mentioned are peak!
Kinda sad this brand isnt available locally to where I am at the moment. Great review btw~! keep it up~!
I also game on console and PC! I also have the first generation PS5 and last year I built my first gaming PC! My suggestion for anime show is definitely Attack on Titan!!! I think you would like it! It has a great story to it! I enjoy your videos, I’m hoping to finally get my channel up and running soon! Have a great day!!!
Probably mentioned in the comments but definitely watch arcane before solo leveling. I've watched both and they're both good but the story in arcane is just something else! Though by all means if you just want a good fun watch without crazy lore then yeah, Solo Leveling is peak.
Hey there, your vids are super chill and cozy love to see them come up on my feed, question how do you get that clock onto your iPad?
You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen Solo leveling. I think you will enjoy it.
PS5 for AAA and AA games and mini pc for indie games for me as 41 YO gamer. Still love pc gaming but don't want to deal with today's insane pc part prices anymore
I’m still waiting on my 5070Ti PC, but from what I’ve been playing on my 3050 6GB Laptop I don’t understand how I was able to sit on a controller for so long and tolerate the weirdness that is aiming in a competitive shooter style game. I’m switching to PC on shooter style games, and console for less aim reliant games.
what kind of chair are you using?
Do you still use the C4 as a monitor?
I saw your comment on spawnpoiint channel about LG 45 5K2K, I'm wondering if you're going to review that monitor?
Great video as always & a great monitor. Just ordered it with your link … I might have missed it but is it VESA compatible?
Hi , great content as always , super chill vibe . I wanna ask do you route rgb light strips only on the back of your desk or on the sides too ? I really want to try some Govee lights ,also do you buy extra diffusers for them ?
Are you going to be getting a review sample of the new LG 5k2k monitor? Really debating returning my LG 32inch 4k monitor for it.
Do you collect any older systems like PS2 or GameCube? Or do you think emulation is the way to go?
Hows thermals on your Asus Nuc for long playing sessions of 3-4 hrs ?
May i know your ipad mini standby time is which app?
Whats the game @7:48
Yo what’s the name of that anime girl background in the video?
video looks like a 720p video, =S no 4k
sorry i dont sub to channels that are fake gamers talk about gaming but nice setup man i only sub too lets plays channels like my self i am a lets play channel as well .
PLEASE GIVE ME VICTRIX PRO BFG I MORE THEN NEED THEN YOU

So, today we have a veryexciting project. If you saw one of myvideos that I did maybe nearly a yearago, I did a manga room makeoverorganization video. And I did thatbecause Flexispot had sent me a reallynice new desk. So, then I reorganized mywhole room. Pretty much rearranged it.And yeah, that turned out really, reallynice. But today, instead of doing myroom, we are going to be reorganizingand rearranging my husband's room. So,he has a I guess like a manga room aswell. Well, it's more like a hobbyrooms. He has like manga anime stuff andalso his gaming stuff. And so, I thinkyou might have seen it if you saw hismanga collection video that I did. Ithink that was over a year ago now aswell. So, I haven't shown you his roomsince, but we have an exciting projectbecause we're going to be rearranginghis room because Flexisport actuallysent me another desk to try out, whichis the E7 Pro. The one that I have in myroom is the E7, not the Pro version. So,they kindly sent me the Pro version totry out. So, we're going to put that inhis room and rearrange his whole room.So, first off, I'm going to show youwhat we're working with. He has notgiven the his room uh a lot of love inmy opinion, especially he's been morefocused on rearranging my room andgiving my room a lot of love. So, we'regoing to do that for him today. And Ihave got permission from him to show youthe state of his room at the moment. So,it's not me trying to shame him oranything. I got his permission and he'sreally, really happy and excited to gothrough this transformation. So, yeah,let's go see what his room looks likenow. Hello. Can I come in? Ooh. Okay. Imean, it's not thatbad. Okay. Let me pass over the mic.What do you got to say? Welcome to mycave. A very unorganized cave. You'vegot loads of like tools here and randomstuff that we've just like put into yourroom. And then you have all your yourfigures and stuff. And then your desk,which this one actually is. It's the 160* 80, right? And this one we bought inIKEA. And then we're going to bereplacing it with a 180 * 160. So, wegot the flexi spot here. Let me let himgive the tour of his room. Hello guys.So, as you can see, I've not given myroom a lot of love, but let's start withthe book shelf. So, the manga shelf. Asyou can see, I initially intended tohave like figures that corresponds tothe series. Very obviously there'sjiu-jitsu kaizen. There's jiu-jitsukaising figures here. And then obviouslyeventually I can probably have kaijuhere and kaiju and all that stuff. Butit's all splattered now. They're allfalling down. They're all fallingasleep, knocked out. There's like randomcrap, you know, like stuff like this.There's super glue there. Like it's it'sit's a mess. It's a hot mess. But it's ashame because you know these books lookreally good like on the shelf especiallythe full full metal alchemist and thatwas probably like one of the best ones.But as you can see and probably from theprevious videos you probably can see Igot these like chunky ones now. So Ineed to consider these now. But yeahthat's basically the shelf. I do want togive it a lot of love which hopefully Ican do today. Next is obviously thisthing. You probably saw in Lydia'soriginal video. She did have thisbefore. I actually can't remember whatyou put on there. Just books. Justbooks. But as you can see, it's it'sit's almost like a dumping ground.Unfortunately, I did want to use this askind of like a storage thing, but then Iwas like kind of conflicted because Ilike the spacing of it. It could be goodfor like box sets and you know all thatstuff. So, as you can see, the top halfis that and the second half is likestorage. And then yeah, see we got theshelf. Super long shelf. I actuallycan't remember how long it is. I assumeis about 180 which is the same length ofmy new table and hopefully it wouldshould cleanly align but we'll see. Andyes, and finally kind of like my desk.So this is the 160 by 80 desk by IKEA.Not going to lie, I've had this for like3 years now. It has treated me well.However, the only ick I have about thisis I if I move the table a little bitlike up and down, it moves a lot. AndLydia, if you like pay attention to thatfigure so which is moreobvious, it moves a lot. So, I I'm agamer, so if I play like very activegames like Apex, I guess it's going tomove a lot. And hopefully the FlexisSpot will fix it. I'm sure it will.We'll test it out. Yeah, for sure. We'lldefinitely test it out. But yeah, I loveI love this desk. Size is great. AndSuki loves it, too. And then moving on,obviously, you know, this is kind oflike a display area. I'm not sure. I'mkind of satisfied with it in terms ofthe quantity. It just needs to beneatened up. Obviously, there's mykeyboards. They were like mini projectsand stuff. And then, you know, my kindof like top tier, I guess, like favoriteart books and comics. The Bornless oneis actually part of a project I'm from.So, I'm actually credited in the comics.So, that's kind of cool. And this isbasically another handme-down fromLyoon. Not going to lie, I did not knowwhat I wanted to do because it was sosudden. And again it's it it has becomea half display half dumping ground whichis really unfortunate because this doesgive a lot of storage I guess you cansay or like display you know there'slike random crap like electronics wiringand all that stuff. So yeah and thenobviously lastly this is kind of like myclothing and t-shirts that are likelimited shout outs goes to Michelle youknow stuff that I really want to kind oflike really look after and got a dumpingground and that's my room for now. Allright. So, I think the plan here is whatyou want to do, right, is move this.We're going to empty this whole shelf.And then we're probably going to move itacross like this to this way to Yeah.rotate it that way. And then we'reprobably going to move thislittle what do you call it? Like bookshelf case thingy. And we're probablygoing to move it maybe this way if wecan over here. and the desk. We're goingto be obviously because the new desk isa lot larger, we're going to need tomove this. But what we're going to dofirst is pretty much take everythingdown, the PC, the monitors, unasssemblethe desk, take it out, and then use thatspace to start building the new desk.And then hopefully then we'll see howeverything fits first. We're going tomove these things, I guess, as well, sowe have enough space to build the desk.So, that's I guess the first plan ofaction is John's going to moveeverything here and we're going todismantle the desk and then maybe startbuilding the new one. Very excited. Weshall see how it goes.[Music]Youknow, Heat. Heat.[Music][Applause][Music]Right. The state of theroom. We're going to have a little breaknow. I made some bacon sandwiches. Hereyou go. Oh, thank you very much. Thisone. Mine. That oneyours. Cheers. Cheers.Using this space for now.[Music]Heat. Hey, Heat. Heat. Hey, Heat.[Music][Music]Oh yeah, it fits. Wow. Amazing.Nice.As hell.[Music]Oo.Ooh, that looksnice. Matches my hair indeed.I've already opened this once.[Music]That looks cool.And I believe this these are like reallypremium prints, I think.Oh, they feel good. Oh,nice. These are really nice.Oh, that one's reallycool. Oh my god, that is socool. Oh, that one's really nice.And actually, maybe I put everythingelse in the box and just have this out.Yeah, you can display the box.That looksgood under there.kind of has to be thisway. No,up to you. Really?I mean, it's cool either way already.opening the new desk. So, this is thelegs of the desk.So, yeah, let's go.[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]All right. So, just a bit of an update.We managed to put the base of the tabletogether. But now we need to affix itthe table top on on it. But to get thetable top upstairs, we have to gothrough this mess. So now I'm just goingto actually start filling the mangashelves so that we can get all this outof the way and bring in the table top.So yeah, let's do that.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]me.[Music][Music]Heat[Music]uphere. Heat. Heat. N.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]down. Feel[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Applause]What else?[Music][Music]Ooh. Hey. Hey.[Music][Music][Music]Ooh. Honey.[Music]It's[Music]perfect. Heat. Heat.[Music]N. All[Music][Music]right. So, we finished organizing themanga shelf and we're ready to put wellready to build the desk finally and putit in. So, we've got the desk up here.So, we're going to open this up and thenbuild itupstairs. Oh my goodness.Ohmy. As I mentioned at the start of thevideo, this particular desk is the E7Pro, which is the next generation deskcompared to my E7. I've had my E7 fornearly a year now, and honestly, it'sbeen gamechanging. The size has beenamazing for filming those top down cleanhall videos and the standing mechanichas been amazing for my health due to mebeing able to walk while I work combinedwith my walking pad. Some of you whofollow my personal channels might knowI've been on a fitness journey and thisstanding desk has really made itpossible in making sure that I get mysteps in every day. The desk is alsoreally customizable where you caninterchange the color of the tabletopand the color of the legs as well as thedesk size itself. Obviously, as you cansee, John chose the legs in the blackcolor and then with a white tabletop. Ihave the one in both white. And he alsogot a much larger desk than me and hegot it in 180 cm length by 60 cm width.The main differences between the E7 andthe E7 Pro is definitely the enhancedstability. It also has a higher weightcapacity at 160 kg and it also has moreheight adjustment ranges as well. Itranges from 63.5 cm to 128.5 cm which isreally great for different user heights.We also noticed while unpacking andbuilding that the cable managementsystem is really good and it comes withan in-built cable management system thatmy standard E7 didn't have. I personallyreally really love my Flexis Spotstanding desk. So, if you're also on thelookout for a really sleek, really good,and highquality desk, definitely checkout Flexis Spot standing desk. I'llleave all the links down below and thelink to this one as well in thedescription box. So, definitely check itout.[Music][Music]That's for sure.[Music][Music][Music]away. All[Music]right, so we've done the big reveal. Howare you feeling about your new space? Ifeel really good. I feel really, reallygood. I feel like I've now maximize theuse of the space. There's so much spacenow, and there feels like there's loadsof breathing room, which is really good.It looks super neat, clean again.Obviously, there comes with perspectiveof what I can improve now. But yeah, no,it looks really good. Can't reallycomplain. In terms of the desk, the deskis super good. This is actually my firstever experience of a standing deskmyself, so I'm really looking forward toit. It's very smooth. I'm not going togo too high, but I'm assuming this isprobablymy standing height around about here.So, if I move this chair allway. So, if I like test Yeah. So, itlooks pretty good. My shoulders are notstrained. Go a little bithigher here. Yeah, this is perfect. Ican also register the height which lidis a pro at. So there's an Mhere and she has set it to mode two. Soevery time So if you move itdown and then I pressand it goes to my automatic height whichis amazing. And you can register yourseating height on number one. And sowhen you move it up to your standingheight, you can put it back to yourseating height instantly as well. So youcan register that once you're ready.Let's see. Okay. So now I'm going to tryand register the seatingheight. So I should be around here.Abouthere.No, I think it's fine because I like toput my arms on my desk. So, this ispretty good. All right. So, then youjust pressM and then press one and then it shouldregister. So, now you can press two andone and it should go upautomatically. We can try the standingheight. So, it's going up. It's goingup. It's going up. It's like a rocketship. And then it stops there. And thenyou can put it on your the one that youregistered on your sitting height. Andthen it should go back down aswell. And then you have both of themregistered, which means it's really,really easy for you to pretty much standup and sit down with ease. So really,really great feature for this one. andhe got the one with the black legs andthe white table top. It's looking reallygood. I think I have to go a littlefurther out to see exactly how itfits. But yeah, it's looking reallynice. I'm really happy for you that youhave a little bit more of a cleanerspace and I feel like you can do a lotmore with it. Especially you have a lotof wall space now. And you have spacedown here as well to fill things. Andthen you have the shelves. So Iorganized the shelves for him. I prettymuch did his vagabon collection up topcuz that's one of his favorites. Andthen Jiu-Jitsu Kaizen and Chas Man,which is the two of the dark three. Andthen I kept the viz media section aswell. Pretty much the same area. Sothey're all together. And then obviouslythe next ones which is for metalalchemist the really nice hardbackeditions in the middle so we can have alook and they're easily displayed. Andthen we have more of the taller vizigvolumes down here. And then more of thevizig down here. And then we were ableto fit in some of his big collectorsdeluxe editions and display the vagabonddefinitive edition which we recentlyhauled in my previous video. And thensome art books and he's got more spaceto put other things as well. So yeah,that is his manga bookshelf. That waslike a mini tour of all his manga.That's all he owns. A little bit lessthan what I earn. Just a little bit. No.Yeah, I am super pleased with the amountof work that we put in. It's been 9hoursish. 9 hours basically, but it waswell worth it. This is definitely like aa really good quality of life, I guess.But yeah, no, it's really good. I'mreally pleased. I managed to display alot of the things as well. I don't knowif Lid has showed you, but basicallythere's obviously the arcane stuffbehind. It looks really good now. andshe had a really good idea from usingthis. I guess you could call it like acloth. Myself and Lid, we did a SquareEnix order and that came for free. I hadno idea what to do with it and she had areally good idea to basically hide theugliness behind it. Feel free to displaywhat's behind it. But yeah, no, it's uhit's a super great idea. So, it's gotlike tools and stuff and wires and stuffand Yeah. No, it's really good. Got myclothes. Got like an easy easier accessof the clothes. Obviously, I would loveto have a dedicated space for like thetote bags, headphones, and my hats. So,I would probably look to hang them onthe wall at some point. But yeah, like Isaid, improvements. And I managed todisplay a lot of my limited editionstuff on the side here in the corner,which I think honestly was a really goodplacement. So, as you can see, that'slike my camera stuff, my Nandroids,limited Androids, and then we gotPersona here. It's like a Persona likefloor, I guess you can call it. Shelf.Persona shrine. A Persona shrine, Iguess you can call it. I think it needsto have a bit more. And then moving onto the FinalFantasy/ Square Enix stuff. Lastly,there's a Bayonetta slot right there.And the figures at the top of the shelfis super clean. Now, I kind of like itas is. I may look to add prints upthere, something a bit more simplisticrather than cluttering the whole shelfwith figures. But that's my initialimpressions at the moment. I'm startinga CFKA shrine as you can probably seethere. Just waiting for the figure toreleaseand it'll be complete. All right, I'mreally tired now. I helped him do a lotof stuff andthen clean up and obviously shelf hismanga, but it was definitely well worthit. And we've talked a lot already now.So, I would just say thank you so muchfor watching this video. I hope it wasfun seeing the wholereorganization. If you want to see mereorganize my room previously, you candefinitely check that out. I'll linkthat below somewhere. But I hope youenjoyed and liked seeing his new room. Ithink he's really happy with it. Are youhappy with it? Super happy. So yeah, Ihope you guys enjoyed. And make sure tolike, comment, and subscribe if youhaven't already for more manga animemerch content. And I will see you asalways in my next video. Bye.[Music]","Just the fact that you both have your own office is wonderful. I am looking forward to the new organized setup.
having separated offices was so good for my marriage, we have quality time together, but also on our own, which is very important. I'm redecorating my husband's office, but he likes brown... a lot lol so it's hard mode. you did such a great job, ty for the video
The honkai star rail, Genshin, persona, zzz merch in his room are perfect I also think his manga tastes are immaculate lmao
Such an aesthetically pleasing room, hehe.
Wow! The ARACANE LOL is nice to have! Nice collection
Miyabi wallpaper, Kafka print, ayaka plush?? Wow he has taste !!!
Besides it being white this is the dream work/gaming/chill set up i always wanted but will probably never have.
You are blessed my friend I hope u know that.
Just FYI for the best posture, for both the standing and sitting configuration, your elbows should be at about an 90° angle. 
So for him for standing 100 is a bit too low, by the looks of it it should be somewhere between 115-130,
OMG I LOVE YOUR HAIRRRRRR
This video is really so good!
SO EXCITED TO WATCH THISSSSS
i love this type bedroom!
That is the coolest hair I’ve ever seen tbh


And the room is fire
Another fantastic video
Lets go,i was waiting for another one
I'm in love with this room. You guys did an amazing job! Greetings from Ukraine!
I have a different Arcane artbook set and the box was also massive. It was way too nice not to display so I had to clear out room just for the Jinx themed box. They really killed it with all the Arcane stuff after having basically nothing for years. 

If he's looking for any more Maki Zenin statues to round off his shelf I'd rec her ArtFX J (with the bonus face). It has one of the more dynamic poses I've seen for her and she's using the playful cloud cursed tool which I don't think gets included as much even tho it was from one of the cooler early arcs.
Attendance check
OMG DREAM ROOM could I ask where you brought the manga bookshelf?
looks awesome!
i love it
Idk why this was on my feed but I love your room!
wow nice pc set up i hope someday i have a pc set up like you have.
A couple whom are both into anime is beautiful to me.. i would be so happy to be with someone like that
7:38 GYAT DAMN
Clean setup
О киса а это уже главное в доме ))
молодцы красиво
This looks so good!! What bookshelf is that?? I NEED one for my manga!
If you guys can. Id anchor that bookshelf to the wall, its pretty wiggly. Just to be safe.
Hey looks nice
my therapy
I think my only disagreement with this room is the clothing rack in the room, as it takes up space and sometimes not that great to look at. Maybe I could suggest getting a Kallax Shelf, then you can fold your hoodies and stack them up on there. Additionally, display other neat things and can get one in white to fit the color scheme nicely.
what is the LG gaming computer called, the different monitors? Also what kind of top did you get? The frame is black, but what kind of top, solid wood?
Sorry if it was asked, but what is the dimension of the space? Great work!
unorganized? looks pretty organized to me lol W vid
35:34 Where is hell's paradise 2 ???
I need to find myself a woman like Lyddie
It's like my room, but with none of this stuff...sigh xD
That tall shelf not being secured to the wall is freaking me out with the space in that room and ur cats. Pls secure it even if it seems unlikely to tip with the weight. Dont wanna risk the goods!
the keyboard under the desk?
Can I know the background screen information?
May I know where I can get that hoshimi miyabi wallpaper? I've been looking around and can't find the exact same wallpaper
Do you know the name of this computer case?
What speakers are those?
5:25 What's the top right keyboard?
what game was he playing? Also awesome video!
someone know the name of that keyboard in 31:25?
I think he might like Miyabi... just a guess
having this play in the background while painting ( •̀ ω •́ )
what job do u do to afford this
11 minutes of putting up books.... riveting...
here me who cant even afford a decent pc . sad
Ok but who did you romance in ff7 rebirth lol
Buy outy p95
日本の作品がいっぱいだ🫶
don't care just fix the lighting to be a good color
Not much of a makeover more of a spruce / tidy up

Bro I have been watching ur vids like a year ago till now! and all I can say is the more I watch ur vids and see how u improve ur gaming house the more respect and admired I become. I wanna say ur undareted asf cuz 125k subscriber for someone that spends alot of money on his vids and make high quality vids is js so undareted. I hope u become more famous and get the fame u deserve. keep it up with ur work and I can't wait till the gaming house is 100%
""Console's not that bad"" 
""oh it is"" 
Had me dying
Love the videos my man! Hope things go well with your kids!
HEY SAMSON, THAT LARGE SETUP THAT YOU SAID YOU PROBABLY WONT USE AGAIN, IM A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY AND I'D LOVE IT AND ENJOY IT FOR YEARS TO COME! (i don't know if this sounds selfish, im just really asking here)
It was epic seeing the transformation and how this amazing new space was put together
bro I'm sorry but that small monitor as the main when you have this crazy curved monitor for like using discord is a crime
first video ive watched of yours man its great cant wait to watch more.
let's not decorate with plants like the average peasant... no, let's decorate with over 3000 dollars in spare parts and keyboards.
Bro I absolutely love your channel,I just started watching your vids a couple of days ago, love from south Africa
Video update please for when that TV falls down. Wild only using drywall anchors.
For your TV there is a great draw wall thing you can get from home depot for like $20. It's called an anchor. (Fliptoggle 1/4 in. x 2-1/2 in. Plastic with Screw). Can hold up 137lbs without studs. I recommend it for dry wall because just using the screws alone on drywall can cause the screws to fall out overtime and that won't be good for your TV. SO PLEASE get those wall anchor.
You missed the strip that goes at the end of your Desktop. I did that too.. it keeps you from having exposed wood at the end of your shiny desk!!
how are you so rich
In which app does he setup the room?
first video ive seen, this was crazy bro well played...well played.
That breath on that 5080 was like a slow knife turn to the back
insane setup bro amazing work wish i had one like this
I gotta be honest. Ive never had the money to get a pc, let alone a room like this and its the only thing i can wish for. And seing a HUGE guy building his (also my) dream room/setup, just makes me wanna build my own dream setup just like this but i dont have the money for it lol. If i didn't say it already, YOU ARE HUGEEEEE. Great video btw! Earned a sub!
7:31 Nah why did u regret Harvard 
That like very smart person dream
It's crazy to think that with 21k, which you spent on your entire room, here in Brazil you could only afford the 4090....But here I am, watching and dreaming.
you forgot a speaker
This came across to my feed, and I watched it til the end, it's an inspirational video and a very motivating video for a small content creator like me, I hope one day I get monetized and build myself a setup like this one! Thank you for creating this wonderful video, and you deserve more subscribers!
10:46 one of those is as much as my hole pc set up
If you were able to plan the room from studs, why didn't you put a piece of wood where the mounts would be? It hurts me. Especially when you spent $30,000.
This is cool but would switch the monitors
13:20 why did the moniter layout make me cringe
15:54 awsome set up but please put the pc part boxes away
Wait, hold up. 1 SSD? That is almost sacrilege. Almost every PC gamer knows to never install a game on the C: drive. We, as PC gamers know that there should always be a second or third SSD drive and the games go there. The launcher can be installed on C: but the game files go on the D: drive for optimal load times like the assets and textures on big maps load in correctly and not dealing with PS2 graphics, waiting for the high-res textures to load in.

Personally, I haven't installed a game on the C: drive since 2006.
yo i need one of the 5080's ive got a damn 1650
Trying to…contain…..the troll, too much caffeine ingested…but my better half wins, kind of

3rd setup?
0:06 the highest NPCs is crazy
damn i think that is a beast of a setup that is sick now im thinking of switching form console to pc that is a sick setup good job on it
You’re a great strong young man keep up the hard work on you’re vids I love them
right after the gaming house is complete have everything running just for an hour and show how much the electricity bill will be haha.
the gaming room looks really nice
That is insane bruh
the third setup could be a decked out simulator. what about that? it woud be SUPERCOOL!
I'm going to be getting a PC soon but I've used console my entire life
what happened to the 3rd set up
I dont mean to sound buzzkill sir, but I think huge windows are security concerns, and I think steel bars/burglar bars can provide security...
you should reupload this and blur out that shipping label on the amazon package
9:02 what music did you use?
""scream when I"", every gamer knows what that means and has had that expierence whether hardcore or casual gamer. LOL
yo bro all the stuff you got is very nice you made me thinking if i should renovate my room
$30,000 you only have like almost 200 K subscribers. How do you afford this man like honestly
First video I've watched of you, already 1 min and 40 sec into the vid and I'm already loving this DUDE, SUBSCRIBED!!!!!!!
Mano, primeira vez aqui no canal que vídeo sensacional, continua assim que você vai muito mais longe, só uma crítica sobre o tradutor do BR está muito ruim, mais tirando essa crítica vídeo está pesado de bom +1 escrito brow 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Don’t stop gaming put a Nintendo switch in there or make a wall and hook a tv up and put a shelf in the bathroom witw different Xbox pro gaming controllers
I sadly have never had a pc but watching you makes me feel like i do!.
Bro needs a gaming gym transformation next
Next build a tunnel under your house into the gaming house
Bro can u do my roomur so good but fr can you
nice room! wich app do you use to animate the room?
Love this channel keep going
You’re like Steve from Blues Clues but for video games cool!
so sickkk
bro i swear he is funny favorite youtuber
first time watching you lol and actually enjoyed the vid keep it up bro
And im a Subscriber for sure
Where did you get the Wood panels from? and how much is each panel? That looks really cool and I might like that for my setup in the future.
been here since the cabin. i mean if i can't afford shit why not watch someone that can. saving up for my dream build but gotta go with a rx 580 8 gb first than maybe next year i'll go for 1080toi 11gb but still 2 months before i can even get my budget build going. than i'll finally be able to game. Going for all black and no RGB, never been the biggest fan of it
I love your humor!!!!!!!
wuts the wallpaper???
buliding a Dream $30,000 Gaming Room!. ""more like a whole house""""
It's funny I bought a Alex drawer and I did the SAME thing build it up side down.
Wow!
Love the setup keep it up
16:20

Which specific remix of ""Back 2 Back"" is this?
Ur gonna get screen burn in with that oled tv's backround (unless its a slideshow which it might be)
I did not know eather net was a thing but now that I know it is I want it
W vid man trying to get my setup like yours one day
When (or if) you have any spare setup parts, can I have them?
me personally cause i like cars i would put car models in the rgb cases
No way you guys actually mounted an Oled screen with just dry wall mounts.. i hope you fix that before the end of the video

I have a lot ofdifferent devices in my setup fromcustom LED lighting, neon fans, PCparts, and keyboards. And in order tocontrol all of that, I need multipleapps, which is honestly really annoying.Now, the fix to this is one single app,SignalRGB. This syncs all your RGBdevices, and it supports over a 100brands. This is the device page. Itshows everything I currently have linkedup. Multiple GOI lights, my Razerkeyboard, fans, RAM, and motherboard. IfI click on each one of these, you cansee it highlights them individually likethis. In order to customize it, all youneed to do is go to the library andselect a theme. It comes with hundredsof free lighting effects like this, andthey look awesome. But if you want totake it even further, you can pay fivebucks a month to access even morefeatures, including reactive effects forgames like Fortnite. So when somethinghappens in the game, cool things likethis happen. Now, go fix your RGB. Youcan find the link in my bio.","Openrgb is open source alternative
The best setup I have ever seen
Does it work on Linux?
Cool room
Not a single part of my pc changed, and I thought asrock would be supported but nothing happened
The ads in signalrgb are annoying
But it stops working when i click off the app
Well, i have the Smart TV 3 Lite, and it doesn't show up at all...
There are more things i have that are supposed to work with SignalRGB that don't show up at all, mousepad too, keyboard WAS supported, still kind of is, but after a little bit it just turns off all of the LEDs and doesn't come on again unless i do so myself.
Don’t work on phones yet
Sadly it doesn't work with my Spectrix S40G ssd and that's a deal-breaker to me
What monitor are you using as main in this setup ? 45"" LG OLED? and is it better than 49"" for gaming? what about your pc specs please?
What's the brand of your gaming monitor ?
Do you have 3 gpu just sitting there will I still have a 1050 ti
WHAT KINDA PC IS THAT

can i get a one graphics card??
Hey @TechTesseract can you tell me what mouse is that?

I have a tiny microphone. Aboutexactly a year ago today, I made a videowhere I built my dream setup. In thatvideo, I took you guys along as I wentthrough my inspiration for decor, builtmy own PC from scratch, which I stillcan't believe I did. I thought it wouldbe fun to make a video giving you alittle tour of all the things that Ihave changed and improved after a yearand also just letting you see all of thethings that I keep in my setup to makesure that it's as cozy as possible aswell as functional. As someone who ispart of the Nosy community, I loveseeing what people keep on their desksand it gives me inspiration and waysthat I can improve my own. So, I thoughtit'd be fun to make one of my own incase you would like to see that as well.Without further ado, let me show you mycozy gaming and workingand everything[Music]setup. Welcome to my cozy setup. As youcan see, I'm really into warm, neutralcolors. I love wood. I love browns. Ialso love a pop of green here and there.So, more than anything, what I strivefor is to make this space as calming andsimple as possible while also being cuteand functional, a place where I canfocus, if you know what I mean. Thefirst thing I wanted to talk about is myAsus monitors. When I was investing inmy setup, my monitors was the part thatI kind of didn't really invest on. Ijust wanted to get something that wasfunctional and inexpensive. And I was alittle nervous that I was maybe makingthe wrong choice by doing that. Buthonestly, I have no issue with these.These are great quality. They workperfectly. No complaints therewhatsoever. I also got this monitor racethat I got from Amazon. For a while, Ididn't quite understand the purpose of amonitor race other than aesthetic andmaking your desk look more put together.And though I do feel like it does that,I really love the way that it looks.I've also learned how much it has helpedmy posture, especially if you'respending a lot of time on your desk.Having your monitors higher and eye viewrather than having to look down to lookat them is good for your push pure. I'mreally a big fan of it. I really lovethat I can put stuff under it as well.It helps keep my desk a little bit tidy.A new addition to my desk is thiscamera. I love this camera so much. Iused to have a Logitech camera and thatone is still really good. But this oneis incredible. It has a really quickautofocus feature which is very helpfulespecially for a stream or if you'rehaving a Zoom call and you need to showsomething on the camera. Also, thequality is just insane. So, I'm going tomake sure to link everything in thedescription. And if I have any affiliatecodes for anything, I'll make sure tolink those as well for you in case youguys are interested in saving a littlebit of money and also helping out mychannel. One of my bigger additions thatI did to my setup was actually thesespeakers. I kind of didn't realize thatcomputers, especially when you buildthem yourself, don't come with their ownspeakers. So I was a little bit confusedabout that. So I realized I had to buymyself some speakers separately. I didthat sometime in the middle of last yearand I have found that to be very veryvery helpful. Has made my setup just alot more comfortable because sometimesyou just don't want to have yourheadphones in want to play music or evenplay a video while you're doingsomething else. It's easier not to belike tethered to your desk all the time.A newer addition as well. that you guyswould have seen me in one of my vlogs. Idon't remember which one, but I willlink that somewhere. But I did add thiscute shelf on top of my desk. I reallylove it. I tried to find something thatwas the same wood grain as my desk. Thisdesk is from IKEA, by the way. It's alittle bit wobbly, but it gets the jobdone, and it's really big. It gets thejob done. I can't stop thinking aboutthat song when I say that. Anyway, Itried to find something that was thesame wood grain as my desk. And alsosomething that was almost as long as mydesk as well, cuz a lot of the shelvesthat I could find were like really tiny.I wanted something that went all the wayalong. I also didn't want to have liketwo shelves. I thought it would justlook more sleek if I had just one, youknow? That's that. I really love it.Even though it's a nice accent point, itdoesn't come out too too much onto mydesk. So, it's more decorative than itis functional, I would say. But that'swhat I wanted it for, so I'm I'm reallyhappy with it. The stuff that I put onmy shelf changes periodically. I'm thekind of person who really lovesswitching things around when it comes tomy decor in general for the seasons, butalso sometimes I get a little bored ofhaving things looking the same for areally long period of time. So, you willnotice this changing a lot throughout myvideos. But right now, I'm really happywith how simple it looks. Maybe I shouldhave something here in the middle, but Ijust haven't had the time to figure thatout. I have a cute little candle. I havemy lavender DS that I got recently formy birthday, and I love it so much I hadto display it. I love the color of it.That's on a little controller stand.Doesn't fit all the way. It's kind oflike crooked, but it gets the job done.I also put this plant here, which I amso so pleased with. It was really,really tiny when I first moved and nowit's gotten so long and beautiful andluscious and I'm really really proud ofthat. In the plant, I do have a littlesmithy. I also got this guy. Oh my god,this guy I got as a Christmas gift. It'sone of those frogs. I don't know ifyou've seen those videos on Instagram,but he is just the most beautiful thingI've ever seen. This is from an Etsyartist. So, I will try and find them andlink that Etsy artist in the descriptionas well if you want to get one of those.They have different kinds with differentoutfits and they're just so freakingcute. Then, we come to the area of mydesk that I feel has changed the mostsince I did my building my dream setupvideo. I've added a lot of fun stuff onthis side that I really, really lovelooking at. The first thing being thispegboard. I am so, so happy with it. Imostly got it to be able to display mykeyboards, and that's what I've beenusing it for. My keyboard collection hasbeen growing, which I'll talk about in alittle bit, but I'm really happy to havea place where I can display them safelyand make them like a feature of my setuprather than putting them in a closet,you know, because they're so pretty. Ihave my Pro controller down here and myNintendo Switch, which looks exactly thesame as it always has. Another newaddition is this beautiful pixel artdisplay that I got sent by D Voom acouple of months ago. And I love that itis functional while at the same timejust being really pretty cuz you can setit up to so many things to help you, butalso there are so many beautiful artthat you can find. I especially love thevideo game ones. They have some Zeldaones that are just incredible. I alsohave a lot of little guys on theshelves. I have this chicken that I goton a trip that I did with friends. Youwill also notice that there's a frogtheme kind of going on. I love frogs andI have a lot of friends who know thatabout me, so they keep giving me frogstuff and it makes my heart so happy.Recently, one of my good friends andviewers gave me this tiny frogknickknack, and I keep it here. Andanother one of my really, really goodfriends gave me this coaster based onone of the emotes in our Discord, and Ilove it so much. I know it's a coaster,but I feel like it's too cute to use itas a coaster. So, I just have itdisplayed here. I also did anothercollaboration with Doom, and they sentme this fast charger. I love it. It's soadorable. It has a pixel display on itas well and it works incredible. So, Ikeep it here on my desk because it comesin so handy whenever I need to chargeliterally anything. I also still have mymushroom lamp. This lamp has beenthrough every single stage of my setup.It still works perfectly. I've had itfor I think at least 3 years. It's socute. It's so perfect. I feel like it'llalways be in my setup in some way. Ialso have this really cool fine finemicrophone. And this has been one of themost anticipated upgrades that I had formy setup. I used to have a really wonkyAmazon mic for the longest time. I knewthat for the quality of my streams, Iwanted to have a better mic. And so, Ihave this fine fine mic. And I reallylove that it has this arm cuz when I'mnot using it for stream or for calls orwhatever, I canjust ta and then it's out of the way.And I love that I still have my samefine fine headphones that I've alwayshad. Hold Pache is using the bathroom.It's like she knows I'm recording andthen she's like, ""Oh, it's time guys.It's time."" But I did want to point outthis headphone clips. They are made by asmall business. I get so many questionsabout them. I will link the businessbelow. And I think one of the mainreasons why my headphones have lasted somuch, it'sthis guy right here. When I got it forthe first time, I was like, is thissomething that I'm really going to usefor a very long time? Like, maybe it'slike a novelty thing and then I won'tuse it anymore. I use it every singleday. So, in case you were thinking ifheadphone stands are even functional, myreview is yes, they really, really are.And I feel like they are one of thereasons why headphones have stayed insuch good shape. Let's talk aboutkeyboards for a moment, shall we? Sorryabout the weird lighting here. As youcan see, I have two very similarkeyboards here on my little display. I'mgoing to give you my reviewish of thesestyles of keyboards. I feel like theseare very popular in the cozy gamingcommunity because they are veryaffordable and really cute. You can getthem off of Amazon and stuff. I will saythough, these keyboards are not the bestquality. If you're trying to find a goodclacky keyboard and you're also someonewho spends a lot of time working in yourcomputer, all of my tech goes throughthe ringer with me because I use it soso much. It might just be a me thing,but these ones have not lasted reallywell for me. Green one just stoppedworking one day. And then this one isokay. Like sometimes some of the keyskind of stick and I have to like reallygo at it to like make it work. Myback. I'm so old. Jesus. I still usethis one because it still works and Ireally love the way that it looks. Butif you're looking to invest on akeyboard, I would say don't get these.You can pay a tin like 20 bucks more andget something that's a little bit betterquality that sounds better and wouldlast you a bit longer. That's what Ithink. And while we're here, I alsowanted to say that one of oneimprovement that I want to do, anotherimprovement thatI just throwing things on the ground.One thing that I want to improve aboutmy desk is actually I want to getanother one of these pegboard thingiesto put right on top of here. I feel likeit'll elongate the desk, but then alsomy keyboard collection has been growing,so I need more space to put them onhere. Another thing that I improved onmy desk is I got a stream deck. I'mactually really grateful because I hadthat on my throne for my birthday.People in the community actually helpedme crowdfund this. So, thank you guys. Ireally appreciate you. This has changedthe game for streaming and it's made itso much easier for me and made meimprove streaming just in general. So,I'm really happy about that. Still liketo keep my iPad back here becausesometimes I have stuff to do in my iPad.I actually recently started drawing myown emotes. So, I've been doing that forthe last couple days and I need my iPadfor that. So, I've been using that. Anddown here, this is this has been a lifechanger for me. I got this at thebeginning of the year. This is a weeklyplanner. I just write down all thethings that I have to do. Keeps meorganized. It looks really nice andsimple and pretty. And yeah, I alsorecently got this mouse pad. I love theshape. I love the color. It's easy toclean and it's there. This is also themouse that came with this keyboard here.It's simple and it's there and it worksso I use it. I recently got thiskeyboard because I'm actually doing acollaboration with a keycap companywhich that video might be out by thetime this is out. So, I will maybe linkit if it's out. I'm really reallyexcited for that. It's like the perfectmatch made in heaven. So, I cannot waitfor you guys to see that. All right,what else do we have? We have mybeautiful and amazing andincredible computer. Incredible.Amazing. Showstoppping. This is thecomputer that I built last year. I mean,there's really not much I can say aboutit. It's a 10 out of 10. I still reallylove it. Patcha also loves it. What doyou think? It's working perfectly. Itstill looks beautiful. It's easy toclean. And yeah, I really have nocomplaints. A new thing that startedhappening after I moved actually was Istarted a silly little magnetcollection. Most of these are magnetsthat have been given to me. So, I justreally love it. It's a really cutelittle way that you can customize yourcomputer and it's just fun to collectstuff. I have this monkey jungle onefrom a place here in Florida, which ifyou live in Miami and you haven't beento Monkey Jungle, you have to. It'sreally It's a really great place. Irecommend especially if you like feedingcute monkeys. I have these egg ones andthis little blob one that were a gift.This snail one was also a gift from aloved one. This frog one was a gift fromNick. If you're watching, I love you.Thank you. This one was a gift from mybrother. And then I have this one thatlooks like Patcha. My legs are hurtingfrom sitting here. Anyway, a new thingthat I did get recently because of someof my comments in that video where Ibuilt this PC, people were telling menot to put it directly on the groundbecause it would get a lot of dustunderneath. So, I actually got thislittle platform to be able to move itaround and clean itbetter. God, that's been really reallyhelpful to move it around for whateverreason. This guy is really, really heavyand I'm always really apprehensive aboutcarrying it and moving it around becauseI'm afraid that I'm going to drop it orsomething. I'm very clumsy. Okay, if youhave your PC directly on the ground,maybe consider getting one of those cuzit's a game changer for me. Hello. Hi.I'm I'm still here. I'm just out offrame. Okay. I feel like in thesestores, people don't really talk aboutthis. The way that they organize theirstuff on their drawers, and I'm kind ofnosy about that. I don't know about you.So, I'm going to show you how I organizethings in my drawers really quick. Okay,in this drawer, this is like the drawer.Oh, there's hair. This where I keep myhair. This is the drawer where I keepall of the things that I need to accesson a dayto-day basis. I have someheadphones. I have my glasses, stuff toremove key caps and clean them, pens,all that good stuff. Erasers, stickers,very, very helpful. I have a wholedrawer filled with fidget toys. I amvery, very neurode divergent and I likefidget toys for that reason. They reallyhelp me focus some days. They help me onstream, all that good stuff. I also havethis random brain cell plushy which ifyou know you know I guess from mystreams. And then back here I have awhole stack of my planners and notebooksthat I use on a day-to-day basis to keepme organized. All of that good stuff.Down here I literally have a wholedrawer of cozy crafting. I mean I have alot more cozy crafting stuff but theseare the things that I reach for on aregular basis. And it's mostly just mycoloring books. I have a lot of them.The Heartstoppper coloring book. It's socute. I have my Hoohoohoo markers andyeah, just like random things that Imight need like measuring tape and stufffor writing letters and stuff like that.Down here, I have some miscellaneousstuff. As you can see, this is mostlyjust where I like to keep my laptop cuzI like for it to have a nice organizedplace for it to be in. And I also havelike a random lighter, my Bluetoothheadphones, and atripod. And then down here, I just haveall of the things that I use for filmingpretty much. I have like an extrawebcam. I have a light. This is where Ikeep my camera when not I'm notrecording, batteries, chargers, SDcards, wires, all of that really fun,not very aesthetic stuff. The last thingI would like to show you is this chair.I did not buy this chair. This was agift from my brother. He had an extrachair and he was like, ""Do you want it?""And I said, ""Yes."" I really love it.It's an extra large, which is a bit bigfor me, but it ends up working out cuz Ican like cross my legs on it and sitlike a gremling as I always do when I'mediting. I still have the same blanketthat I got in my building my dream setupvideo. I think that's it. I also have areally cute cat that sometimes likes tohang out over here. What do you have tosay foryourself? Exactly. All righty. Back tome. When I made that video last year, Ithere were a lot of things that I stillwanted to improve on. And some of thethings I have, some of those things Ihaven't. I feel like a gaming setup is aplace that just naturally improves overtime. This is my happy place. This iswhere I spent most of my time in.Whether it is working, filming, editing,streaming, playing games with myfriends. I hope you like this tour. Letme know what you thought of this video.I would love to hear your thoughts inthe comments. If you like this video,remember to give it a like andsubscribe. But most importantly,remember to take care of yourself. Havesome rest, have some water, and I'll seeyou in the next video. Bye.[Music]","A proud member of the nosey community

As a fellow member of the nosy community, thank you so much for the representation 🫡. And as a member of the aches and pains community thank you as well 

while we were watching this Shane said “poor ili. Born to wear sweaters, forced to live in Florida”.

Seeing the little frog on your shelf made my heart so warm, you’re such a sweetie 

Pacha having to resort to violence in order the get the attention she is entitled to, poor thing at one point I feel like I could see her saying “why are you talking into that q-tip???” 

“This is where I keep my hair” relatable

Such a good update video, thanks for sharing!
Love the subtle changes & additions you’ve made! I love seeing the journey of personal growth & taste being reflected in cozy spaces. 

Also, thank you Pacha for your words of encouragement. They always come at the right time

I was still a kid andfast forward 4 years ago it's my firsttime building my very own self-built PCand today I finally built my gaming desksetup that I thought I would never buildthis minimalistic setup shows thebalance between Simplicity andAesthetics without breaking the bank sowithout further Ado let me show you mygaming desk setup for 2025the center of this gaming desk setup ismy ASUS T F15 the specs of this gaminglaptop is not only decent for gaming butalso for my studies video editingworkflow and multitasking the Intel i51400h and RTX 3050 is still powerful formodern gaming especially if we going toadd the 24 gigs of RAM that it has italso has 1.5 tab of storage which makesit an amazing package and in terms ofperformance on valerant it candefinitely hit the 144 FPS cap of thebuilt-in monitor that has 1920x 1080presolution with 144 Herz of refresh rateand in terms of maxing things out I'vedone it as well on Elden ring with RTXon set to high and all settings set toMax it averages around 47 FPS and thetotal amount I spent on this gaminglaptop is$1,100 including the RAM and storageupgrades so now that we talk about themain character of this desk setup let'sintroduce what One By One The Ts thatrevolves around it for the externalmonitor what we have here is an LG 22inmonitor with 75 HZ refresh rate it'sflicker safe but unfortunately we can'tget advantage of its AMD free syn yeahit's not a gaming monitor becausepersonally I think it would be anoverheal if I would settle for somethinglike that the built-in screen of mygaming laptop is already 144 Herz andthis exact LG 22in monitor as well iswhat I'm using for my Apple ecosystemsetup or maybe let's call it a staticproductivity desk setup for 2025 which Iwill release soon as well by the time Iuploaded this video for sure it willcome out shortly few days after this I'mjust going to put the links to mysubchannel where I will post it or exactlink of that video on the description orjust spin it on the comments once itcomes out but back to this gaming deskset up both of my gaming laptop andexternal monitor are being held by thistwoin one laptop and monitor mount whichI can confidently say that it's durableand it can definitely hold the weight ofboth of them but it can also carry moreweight if we're going to add my V12turbo laptop cooler this kind of setupis optional but what I like to do hereis remove the mount and directly placethe cooler this is all worth it becauseof how insane this V12 is it's a closetype lower style laptop cooler thatsupports 15 up to 22 in laptops whichmakes it a good accessory for hugelaptops even bigger than mine like Tooff17 this is also the same cooler that Ireviewed before that straight down drops33° C of your thermals in just a shortamount of time even your on Max settingslike having RTX on it also has RGBlighting which fits the theme of thisgaming desk setup and you can furthercustomize the Colors by its fourdifferent changing modes and even thebase colors as well has four changeablecolors you have the controls for thatjust located in the center part of thecooler that also has the digitalinformation of your current operatingfan speed this turbo cooler can operatefrom 300 to 2,800 RPM and it's poweredby a 14 cm fan trust me even the 300 RPMcan simply drop your thermals for like 1to three in difference and again it caneasily drop your thermals just like minefrom 96 down to 75° cus in just under 90seconds that stays in there because ofthe memory foam that seals the airintake to just directly go inside yourlaptop and if we're going to talk aboutthe elevation this V12 also has that itsupports twole height stand that makesyour laptop cooler offer more cold windintake to your system the only con forsome people here is it needs to beplugged on an outlet as it's a differenttype of a laptop cooler this has a poweradapter that needs to be plugged in it'sdifferent from what you may know likeUSB powered laptop coolers but again interms of performance it's definitelyneeded as the performance and thermos ofyour gaming laptop when using this V2turbo cooler are going to be amazing ifyou're interested on this product I'lljust put the links in the descriptionagain shout out to Lano thank you forsponsoring this video that's pretty muchit for the left side of this gaming desksetup we can now go on the middle partwhich is somewhat the control center forthis setup for the mouse we got aLogitech lights speeded g304 it's awireless mouse that has two modifiablebuttons it's also powered by a double Abattery and it lasts 250 hours it weighs99 G which makes it lightweight but thebest part here is it supports up to12,000 DPI I think it's a decentflexible Mouse for this gaming setupconsidering I have different dpis fordifferent games or just for normal tasknext to that we have the Royal cludgercade g68 mechanical keyboard it uses ared switch and has three different modeswhich are wireless Bluetooth and wirconnection it's also an RGB backlitkeyboard which fits the main theme ofthis setup it has a total of 13 lightingmodes colors are changeable as well andwhat I really like here is the shortcutsfunctionalities compatibility are bothsupported on Mac and windows to wrapthings up on the middle part of thissetup we have a black desk matat which Idon't remember how much is it but it'sprobably cheap we also have a Maplewooddesk compartment which matches theMaplewood desk table as well both ofthis definitely made the setup cleanerand brings out the nature Vibe of thissetup we also have some notebooks justin case I have to write somethingbecause although this is a gaming setupthere are times that I'm using this aswell as my primary workstation foreveryday stuff moving to the right sideof this gaming desk setup we have someaudio related stuff here first is theMarshall Amberton which is a portableBluetooth speaker it's a quality speakerthat excels so much on base sound andhas a good amount of battery life thatlasts for more than 10 hours on maxvolume we also have a wirelessheadphones which is the Sony wh CH 520it's an entry-level headphones but thequality of the sound output is goodenough especially if I want to hear theaccuracy of my tone for my voice oversit really decent the only problem couldbe its comfortability issues which I'mnot a fan of I use this always for longhours and it does hurt my ears a lot dueto its pressure but everything else likeits battery life that lasts for 2 daysor probably more than 50 hours it's agood addition to this gaming desk setupfor some design related or just feelerson this setup we have a warm light desklamp which has few levels of light thatcan be controlled by this knob but Idon't like the fact that it needs to beplugged on an outlet we also have aauthentic action figure from one of thebest anime series that I like which ischainsaw man this is a Max Factory figmadenji figure which is a cool characterdesign especially its chainsaw man formit's worth buying if you're trying toget into animation or Anatomy just likeme but the catch is it's a veryexpensive one let's go back to thefunctioning side of this setup we have arazor siren mini as the microphone I'veused this for years already this is whatI've been using for trash talking backwhen I'm still playing a lot of videogames it's definitely a decent widecompact condenser microphone and whatyou're hearing right now is this exactmicrophone as well I've just put somefilters and enhancements and you getthis especially if I do record audiocloser just like this I would say it hassome quality of podcasting or cinematicaspect that you'll find on thosesomewhat professional audio stuff it'srelatively cheap which makes it one ofthe most worth buying parts of thisgaming desk setup to further enhance theitic looks of this gaming desk setup wehave some plant decorations that totalsto around $6 it's all fake but itdefinitely made the setup more livelierand that has a good contrast as wellwith the light Walnut Wood slates that Isticked on the wall it contributes tothe nature Vibe of this whole gamingdesk setup to finish things off we havethe ambient lighting for this gamingdesk setup we have some rechargeablelight cones that has a three differentcolor modes I use the warm light atnight when I'm studying and progrramming the white lights are for someoffice kind of vibe the good thing is itcan last close to a day when fullycharged but if it's gaming time alreadywe have some RGB LED light bars on theback which I've attached behind themonitor to give some lumination toincrease my FPS I don't know about thatbut always remember RGB equals FPS andwith all of that this gaming desk set upis complete I hope you enjoyed thisvideo drop a like if you did but if youstill want more of this make sure tosubscribe to to this Channel and to mysub Channel as well because that's whereI'll upload the other desk setup thatI'm going to be releasing it's relatedto productivity

dude the vibes is just so cozy, lakas maka aesthetic haha
I have the same laptop cooler for my Acer Predator Helios 16, with i5 13th gen and RTX 4050, it has a huge contribution in lowering the temps ! Must have for every laptop gamers.
I really like ASUS TUF A15 but considering the Lenovo LOQ 2024 i5 12450HX, RTX 4050 variant because it's cheaper, more powerful and really has that minimalistic feel to it. Though I don't usually go around glazing aesthetics. Yes, I am aware of the concerning Motherboard issues, but I think that the issue has become less likely to happen since I don't see anything about it anywhere.
Bro i need link of your monitor mount please
Angas ng set up mo idol , pwede po ptulong paano iset up nitong Armoury Crate for my better gaming experience sa Asus TUF15 ko dn ?
Sir Hermez, Ask ko lang sana po may laptop din po ako same sa inyo po. Ask ko lang sana ano na Thunderbolt cable gena gamit mo po?

fullgaming setup and after spending $800we're going to see if they're actuallyworth it all right y so yeah you guyssaw the intro you guys heard the introwe're just going to get right into itthough grab our phone and go on Amazonright now and yeah I'm going to pull upthe screen right here that what I'mlooking at but we're on Amazon right nowyou can see we're on the website uh themost important thing that we need isactually a gaming PC though I mean whatelse is going to power this setupbesides a gaming PC so let's just searchthat scroll down a little bituh the overall pick is actually a cyberpower PC right here um yeah Amazon'sChoice overall pick as you guys can seeuh this one is$650 it has a ryzen 5 5500 and an RX6400 so yeah not bad um Amazon's choiceso guess it doesn't really matter whatthe specs are we're going to have to getit regardless so yeah let's just addthat to cart and let's go on to the nextthing so yeah now we need peripheralsfor the gaming setup obviously we havethe PC now we need a keyboard and or amouse so let's just search up gamingkeyboard um overall pick right here okayuh well this one is the red dragons101 gaming keyboard this thing actuallyhas 46,0 340 reviews so this isdefinitely the overall pick but it alsocomes with a mouse as well so we're notgoing to have to get a mouse I guess wehave to add a cart we don't really havean option at least we have this 15% offcoupon that it gave us but yep let'slet's just add that to card I guess whyam I even doing this video right now I'mI'm going to go broke really quick guysif your gaming setup is always a messwith controllers everywhere Tangledcables and just no space for yourheadset you need this this right here isthe my thing Logic storage rack and it'sthe all-in-one storage rack that keepsyour gaming gear organized and easy toaccess it's built to hold everythinglike your PS5 Xbox switch controllersheadsets and even your keyboards so itjust clears up so much clutter what Ipersonally love about this storage rackis that it's built to last the heavyduty metal frame can handle your entiresetup so it can hold many heavy itemslike monitors or anything like that plusthe ventilated design keeps yourconsoles cool while you're gaming andthe best part about it is that it'sactually on Wheels so it's super easy tomove around and you can actually lockthe wheels if you want to so if you guyswant a cleaner and more organized gamingsetup make sure to check out my thinglogic with the first links in thedescription but now the next part of thesetup that we're going to need is agaming headset so let's just go aheadand search that up now there's a lot tochoose from for sure but here is theoverall pick it is the Razer black sharkV2 X gaming headset so I think it's acollab or something like that I don'tknow but it's just a razor headset umyeah it's black meant for PC PS4 Xboxanything $38 so basically $40 but againwe don't have an option so let's justadd this to cart and uh go on to thenext thing I almost completely forgot weactually have to get a monitor I'mthinking about all like the other proofrules but yeah let's search up a gamingMonitor and just see what monitor comesup um scroll down a little bit scepterthat that's funny I actually alreadyhave this monitor so it looks like I'llbe able to save a little bit of money onthis video but yeah this is a sceptercurve 24.5 in gaming monitor up to 240HZ it says but yeah I already got it sowe're not going to add that deart yeahlet's just go ahead and uh go to thelast thing of this setup which isactually the mouse pad um I wouldn'trecommend getting one from Amazon getmine right now in the description butanyways this is for the video purposeswe're going to search up a gaming mousepad so let's see what comes up here umscroll down a little bit again and thisis a basic one it's just a steel seriesuh QC gaming mouse pad$15 um add the cart so um yeah now wehave everything in the cart right hereas you guys can see we're going toproceed to check out but I'm going to dothat off camera so yeah you guys can seeright here I'll just show you on screenthat is atotal right thereso go ahead and buy that anduh there goes my wallet I'm just goingto go ahead and wait two days for allthis stuff to come in for you guys it'llbe like 2 seconds but let's just goahead and cut to that two days later allright y'all package just came in there'sone there istwo well I can't even keep them up buthere is three and now we got to bringout the big gun so give me a secondthere wego this thing is huge all right soeverything is here we're actually goingto start off with the keyboard and mouseAmazon's Choice bundle right here gamingEssentials is what it literally saysright here um I don't know if Amazon'schoice is my choice definitely not butlet's just get this opened here we goand I'm pretty sure the mouse is stillin heresomewhere yep there it is came right outof its packaging so yeah let's see howthis feels thoughthis is going to be an interesting onefor sure first of all it doesn't helpthat I'm 68 cuz uh this mouse a littlesmall it's going to have to doregardless hopefully the keyboard is notworse than that but only one way to findout righthere all right well this is going to befun this is going to be an interestingvideo but this is the keyboard righthere you guys can see it'sliterally a membrane keyboard so it'snot going to be the best feelingkeyboard to play games on but it's goingto have to do 46,000 people bought it onAmazon and it's Amazon's choice so it'sgoing to have to be my choice for thisvideo so yeah let's just go ahead andget this headset out of here Razer Idon't think Razer can disappointhonestly plus this thing actually wasn'tthat cheap for a headset so wow theyliterally got the wires in like thesesleeves right here uh this is theheadset up close andpersonal if it would focus there therewe go you guys can see it I mean itdefinitely doesn't look bad it alsodoesn't feel bad either it's got a lotof cushion on the top you can see likethe razor thing on top there yeah let'ssee how this feels though hold on it'sdefinitely too small yeah no literallyit's like the same exact headset it's alittle bit lighter and more comfortablethan like the czor SG 500 headset yeahanyways let's go ahead and go on to theuh mouse pad super simple steel steelseries quick mouse pad right here um Idon't know how to open it I'm not goingto lie pull it out now here it is umyeah uh on the bottom of it it does havea cool little design it's like the steelseries logos but it's just a basic blackmouse pad definitely big enough for surefor a mouse like let's see how thisfeels definitely feels a little bitcheap it doesn't even have Stitch edgingon the sides but yeah I mean it doesn'tfeel that bad we're going to have to getused to it but but now it's time toactually unbox this Behemoth of acomputer that can barely fit in theframeso we're going to have to actually standup because it's too big to open up likethat okay guys literally right here Ican see that this thing came with akeyboard and it also comes with a mousebut it's buried in there I'll pull itout in a second but literally I'm prettysure this keyboard is better than theAmazon's Choice One just great Ihonestly don't know how I'm going topull this out though I'm going to haveto figure it out all right yeah there wego high IQ play right there here we goyeah and here's the mouse it was at thevery bottom right here uh right therebut yeah I'm really just trying to seethe Aesthetics of this PC right here manI will say the packaging though isactually a lot better than a lot ofcomputers that I have unboxed beforelike it's just like more premium qualitystuff but here we go finally we goteverything out of here and this is thePC right here go and swing this openthough oh about to hit me there we goyou can take this other packaging out Ihonestly kind of like the design of TheSwinging Doors just not for this videocuz like kind of stuck behind the thething here um we're going to we'reactually going to plug it in though soyou guys can see theRGB there we go turn it on just likethat it doesn't come with a RGB remote Ididn't see one anywhere so the RGB rightnow is just purple but I'm pretty surethere's a way to change that maybe eventhis button right here does that ohwould you look at that it actually doescan we go toRGB we need we need red blue and greenshere we need all of it finally I thinkwe found some type of RGB version italso has RGB right here which is prettycool but yeah we have the CPU Coolerright here we also have 16 GB of RAMit's 2 8 GB 6 you know what guys I'mjust going to switch between this andthis so you guys can see but yeah wehave the CPU Cooler right here the ryzen5 5500 CPU everything looks pretty coolit also has the RX 6400 GPU right thereas you guys can see it also comes with a500 GB SSD which is somewhere in thereand it also comes with Windows 11in there yeah overall Aesthetics of it Ithink it looks pretty good I could takeall this little plastic wrapping butit's just easy for you guys to see whenit's opened but yeah uh the only thingthat's kind of weird is like how it'slike metal right here like silver whichis I I don't know I don't know how Ifeel about that honestly but yeah italso has some packaging still under herethat I didn't get out so yeah guys Imean you guys can see uh everything butme but this is the uh full Amazon'sChoice gaming setup so we're going to goahead and uh get everything set up foryou guys and then play some games youknow see how good this PC actually isand if Amazon's choice is approved formy choice so let's go all right guys weare on the PC right now we just loadedup Minecraft we're going to be doingmultiple games for just a comparisonjust to see like how good the FPS is butyeah we are in Minecraft right now we'rejust going to go into a world I justcreated see how much fps we can actuallyget on this thing and just loaded in tothe world and right off the bat we'regetting 700 FPS doing nothing I'll showyou guys my settings it's literally thedefault settings render distance is at12 and stuff biome 5x5 this headset alsosound quality isn't bad like I can justtell like it's not like the cheap onefrom Team I was talking about earlier sosound quality is pretty good on these uhheadphones um but yeah we're going to goactually just like down into this caveand see how much fps we can get we'realready getting 1,000 and we're not evendown in the cave yet yeah let's just goall the way down here let's just go asdeep as we can go in this cave get askull torch going there we go all rightright so in the bottom of this caveright now with a skull torch we aregetting1,500 FPS you're going to be able to runsuper high quality shaders you couldprobably run like really really goodshaders on Minecraft for sure uh cuz Imean even flying around like renderingstuff out in the distance you can seewe're getting well over 300 or yeah wellover 300 now which is actually kind ofcrazy it's Minecraft though I mean youcan't be surprised it's literally one ofthe easiest games to run on a computerbut uh yeah with that being said I thinkwe're going to take it into valerantnext um we're definitely going to beplaying fortnite as well so make sureyou guys stay tuned in the video butyeah let's go ahead and go into valerantnow and just see how good this PCactually is all right guys valerant itlooks like we are getting um 230 FPS onaverage which is honestly less than Iexpected but it might oh okay it's 300around 300 that makes a little bit moresense now I'm not used to this Mountsensitivity so if you see me Miss a lotof shots that is definitely the reason Iwill say the mouse is by far the worstpart of this video it is so unergonomicshaped it's also just not a comfortableMouse like it's like the rubber on islike hard there's like actually norubber on like the grips so it's like aholding just like a piece of plastic inmy hands the keyboard honestly doesn'tlike it's membrane but it it hasn'treally given me problems mainly becausevalerant you don't really need akeyboard where you have to press a bunchof buttons so for a game that's notsuper intensive where I have to likeslap all the keys all the time it's it'snot a problem it's just a norm feelslike a normal keyboard right now itactually kind of feels satisfying I'mnot going to lie might be a bad thing tosay popped them oh shoot bro you can'tpull out your knife one time in DeathMatch all right there we go finallygetting some kills actually find somepeople oh yeah I don't know how I didn'tjust die right therejeez wow that's the worst kill ever hadin my life oh my goodness I do notdeserve to kill that guy it literallykicked us out of the game really quickso we're just going to the range uh justto play around for a second oh yeahwe'll definitely say like you can seelike I can definitely play on it noproblems at all PC is super goodhonestly I mean for a pre-built computerit's like what you expect to get for$650 like I play on some $500 gaming PCsthey usually get about 200 FPS invalerant this one's getting 300 yeah Iwonder what the Amazon's Choice gamingmouse is cuz that would probably be alot better and even the mouse that camewith this computer is way better thanthis thing right here like if you guysjust can't tell like it's poop but I'msticking to it I got to use it for thisvideo so yeah I mean you guys saw a goodamount of gameplay Val right there yeahlet's get out of here let's go to somefortnite and uh really see how thiskeyboard and mouse hold up I think thePC is going to be perfectly fine butwe're going to see how good we can playwith this keyboard and mouse we justloaded into fortnite our FPS is actuallycapped at 120 so we kind of I kind ofwas worried there for a second but asUNCA this thing330 FPS looking in the sky in Creativeum let's just build with this thing ohmy goodness oh this is bad this mouse isactually so bad dude I I don't think Ican actually use it hold on let me lockin let me just try to lockin this is actually so hard I don't Idon't even know I don't know what it isit just makes it so hard to like likehold because okay I think this is whatit is I think it's because it's plasticright here so whenever I'm holding itI'm just constantly like slipping offand then these buttons arealso these buttons are also like kind ofhard to press as well and it's just it'sjust cheap I guess I'm not going to talkabout anymore in this video if I talkabout it one more time everyone dislikeinstantly okay 20 over 200 FPS whilebuilding in Creative so we're definitelygoing to be able to get like 144 in gameso yeah let's just go ahead and takethis into a game I guess surprisinglythe keyboard's not bad looking at itit's the most basic keyboard ever butit's really not that bad it's justmembrane oh person right here oh he'sone HP got him let's go another one uphere as well he dipped he dipped back inthe house yeah one over 144 so like 180pretty much so you can have 180 HZmonitor in pubs so that's pretty good ohhello wow thisdude oh no way no he's actually on oneHP dude no waybro oh no way no way he was solow oh my gosh he was low too let's godead let's go dude oh anotherone acceptit guys maybe I lied about theseheadphones cuz I didn't hear that guy atalloh my gosh that's clutch that is clutchwe had no mats and we killed a personwith a shotgun wow we had no morereboots as well I I mean we have sixkills we're not doing bad this mouse isreally selling oh dang it I talked aboutit again I wasn't supposed to that's onme and we're getting rushed by anotherperson oh no guys this might be it Ican't I can't lie to you guys this mightbe itoh no no we're dead he had the same ideaas me to go up that stair dang it dudehe we got six kills honestly thiscomputer really isn't that bad at alllike averaging over 150 FPS in game nostutters like it's not anything likesuper bad or noticeable you guys can seeit for yourself I definitely I don'tknow I can see why it's Amazon's choicefor sure all right guys so yeah you guyssaw it honestly for an Amazon's Choicegaming setup it wasn't that badliterally the only thing I'd recommendchanging is the uh keyboard and mousebundle just get a separate keyboard andmouse um keyboard really wasn't that badbut you can just see it's like a verybasic keyboard um I mean definitelyusable but the mouse was absolutelyterrible like the whole time like myring finger was hurting like right hererubbing up against it um and yeah it'sjust not very ergonomic so not for me atleast personally the headset not too badI'd say it's like mid um and the PC fora pre-built computer probably like an 8out of 10 definitely a very good PC italso looks pretty good aestheticallylike you look in here everything lookspretty good with the RGB fans you gotthe RGB right there too it is super bigthough I will say it's like massive butit definitely performs pretty good forthe price for a pre-built computer I'malways going to recommend building onefor the price but you know if you don'twant to definitely this one is worth itbut yeah just a reminder to check out mything logic and their storage rack withthe link in the description uhdefinitely a very good way to store anyof your gaming items that you have andit also looks pretty cool on display butum yeah also check out the videos hereand here cuz YouTube recommends them andI recommend them and you're going tolike them so click on one of them rightnow but yeah nonetheless make sure youread your Bible and

isthe world's largest gaming monitor as Itry to build the largest gaming setupyou have ever seen some of these itemsyou won't find in any other setup like a98 in TV or maybe a PC so heavy it takestwo of us to carry and so much more butif I really want to build somethingmassive I have six items I need to orderstarting with the keyboard world'slargest gaming keyboard wow I'mabsolutely butchered that one red dragonk605 this thing is absolutely massive itis 200% the size of regular keyboards atthe cart so next we gothuge huge gaming desk okay hear me outhow big are the Ikea butcher blocksfirst time ever spelling somethingapparently okay hear me out Quin whathappens if we build one on the front oneon the left one on the right to make aU-shaped desk going to put togetherthree desks to make one Mega desk addthecart right huge mouse wow pretty bigmice well then this this might be itthis might be it I mean at least we gotan ergonomic design but bro look how bigthis is on her hand add the cart allright but for our main monitor I know wealready have the TV downstairs it ispart of theirxl90 line any true gaming setup doesn'tonly have one monitor it has a secondarymonitor so that's where we're going togo you got a bunch of 49 in oleds onthere Odyssey Neo but we want somethingbigger what about the Odyssey art sothis thing is coming in at 55 in 4k 165HZ I mean at this point you might aswell just classify that as a TV add tocard we got a lot of power in thisgameing sets the most important we gotto find a massive PC let me see here 10biggest cases in 2025 so I have beenreading a lot about this one so it's theCorsair9000d so as you can see it can fit up to18 fans accommodates six ssds five hddsthis thing actually before you build itit weighs in at 65 lb and they have anestimate once you get this fully loadedit's over 100 lb just for the PC casedud look at that look how much roomwe're going to have in that okay epicart 500 bucks for just a PCcase this is great how much have youspent so far well you were supposed tohave the money tracker above us oh sorryyeah put that up thank you now that wehave the PC case we just need to finishbuilding out the PC and since we'realready on corsair's website I'm goingto go ahead and grab a power supply anaiio some RAM and all 18 fans for thiscase but don't worry we still have thetwo most important pieces being an theI9 14900 k and a 4090 graphics card Idon't think I've ever seen moneydisappear from my wallet as fast as itdid right there but thankfully all weneed to wait for is for all this to shipout now I think this setup is going tobe a tad bigger than what we'reexpecting I mean we did get our 18 fansin here you got the 55in Odyssey Arc butthere's one thing that I have to mentionis whenever your PC case says carefulit's heavy and on the side it says itrequires a team lift you know things aregoing to get a little crazyoh wow what a PC case this PC buildscares me though because between a 98 in4K TV as our main monitor to oursecondary monitor being a 55 in 4kdisplay I don't know how this PC isgoing to hold up but before we get tothe build I have to give a huge shoutout to Corsair for partnering with us onthis video because they ended up sendingus a piece C case a power supply Ram AIOand don't worry we didn't forget aboutthefans oh crap and just in case youwondering 10 12 14 16 18 plus yourradiator plus three fans on the GPUthat's you're going to have like 25 fansin this thing but the final spec listboast that this is one of the fastestPCS that you can build right now I meanbetween a 14900 K processor to 4090 GPUand clocking in with 64 GB of ddr5 RAM Idon't think this puppy will have anyissues handling multiple 4K displays nowthat we tested the PC and we got it onon the very first try you're going tohave to trust me on that one we're goingto take it back down build the rest ofthe setup now you may be wondering toyourself man it looks a little bitdarker like the sun kind of went downand wow they installed the secret gamingroom entrance doors no we weren't uphere that long we literally justfinished clearing out the entire livingroom here in the gaming house so youguys better like this video Andsubscribe but now we got to add in thebase of it the gaming desk now to standout from your overused typical Ikeagaming desk we put three of these badboys together to make sure we had enoughspace for this massive setup well nowthat we got the desks all set up thatonly means one thing it's time to getthis party started and get our gamingsetup on it first up is our Shack sizedkeyboard and like I mentioned earlierthis keyboard is 200% larger than yournormal keyboards how am I supposed touse like w ASD to move and jump but nextup we got the massive scroll wheel ofdeath now I would be lying to you if Ididn't say this piece of the setupscares me the most because it doesn'tmove like an ordinary Mouse but ratheryou use this big red ball right here tomove your cursor around which is goingto make my life miserable trying toscroll across two massive displays thatwe just installed combining for153 in of displays just because I don'tthink you guys realize how big thiskeyboard is this is you this is the guyshe tells you not I mean I'm so sorrynow that we got our peripherals andmonitors installed it's time for themain event the PC but let me remind younow that we have the PC fully built outit is weighing over 100 lb I mean it'sso large you can fit a whole other PCinside of it and not to mention it makesall the components inside lookabsolutely tiny and I would like toremind you guys this is a 4090 in thisbuild it doesn't get any bigger thanthat but this is where we ran into ahuge issue as we were getting everythingconnected I realized that both the TVand the Odyssey Arc monitor were HDMIports and the graphics card that'scurrently in my PC only has one HDMIplugin so after hours of trying tofigure out a solution we ended upconnecting everything through theSamsung hub which I know sounds like asimple solution but as we were trying toget this connected the Samsung hub didnot want to display both monitors to myPC but let me tell you guys wherethere's a will there's a way so we wereable to figure it all out and still ableto use the main TV for our game and ofcourse have that ultimate brain rot ofSubway Surfers on the secondary monitorall right it's the moment we've all beenwaiting for it has been hours the sunhas set it is literally dark outside butwe have the entire setup ready to go sothe last thing we got to do is puteverything to the test and see if we canactually just get one kill I know mostof the challenges are like hey can youwin a game of fortnite no if you don'tsee that Mouse over there and thatkeyboard we're going for one kill to seeif anything in this setup is actuallypractical now we have been talkingNon-Stop about how big this setup wasbut I didn't realize how difficult thiswas going to be a game on it until I satdown I mean the keyboard itself was sobig I could barely press two keys at thesame time and don't you dare even get mestarted on this mouse pray for me Joelgreater or lesser than 3% that I get akill on the first drop in probablylesser but I'm glad you have so muchconfidence in me oh my gosh dude are wedropping boys I'm not even worried I'mnot even worried we're getting a solid30 frames up there so do you feel likeyou're at the advantage absolutely not DI can hardly press e to pick up a weaponon this thing oh mygosh this is so bad I think this is abottoo 3% my rear end did I go against abot just maybe but now that I haveconquered our first obstacle of seeingif I can actually get a kill on thisthing let's see how the rest of thematch goes my hands are cramping up Idon't know if I can finish the wholegame I can't even go and press m for themap look I can't run and press M Iliterally my pinkies cramping pressingshift oh they don't even know you knowwhat I think we're just going to go forthe win that's it this setup isUN that really went differently in myhead all right if we were to categorizethis entire setup to least the best I'mgoing to go the worst thing in the setupit's the mouse that thing is unusablebut then that keyboard I mean the factthat I was like literally trying get mypinky to hit shift to run not usable PCTV monitor I mean all these things arestuff that people normally use overallthe setup I probably won't be playing onit again just because of how impracticalthe screen size is also but if you guysare looking for a screen size that isplayable make sure to check out mymonitor video here but we'll see you onthe next one,"0:37 dilido toys is crazy
RIP electricity bill
For a house that size, you definitely need a setup like this.
This setup remembers me off when I was a child and how I saw the world
I'm just glad there's someone on YouTube to test the set ups that us people say what if
We see that search history
5:53 Bro forgot about the chair
I am a first time viewer but i actually love this, i loved the vid and everything but i would recommend if you could use it as a racing simulator with the huge screen it would be amazing. That’s all best of wishes!
No big chair :(
that PC is actually insane - amazing video brother
i would be sleeping on the couch if i purchased these lol
You know when small kids use adult size stuff and you're all like ""aww how cute!"" 
Ridiculously fun to watch you pain through it haha
Also the gaming house looks beautiful bro!
3:38 just in CASE (pun?)
W chair
2:42 bro a 4090 from ebay
0:37 human [______] is crazy
-Wants to build a ""massive"" pc

*doesn't buys a threadripper

Nah man, that's not going to be massive at all
Wow this was MASSIVE! it really got my LOW expectations high, and made my views on a normal PC TAPER and FADE
Tiny Chair ?
7:26 You had your fps locked
What about the 50 series?
+99 missed calls from shaq
Why 30fps with 4090?
6:25 The largest chair?!
Underrated channel, you definitely deserve more subs
trackballs, for those not used to them, do take a bit of time to get adjusted to. And like gaming mice, they also have adjustable DPS settings which would make it easier to use.. i hope you didnt give up on it.. Personally, I want someone.. ANYONE.. to make a gaming capable clone of the old $20 Logitech Trackman Marble (the slightly larger than a normal mouse with the trackball in the center front, and buttons on either side of the ball.) I get Gameball makes one, but $200 for one isn't in my price range

i get the theme of the video was biggest everything. but I have to guess you did swap back to a standard sized KB and mouse afterwards
The min Fan Speed was never more important
This reminds me of MrWho’sTheBoss really cool! Little expensive though lol
Just my thoughts. 

Not the largest gaming PC setup and less enjoyable than other options. Start with modular displays that have high pixel density. Expensive yes, but when there is a problem you replace a part instead of replacing everything. Also can always add/remove panels or create a non standard display shape (can be useful).

As for the PC setup itself. Start with motherboard stands and mount to the frame of modular screen setup, creating custom mounts for pc parts (video cards, HDs, extension cards, etc.) with standoffs and aluminum extrusions. Hide HID pref cabling in the display frame to the desktop and a single cable to a dock or USB extensions for dongles.
the tower 900 here! maxed out. my pc weighs 100 pounds. my monitor is the acer predator 43 inch and I'm running klipsch 12 inch 600 watts subwoofer with monitors at 200 watts. Welcome aboard to the massive pc users.
0:17 did you say Massive
wOw!!! that's a dream set-up for me. Thanks for sharing...
Put a Mini ITX parts into this case.
Should ran dual 5090s that woulda been INSANE
Aside for the cool setup you've got an amazing physique man congrats !
why no Ryzen i9 processor????
this video deserves way more views and likes
this setup is very MASSIVE. just like my LOWWWWW TAPERRRRR FADEEEEEEE
@5:35 this is just embarrassing as a pc builder
Why not amd? r9 9900x?
surprised you didn't go with threadripper. 64 core 7980X is the obvious choice
Calling a trackball a mouse 

But in all reality, switching from mouse to trackball comes with a decent learning curve, especially to an office/productivity one like the Ellecom Huge. Ellecom's Deft Pro has much better ergonomics for gaming!
I'm gonna lie bro, this is sick
You could make a beast pc with this massive case
8:30 Normalyyyyyyy!!!! Huhhhhh Bro i have a 2060
We got shaq's gaming setup revealed 
Btw love the vids
That PC ain't having heat problems for a entirety
Ngl this deserves more views
I just saw this same big monitor at Best Buy and would definitely buy this if I could
Bigger does not equal better. I find it much harder to take everything in on a monitor that's too big for my field of vision.
holy crap how is this video and channel so underrated
This guy deserves more views this was a very expensive build
Nah the electricity bills abt to be wildin
BRO YOU’RE MISSING THE WORLDS BIGGEST CHAIR ??..?
I’m tryna get that desk!! Where is that from!?
I have the odyssey ark too , I need to hit the gym cause u lifted it up on the desk like it was nothing
It looks like you made a mini itx build in an atx case
why no one on youtube has made a comparison video of odyssey ark with other odyssey models... its so confusing at this point. the only plus point for me in odyssey g9 is that it has oled , other than that everything is better in odyssey ark... can you pleaseeeee make a comparison video of comparing other monitors with odyssey ark? pls pls pls there is no one else on yt who can afford it ig
Where’s the chair!
am i tripping or did you pair a 750w psu with an i9 and 4090?! the 14900k alone pulls like 500w.
Lol that massive setup with a little stool
Damn bro 
Its worth the watch but damn
Prices be much
Imagine donating 1/10 of all expenses to one minor YouTuber
why not a 9800 x3d
How could the largest gaming setup not have a projector to project an IMAX-size screen?
3:34 One man, a lot of fans challenge
This is the kind of setup that Shaquille O'Neal would have
you should put a smart bulb so you can change the colour of the room and then it will look like a gaming room
BRO IS GONE MAD
Insanely Outstanding....
New fan here..
Your videos are so amazing sir. Keep it up for making new contents ..
My pc case is about half size and it takes at least two people to lift it. Imagine how many people it takes to move this
Whynnot get a display port to HDMI adapter/cable? It took me 2 mins to figure that out when i first started with my rx 580
Bro that setup was Massive
Bro forgot about the 5090
Video Is Good obv
But His Arms got me inspiration !
Give this gaming set up to Shaquille
You forgot the hugest gaming chair buddy.
great video !!!
why not a threadripper?
next time use a cable with HDMI on one end and Display on the other.

This was so well edited and produced! Was shocked that you are a newer YouTuber. I love the cadence and slower/relaxed speed of the voice over, it’s super refreshing (esp for these types of videos). Can’t wait to see what’s next for your channel
Really nice bro seems a clean and neat setup made on a budget 
Great work keep it up
I love this bro
Mad setup brother, you have earned a follower here from Malaysia!
Great setup, I’m like watching Mathew Encina of modekeyboards, keep it up brother..
this is so inspiring sir! Someone from Philippines!
Amazing setup!
it looks great man! great job!
Nice setup, really liking the wood
awesome bro .inspiring
W vid, your channel is about to blow up
random recommendation. very nice!
Hey man, saw you on Ed's setup wars. I'm filipino myself, and I wanted to ask what docking station you have. Specifically the one under your desk where you connect your HDMI, ethernet, etc. We have the same kind of laptop but mine is only the ideapad and it doesn't support thunderbolt c Not sure with the LOQ. It needs a separate display link adapter to make a third extra monitor work. Kasi used na rin ang HDMI ko. Sobrang solid ng setup bro! Hoping to get the same feel.
This guy loves Emilia-
hehehe...salamat may napili na rin ako sa mga item mo...
hello sir wow ganda ng home set-up mo sa pc mo...i like the table tsaka kung saan nakalagay yung mga alaga mong laruan
susundan ko ito
Deserve more followers
Maybe Your laptop is Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 not Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 because the left side of the Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 Laptop has absolutely no connection port
i like the best waifus corner
Nice setup, does the xiaomi g pro 27i has give you any kind of problem in daily use due to flickering? Im Planning to buy it and I literallly use the pc al most all day
boss may link ka nung table mo sa kanan? yung pinatungan ng mario and minion? :)
I'm getting goon cave vibes
How did you get the light bar on the monitor? I have the same ones and they just do not fit in
LOQ or LEGION? it can handle 2 tb m.2?
Change the position of your laptop, it doesn't align with the height of the monitor. OCD iykyk!!

price pointyou've got the option to go sitting orstanding because there's a fullyfunctional motorized lift system as wellin our testing we found that the 220 lbsloadbearing capacity was more thanenough for multiple machines includingdesktops and laptops and more than onemonitor being able to stack a goodamount of weight in The Corner gave usextra overhead for testing and workingwhich is greatly appreciated thiscombined with the cable ManagementSolutions makes for a gaming desk that'shard to beat for theprice number two home all gamingdesk when we think of the best budgetgaming desk

Opa Dantic, como vai? Espero que bem. Eu moro no Brasil e meu sonho é trabalhar como desenvolvedor de jogos e aplicativos, porém aqui a coisa está meio complicada na economia, não tenho computador e fui ver para montar um novo, porém irá sair no valor de 6,500. É muito dinheiro, trabalho à noite em escala 6x1 e sinto que isso tem me matado um pouco a cada dia, não tenho conseguido guardar dinheiro pois ajudo minha mãe em casa com as despesas. Gostaria muito se você pudesse realizar esse meu sonho de poder ter um PC novo para desenvolver jogos.

coupleshelves up above where they can put somefigurines or candles or plants or justyou know personalize the space I likethe fact that you've got your monitorlifted up so you've got a bit of spaceunderneath to put like your console andstuff like that you're doing what youcan with the space that you've got but Idefinitely recommend getting a singledisc or a disc where you've got a littlebit more space maybe you could do a dualmonitor setup but hey there's alwaysroom for improvements and this is a goodstarting setup all right Ben tree we'vegot a little bit of a mysterious kind ofvibe going on here the ring light downon the keyboard and mouse is actuallysuper clever because it causes lessstrain on your eyes and you don't needsome big bright lights if you're notstreaming or

The monitor is MSI MAG 271QRX QD-OLED
I switched from an IPS to an OLED about 6 months ago. It's great. The darker blacks really add alot of depth to the picture.
How are u not famous already? Ur content is absolutely amazing
Aint no way bro waterdropped into existence
I got that same monitor, really huge improvement over my previous 1080p 240hz VA one. I wouldn't want to go back to non OLED anytime soon. One of the best improvements to my setup
thanks for the daily content. I always learn something new from your videos! Keep it up!
I snag a deal on an oled during Amazon black Friday and HOLY CRAP I can't got back now. Oled is so good to look at
havent gotten an OLED yet but back in 2018 i went from a 24""1080p 60hz to a 27"" 1440p 144Hz monitor and it was the single best upgrade I've ever done next to going from an HDD to an SSD. Monitor upgrades, especially when there have been generational leaps are massive. Also reminds me when I went from a CRT TV with RCA cables to a 1080p LCD with HDMI on my PS3. Again, one of the most massive jumps in quality I've ever experienced.
Yo Sheed!!!! Love your channel. I'm happy your channel pops up very often
For people wanting a monitor for Gaming specifically, OLED is amazing but if you do any digital work where True Colour matters then IPS is the way to go.
The different way sheed pulls up is always fun to watch
to me, HDR on an oled has been the most impactful visual upgrade I’ve seen since HD TVs in the mid 2000s.
I kinda like the way the IPS looks here over the OLED
The best is when you play in the dark. It's so amazing at first that you will double check your screen is actually turned on or off. It's THAT black. Black as if it was switched off. Sooooo beautiful.
I switched from an lg 34 inch ultra wide 60hz IPS panel to the new lg 32 inch ultragear oled. And i did not like it one bit. I didnt even game on it yet. But the apps just looked washed out and dull. Whites had some kind of a tint to it regardless what preset i chose within monitor. 

When i put it in FPS mode it was decent but still not as accurate as the cheap IPS monitor. It actually hurt my eyes after two hours. Text weren’t as legible either, even at the recommended 150% display setting.
I swapped to an OLED 3 months ago. Not only were the blacks better, but the glossy panel was so much better than a matte display. It makes the image look so sharp and clean.
Your videos are amazing, loved how you used instant transmission like goku
Instant Transmission!? Subscribed.
A little FYI for anyone planning on buying the MSI Oled. The ""Panel Protect"" function is mandatory and can only be delayed by I believe 16 hours. By default it is every 4. If you do not run the pixel panel protect, the monitor will run it for you automatically. It will give you a warning to say ""We're going to run panel protect regardless of whether you press execute now or wait until later.""

It is a little annoying because this can run while you're gaming. So if you're planning on long gaming session, make sure to run panel protect first.
For people with an nvidia card and can’t afford an OLED (at least yet…) can just use the media control panel > display settings then edit the contrast vibrance and everything.

Trust me it makes a huge difference
Bro this is one of the best pc channels ive ever seen. Way to underrated
Found your channel a couple days ago, absolutely loving your content man :) Honestly hadnt thought about a monitor upgrade in a while, but would be a really enjoyable upgrade
I had 2 IPS monitors and recently added an OLED to the mix. If you boost the color on an IPS monitor, it actually makes it looks really good and the colors just pop. It wasn't a life changing event going from IPS to OLED because of that. It's still better, but if you don't want to spend the money, just boost the color
Yeah nah ima need tht back
“ Yeah nah imma need that back”
Oled was a game changer for me. I don't ever want to go back. Lol
And not a word about the annoying flickering when VRR is enabled. OLED can be as good as you want, image flickering when gaming is just an absolute deal breaker.
I got this monitor too and i love how it looks, but i hate the forced oled care soo much. I'm already using the setting where it only reminds me every 16 hours, but the timer doesn't even reset when the monitor is turned off at night and sometimes pops up while im ingame. i hope they fix this since its the only issue for me, i always have to remind myself to manually use oled care first thing when i start up my pc, so it doesnt randomly pop up at the worst moments.
im waiting for QDEL to come out as a cheaper, longer lasting alternative to OLED
Got the same one I love everyday I get to play on it
The best part of IPS to OLED is no back light bleed.
You can go to almost any display store like Best Buy or video only to see the difference.
They said oled has lower durability because of too much burn in and contrast
I have a oled 2k 360hz monitor and the difference from my old main monitor (now my second one) is insane it was an ips 2k 144hz, feeling way smoother and also the real black and colors are INSANE. and yea my monitor costs more than a 4070 x)
SAR 10.00 Donated so God can bless me to upgrade to OLED soon
The Rick and Morty art in the background is so cool, I wanna know where you got that from
I have a QD-OLED TV it's fire af
S90D
the only problem with oled is If you get one when you have multiple monitors.. You will want all of them to be oled because of the color diffrence..
oh and also the price.
Oled also can be brighter, but most cheap oled tend to have low refresh rate for gaming and likely to lack burn in protection.
I'll say this... switching from a TN panel to an IPS one was almost life-changing.
My concern with oled is longevity. I have a monitor from 2014ish, and it look just as good normal as then. It is 1080 but resolutions and response time stay consistent over long periods.
I went from a 24''LCD monitor to a 55'' OLED (LG C1 TV) monitor. It is awesome. Wandering around in RDR2 is so beautiful.
From a good mini LED, not. But from other LCD tech, absolutely worth it.
Maybe my next upgrade. Still gathering infos and opinions.
""shouldn't have to worry too much about burn in""
Yeah.. no thanks.
Just bought my Samsung 49"" OLED Monitor and am planning on buying the 57"" OLED Samsung Monitor next month for a dual wide screen setup. Been on console ny whole life, My PC era will be in full effect before the year is done
I feel like oled monitors are made for people who are already using high end gear in their setup. 
I would not really reccomend an Oled monitor to someone who is running a tight budget.
Get a good deal on an ips monitor and use the extra money to buy one or two more cheap ones for extra screen space.
I use asus tuf va panel and understand that as sometimes i see much concerned on how colors are blured in movement and feels different remember when saw emerlads in mine but in movement colors so mixed that the blurry showed it as dimonds
Oled is far beyond IPS as IPS is far beyond LED. 

-Apocalypse... maybe.
I get those weird vertical lines in certain darker/greyer areas x.x
Don't let youreself be fooled into spending money like that, IPS at 1440 is very good. Sure, Oled panels are great but it is not worth the price.
Ty!
I have Samsung Odyssey G8 oled and that's an amazing monitor
You can make ips like oled with screen dim and if you save money on oled you can get higher resolution or hz
I'm gonna upgrade to an OLED later this year, Hopefully by that point prices will go down a bit more.
I went with IPS just today as I needed neww monitor, the old one was VA so I AM getting a lot more performance and OLED is just still crazy expensive where I live. Maybe in five years.
I hate the panel protect. I was in a ranked game and had to do the refresh and couldn’t cancel. First it was every 4 hours, now I have it on 16 hours. The screen is nice, but I wouldn’t buy it again
Insane price difference is never worth it.
You can go to a building called a ""shop"" where they have things like this on display so you can see them...
Instant transmission was dope
Two years on my Alienware Aw34dwf and still happy
My friend just got a brand new PC and he use to use a 60hz monitor for his console gaming. Now he just got a MSI OLED monitor and he notices a HUGE DIFFERENCE in response time, color, and smoothness. He really loves it
My oled monitor just arrived today I got the aw2725 and I was using a g2724d up until today I had never seen an oled monitor in real life only images and holy shit. It is beautiful
I game on a pair of 40 inch 1080p60 tvs i got from FB Marketplace for 50 dollars each... I had 3, but the third one finally died after being on almost 24/7 for like 6 years straight...
Went from a 34inch va to a 34inch qd oled, no regrets.
The main and only game that runs absolutly superb and looks astounding is horizon games on my c3 especially if u do the personalized setup and prefer sharpness gosh it's so good I almost always take screenshots mid play everytime
34”UW OLED 175hz was my best upgrade in last 10 years.
My steam deck oled fd me up it’s so beautiful it’s hard to play on my tv anymore
Which IPS monitor do you use?
I was gonna get that same exact model but I went with an LG OLED monitor since it was more of a discount at the time
Its cool for sure but there are other panel types that look good too. Once you use an OLED for a month the wow factor is gone. I personally think maximizing pixel density provides the most immersive experience
48 inch LG CX OLED, 5 years old and amazing
gonna wait fr micro led monitors to b a thing
it may be better visually but dang if its not expensive. it is definitely not the norm yet and maybe in the future it can be more reachable for me. heres hoping
returned back to amazon MSI MAG 271QRX QD-OLED becouse of text fringing :))))) purple colors on the corners os apps and games.. becouse of qd oled pixels layout
well the first time that i switch to the OLED panel was like switching from a ps2 to a ps4pro and now i cant go back to the ips panels at all
I just bought my first oled after seeing one for the first time in Best Buy.
Nice Short! In the same boat, on a 1080p monitor for far too long. Wide 1440p is where I'm headed
I got an oled a few months ago. A few days ago it broke so I brought out my old one. The difference is massive.
I love the style of your presentations
If you're going to make content like this to inform people, you need to cover all aspects of what you're talking about. 

OLED looks great, but whether you should get one or not ENTIRELY depends on if you play games that leave HUD elements on your screen for long periods of time. Burn in is a real thing and I don't see you talking about it at all. Important consideration if you play MMO's

Besides, you can make your LCD monitor look better just inside of the Nvidia control panel itself. Go to Adjust desktop color settings > and set the brightness down to 50% , set contrast to 60% , and set the Digital Vibrance to 60%

You can make your colors pop more like an OLED screen without any danger of burn in. I'll wait for prices on Micro-LED to come down
I upgraded from a 34 inch (3440x1440p) IPS for my Desktop to a 16 inch (2560x1600p) OLED on my laptop and despite the size difference, the OLED is by far my favorite
Depending on model and brand OLED's are very nice to have, especially if you play a lot of triple A titles. I've been play Last of Us Part 2 on my OLED, and it looks unbelievable
I recently got the AOC Pro 45inch curved OLED Monitor and its awesome ,really makes the graphics pop out ....
I use a OLED C2 tv for gaming, avowed looks amazing on it with ray tracing
I have the LG 27"" 1440p OLED and it is too dim for me. I went back to my IPS.
I’ve owned many Oled’s over the years, the picture quality are indeed stunning! Perfect deep blacks with vibrant colours. But no matter how hard you to try to avoid it, you’ll eventually get burn in that ruins your screen completely. You can try lowering the brightness, even try using features like pixel shift. But it will just delay the inevitable. Until manufacturers figure out how to completely eliminate this issue, avoid Oled’s.
I never had a fancy monitor, i only ever had some cheap small tv that is lower than 1080p. The best screen besides a tv ive seen was a laptop screen, which looked pretty good. It was an oled, but im guessing a lower end one. I am yet to see above 70hz refresh rate, but once i can, i will be getting a good pc or laptop with a good screen
yo make a part 2 talking about refresh rates, because it doesnt matter what fps your rig can put out when the refresh rate for your monitor will always cap it to 60 fps
real talk though, if you dont have the budget for it, some regular 1440 monitors are just fine, but you will not regret getting OLED for sure.
Love your type of humor lmao
Oled variant will be 2-3x the price of an IPS monitor with the same parameters. Without a side by side comparison you won't see the difference in a home setting. If you play a lot of the same game with the same elements on screen, they will burn in eventually. If you can afford it, go with the Oled, if you're gaming on a budget then go with a quality vibrant IPS display. Most popular games these days are vibrant and colorful.
Recently switched to a HDR oled monitor, so worth it. Better investment than a new gpu.
I upgraded to 4K OLED on Sunday from a 1440p Gaming Monitor. It is a world of difference. Just absolutely tasty.
I had a legion 5 pro. I just got a Asus g16 OLED. Mannnnn it’s a night and day difference when gaming. Even just the start up when it only shows Asus logo that shit looks clean asf. If you have the money I’d always say upgrade to OLED
I got a steam deck OLED because so many gaming dads praise it saying you can game anywhere with oled 90hz screen
 Guess what after many months, I still game way more on my desktop pc with ips 1440p monitor. One important reason is that the steam deck Oled cannot offer high refresh rate gaming while my 1440p 170hz monitor and rtx 4070 gpu can.
I wonder what the only disadvantage of Oled can be ?
I spend a lot of time on productivity... I'm really scared of OLED burn-in.
I’m on an OLED and I thought the right monitor was the OLED and looked better than the right. Even after you clarified, I still thought the right one looked as good or better.
you forgot the NITS bro

transform this currentempty room into the ultimate jeel gamingroom because about a month ago mygirlfriend and I moved house and sincethen this has pretty much been ourgaming setup it's not the best so overthe next 5 days I'm going to completelytransform this room into the ultimateJewel gaming setup complete withincredibly powerful PCS some of the mostHightech gaming accessories and ofcourse incredibly cool lighting designsthis is going to be the best gaming roomI've ever built on this channel and mymost expensive but there's anotherreason as to why I'm building it so thisis my beautiful fianceé Emily werecently just moved house and in 5 daysit's Emily'sbirthday so I thought it would be areally cool idea is if in those 5 days Imake literally the craziest dual gamingsetup for your birthday and then on yourbirthday we just spend all day playinggames there that sounds that would beamazing inredible that would be amazinghowever you aren't allowed to go in theroom so you've got to disappear so Ihave got my friend Adam here to help meout with the room cuz it this is goingto be a ginormous build probably thebiggest gaming set of build I have everdone so let's go do it let's go get itdone in fact we need to go to IKEA firstlet's do that first let's do that firstnow we're heading to Ikea because mostof the products in my initial design forthis room are all Ika products so wesearched around the entire store to findeverything that we needed we needlike good few of these pair them with afew of these Alex drawerswe'll get a Mega Death and although wedid find everything that we were lookingfor one of these one of these I actuallyfound a few things I didn't even plan tobuy but I knew I had to have if thissetup was going to be the best one I'veever built I could lit do this all daybut once we found everything we werefaced with our very first problem oh myGod oh my God there's a lot of stuffhere yeah there is too there's a lot isthis going to fit this is really longit's like really long I don't this mylong now because I have a small car it'snot really designed to carry a lot ofIkea furniture have you seen my seathave you seen where I'm going to have tosit yeah you're going to you're going tohave to sit in there it was funny fromthis camera you can't even see you intheback now as we make our way back home Iwant to tell you the plan of how we'regoing to make this room possible firstof all we need to fill the room withFurniture oh my God he's turning he'sturninghe's then we need to add some crazylighting oh God there's police Adamthere's place no oh and then finally weneed to add a jeal gaming setup oh myGod that was so stressful now we justhad to bring everythingin this is all the stuff that we've gotfor the room to build today this is themost Ikea furniture I've ever boughtwhere do you even start what I thinkthis will be easy bang it out a coupleof hours Red Bull come on oh my godlet's start with the drawers[Music]instructions oh Adam it's happened againevery time I'm here every single timethe instructions always go out thebloody window anyways enough messingabout let's put these deskstogether push that over here this deskis going to behuge oh this is going to look sick thatis Mega desk bro you could get like aracing Sim in here I don't know if youcould I reckon you could okay all thedesks have been put together we've gotthis huge l-shape my setup's going to gohere Emily's setup's going to go hereand sort of over here it looks reallycool however we're not finished on dayone just yet we have still got to buildthe chairs so let's go get them Adam nowluckily for us see who had kindly sentout two of their finest chairs to put inthis setup wao special gloves let's getthese out this one lookswhite oh that isnice they smell good the chairs did infact smell good and you know what theywere easy to put together as well we didthem in about 15 minutes but none ofthat really matters if they're notcomfortable to sit on okay me and Adamhave both built our chairs Let's testout if we're going to use them let'sgo o now this is all right this is all ylook at this this is actually all rightohW oh this is good oh man I can fallasleep right here now I actually mightnow the main chair that see who sent uswas the Doro C300 Pro and I can't liethis chair looks incredible it has alumbar tracking system which providesreal time support that wraps around yourlower back it's got three differentangles for you to recline at 6Dcoordinated armrest I mean look at themthey go up down left right forward backin out there's even a tilt function thisis one of the most versatile chairs I'veever sat in and I want to thank see whofor sending it out as well as their M5 7chair which has a really nice provablemess design and also has duel andarsupport with 3D coordinated armreststhese chairs are going to lookabsolutely incredible in this setup andif you want to check any of them outI'll leave a link in the descriptionlike I said this is going to be the mostexpensive setup I've ever made so thankssee who for sponsoring this video ofmaking this happen now to round off thefirst day I added some extra support tothe mega desk and I also stuck up these3D art panels however this literallytook me all night it was really worth itthough as I feel like they give the rooma bit of depth and even though the roomstarted to actually look good it didn'tstop me from attempting to put up ashelf before I went to bed okay um it is1: in the morning I don't know if youcan tell in my voicebut I'm really tired so I'm going tosleep and carry on in themorning now on the start of day two meand Adam started to build another deskbecause believe it or not this roomisn't going to just have two setups it'sgoing to have three I'll explain lateranyways it was time to add the rest ofthe shelves look at that like a gloveright now I'm actually combining twodifferent types of Ikea shelves to getlike this really thick shelving designis that what you would call it like alike a thick shelf I don't know I had tocut some of the shelves to make them fitbut once we had done that all thefurniture was completed which means wecould move on tolighting however not all of the stuffthat I've ordered has arrived yethowever we've still got quite a few toputup yeah we're going to fill this roomwith pretty much the craziest lightingI've ever put in any room so let's putthem[Music]in this is literally just the first oneI reckon it will look even better when Iturn theseoffoh my this is one light one light I'vegot like 10 to 15 more this is going tolook good anyways the next light to addwas this crazy desk light that I couldput all the way around the deskoh my God we've only put two lights onright now I I could stop here and itwould still look incredible this isgoing to be the best setup I've evermade I can just tell but if I actuallywant to make this the best room thatI've ever made I need to get rid of oneof the worst things about thisroom the biglight you see if I just turn off everysingle light in here and I put on thelightswitch do you see what I mean it just itjust looks horrible I genuinely thinkthis might be one of the worst thingsmankind has ever invented I mean there'sthere is a few other things obviouslybut um top three at least so one I'vegot here is a Phillips hue light switchwhich is basically the exact same thingbut it's a uh a color changing bulb so Ijust get rid of thisone I should beable to change it to different colors Ibought this ginormous lamp from Ikearight when you put on it oh waa it umyeah it doesthat oh my God just like that the roomwas completely transformed with just afew lights it's honestly giving mespaceship sort of Vibes right now but Istill want to make this room better umI'm whispering because I want to stayquiet so Emily can't hear me butrealistically um I need to make thisroom look as good as possible cuz umgenuinely this Channel's success wouldnot have happened without her like someof you may know thatI've wanted to do YouTube since I was 11years old because of Emily I am nowdoing that she's generally made mydreams come true so I just want to beable to surprise her with this likecrazy room um for her birthday I need Ineed it to be good so I'm going to workthrough the night I'm going to put upsome more lights and yeah overall I feellike we've made some very good progressfor day[Music]two hello my friends it is day three andI have currently spent around about 90%of today just waiting around for Amazon[Music]packagescheers thank you very much forthat oh my God there is so many packageslet's take these upstairs because theAmazon delivery was so late it now meansthat we've got even less time to finishthis sowe really need to getstarted more lightssoundproofing next light is in O itgenuinely just keepsgetting it just keeps getting better andbetter now there was only one more Setof Lights to put up however I might havemade a slight miscalculationI I don't have enough I'm currentlybuying some and they will arrivetomorrow it just means that I'm I'mreally cutting it close so since we'reputting Lighting on hold right now weneed to move on with some other thingsnow this room currently has a problemwhen youclap there there's a bit of an echo so Ineed to reduce that by putting up theseuh foam acoustic panels so I stuck themonto the wall and not only did it givethe wall a nice design the echo was alsomassively reduced but now let's add the[Music]monitors we have got the monitor arms onwhich now means we've got to add somemonitors to them and uh let's just say Imight have gone a little bit Overkillbecause not only do we have one monitorI didn't just get two I didn't get justthree I didn't get just four I didn'tget just five I have got us six monitorsthat is three monitors each and a a lotofelectricity rip my bank account now forpeople who love Tech the top twomonitors here are 4K 27 in monitors 144Herz and all the rest are just normal27in 1080p monitors that are going to beused for other things so let's get theseopen that is nice[Music]nice and that is the six monitor this isreally starting to come along now on areal one though it isapproaching midnight uh I know I wassuper hyped to put these monitors up butnow I just know I havegot a lot to clean up likejust look at all this rubbish man I wantto go to bed butI'm going to keep doing this forly I'mgoing to just now tidy this entire placeoffand I'll see you guys in the[Music]morning good morning everyone it is dayfour and um let's just say right now Iam getting a little bit conscious oftime becauseum not everything has all right I wastaking a walk with Emily earlier and Iasked her what is the one thing thatshe's kind of really expecting from thiswhole setup and she said as long as Iget a PC considering you gave my lastone away to a subscriber it's finelisten I'll get you a new pc it'll bethe best PC you've everseen they haven't arrived yet andEmily's birthday is in 2 days however umsome other stuff did arrive today whichis the Nano Leaf lights and some moremonitor arms so at least we've gotsomething to work on today so I startedadding the extra monitor arms and justas i f I was making someprogress okay we have a slight problemum I've realized there's not there's nota lot of like leg room here I can onlyjust barely fit in this place theproblem is I've used Too Many Alexdrawers and I've got to get rid of onewithout the entire setup collapsing ohthat nearly messed everything up I'mpretty much playing the setup equivalentof Jenga I don't like this apart from ifI mess up here Emily is not going tohave any monitors you guys have no ideahow tricky this is in the end though Imanaged it the next thing on my to-dolist is to fix the Nano Leafpanels okay the lights now should be alldone so let's plug themin yo oh myGod this this generally might be thebest setup I have honestly ever made Iam so happy right now we've only justnow completed the lighting stage so ifthat crossed off the the list we'reactually on track to finishing thisbefore Emily's birthday let me justconfigure these and we can finally TurnAll the Lights On but it's when Istarted configuring them that we hadanother problem okay we havea a serious serious problem trying toget the Nano Leaf lights to sink up tomy phone they just won't work the oneson the right here just seem to be faultyas I spent the past 3 hours trying toset them up but they just wouldn't workI even went into my garage to see ifthere was any on Leaf lights but I foundnothing basically now midnight Iliterally spentlike 7 hours trying to get them all toconnect and link up and it just won'twork I've done it hundreds of timesbefore I've been on literally everyReddit post I've been on every onlineform just trying to figure out I'm justgoing to have to um sort lighting out onthe final day then I[Music]guess it is the last day before Emily'sbirthday so I've got basically all oftoday to try and finish off this room Idon't really know if everything's goingto arrive today but judging by the waythings are going I might have to try andextend the deadline to like later in theday on her birthday but yeah we we'vegot to get started now today is the daywhere we add in basically all of thegaming setup accessories I've got somany things to add in here first thingwe're putting in is these white speakersthat match perfectly with the setup andthen we've also got these matchingWireless Logitech headphones this isprobably the most expensive setup I'vemade because everything that I have tobuy I have to buy two of them we've evengot some Led headset stands so thatthese headsets have a place to sit we'veeven got a white microphone arm to gowith a brand new sha mv7 whitemicrophone now we're not really usingthis for gaming it's going to be morefor voiceovers like the one you'rehearing now in fact this is the exactmicrophone that I'm currently speakinginto and you can probably tell I sound alot better anyway now it's time forkeyboards now for me I've gone with thislike I don't even know what it's calledH I75 I don't even know I saw itand itjust oh and it's white and blue so Ithought it would be perfect for Emily'skeyboard we're going with this pink epermaker one which I put in her last setupbut it's it's that good we've got to putit in this one and for the mouse we'regoing with the best mouse in the worldthe MX Master 3s again though I've hadto get two of these which is um uh thisvideo has been so expensive I tookanother shot of trying to fix thelighting on the wall but then I had anunexpected guest[Music]arrive oh look who decided to turn up ohM oh I missed it I missed a little bitof this haven't I just a bit yeah comeand help me out man what's your what'syour first impressions thisis so clean now remember when I saidearlier that I was building a thirdsetup we still need to add things intothat as it's currentlywell it hasn't got anything in it sowe've actually got a Mini PC that'sgoing in here nice little Keyon keyboardhypx mouse speakers and you know how Ialso said earlier that I'd got sixmonitors that was a a lie again I gotseven so that that's the seventh monitornow oh God this setup is purely going tobe used for dumping Youtube footage ontoand it's also going to be a spare setupif anyone else wants to game with us butanyways forget about that Emily's new PChas just arrived this is Emily's PC butwe actually do have another one of thesecoming the problem is I ordered thesePCS on separate dates so we do haveanother one of these coming you're justgoing to have to imagine right now thatthere is another one right here becausethere is one coming now these PCS aretough of the line I went all out on thespecs of these mainly because I did giveEmily's last PC away to a subscriber butthis thing is is better than anythingshe's ever had before these are thespecs literally it's top of the line itit cost around about three grand andwe've got two of them anyways added somefinal touches like Emily's iPad andmicrophone and I even got us some customXbox Pro controllers these things areabsolutely insane we've never played onPro controllers before but just holdingthis thing in my hands I know 100% it'sgoing to enhance our gaming experienceand of course I've got myself a matchingone for myself and as we added them itbecame midnight it literally just becameEmily's birthday anduh she's just sat there editing Emily'sactually working on a video right nowwhich we want to make when we hit 500ksubscribers which will be to open thefirst ever free gaming store for a daywe really want to make this video so hitsubscribe if you want to see that happenanyways it's time for the final[Music]day

Feel like I've been on the adventure with you the whole time, and the whole story with your fiance makes me feel the emotion you felt while making this room. 

I've been there so many times where everything goes so smoothly, until something goes wrong and then you're 8 hours deep with still no idea how to fix it, but good on you for persevering as the lighting looks amazing, especially that pendant! Sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to reveal the problem. I'm doing the same office renovation and it's just so tiring sometimes, up till 1am either painting or moving stuff around, so I can definitely empathise with the struggles and the toll it takes on you.

You certainly deserve way more subs, and I hope you make more of these videos in the future!
Glad to see that whilst being so kind to all these people he still treats himself and his girlfriend. Keep it up Dantic I'm loving the vids!
I remember from a previous vid that she liked the white better with only touches of pink and love that it got remembered (as an icon like Dan would lol). Happy late Birthday Emily!!
Hey Dantic!
Huge fan here I'm 27 and have always been passionate about gaming. Your content really speaks to people like me who dream big but are limited by what we have. Right now, I'm stuck using a GTX 2060, only 4GB RAM, a 500GB HDD, and a 650W PSU. It barely holds up for gaming, let alone learning video editing or streaming.

One of my biggest dreams is to start a YouTube channel — something where I can finally share my love for gaming and creativity. But the setup just isn’t there, and financially, upgrading hasn’t been possible for me.

If there’s ever a time you’re helping someone level up their setup, I’d be honored to be considered. Just having someone like you even read this means a lot. Your videos don’t just entertain — they motivate people like me to keep dreaming.

Much love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Keep doing what you do, you’re genuinely making a difference
CA$2.00 Like the last vid, I didn't watch it yet, but ik it's gonna be fire Just got through the first minute, Happy birthday Emily!
Just came across this guy for the first time, subscribed after 2 videos. Cutest gaming/YouTube couple, amazing editing that it's like being on the journey in person. Time to binge watch everything this guy has uploaded.
I just recently started watching you in 2024 watching you strive for the creative artistic way gaming can come in different shapes and sizes. I love that you're bringing the inner childhood of everyone around you out with the amazing designs in gaming rooms you create with you and your teams. I hope for you to never let that fire burn in your heart bro
I just got my first pc today and your the first person to pop up on my YouTube for a pc setup and your channel is awesome definitely going to be subscribing
Santa did a low key version of this for my kiddos this year. You had to be so excited when completed. So rewarding. Keep up the fun sir
New subscriber here from the Philippines! 🇵🇭 Rooting for both of your success. I've been watching your vids for two straight days—love it!
You make the coolest gaming setups, every setup looks amazing, cool video
Day 1 of asking Dantic to make me a gaming setup
Now this is some fire dedication to your girlfriend.... it's beautiful that you spent so much money just to make her happy..,And it's beautiful that she shows appreciates your by thanking you, it shows how much you both love each other.... Personally, this was a very good vid
You guys are so loving, happy birthday Emily.
Yes…we are really doing this 18:27
This is the definition of a proper YouTube video
08:46 awwwwww
Amazing video brother. You genuinely cooked with the setup
Crazy how in 4 months you’ve crushed your 500k sub goal?!
what an insane gaming setup / room bro!! 

Keep up the insane work!
Awmygod, that cable management is power! Let’s go overseas and see if omen will sponsor a road trip to do a amazing setup for a fan. Let’s try to get 3 likes to kickstart this crazy idea
Loved helping with this one. I think we did a pretty good job!
The thought that he would actually go through all this and put up all this money just for a hug from the bottom of his sister's heart, it really brings tears to my eyes, he's just fighting to have the best relationship with his siblings, God bless my friend
Hi Dantic! I was here wen you hit 100k and now i cant believe how fast your channel is growing! I wish you and you fiance the best of luck for the future!
How does this guy always find a way to give him self a way harder challenge in every video .It’s always like a super short deadline or something
i did watch the entire thing.. no lies.. i did watch it when it came out 50 mins ago but then DINNER TIME.. GREAT VIDEO!!!
your like the only youtuber i watch without clickbait thumbnails
MX$20.00 Te quedo super bro🫠
i love it! i recommend working on cable management on future setups as it improves the aesthetics so much!
0:10 ""Its not the best"" Yeah bro its an empty room ️
I wish I had someone like her, she's really my dream girl, but Emily seems nice too, congrats to you both
WHY NO CABLE MANAGEMENT????????????????????
You know it’s a good day when Dantic posts.

well done for 1 million
This setup is so insane, what a satisfying video

Hey Dantic,

I know this is a lot to ask, and I don’t even know if you’ll see this, but I just wanted to try... My Ps4 is really old, and I can barely run anything on it. I watch your videos every day, and they always make me smile, even when things are tough. I’ve always dreamed of having a setup like yours, but things at home have been rough, and I can’t afford a new one.

I don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful—I just admire you so much, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you’d see this and understand how much it would mean to me. Even if you can’t help, thank you for everything you do. Your videos make my days a little easier.
Another banger I love the videos
11:50 Why do you have in your phone a Monday??
Petition for Dantic to start a gaming channel.
bro the youtube ai says the topic is no cable management
2:42 Max lével complete! Now is time to build!
Hello from Denmark. Just wanted to drop by and say that me and my son are huge fans. We love your videos, and your gaming setups. Currently trying to make my sons gaming room Cool, but doesnt seem to live up to the ones you make keep up the good work. You inspire us
it said monday on the phone even though you said it was tuesday 11:40
GROW A GARDEN MUSIC 5:47
0:55 TODAY I REPLACE MY FIANCE FOR 6 DAYS
What I find funny is my birthday jabbed itself between their birthdays 
Emily: 23rd
Me: 27th
Dan: 30th

admiro la paciencia que tienen para crear y armar las cosas !
Emily and Adam's Turkish voice-over could have been better. Other than that, the video is great. Nice to meet you, my friend.

Dan:”its not the best”
Me:”it’s non existent?”
Please provide Indonesian translation, many of us Indonesian people enjoy watching your videos, so please provide more Indonesian translation in the next video. Thank you, my friend!

yung suot mo boss sapat na
My dream wathces right now are RMs .
Bro didn't flex about how value the watch are but the life that wasn't trapped by capitalism's work cycle clock
Bros flexing
Yeah you lost this one
Good roast a rolex
i didnt notice the rolex till i was already half way through the video lmao
Seiko box and Rolex...
Bro wearing a rolex
What I found is 


This guy pays for posting certain comments , and makes video to show off
first off that's not a Rolex
Is it for 13k$
Roly not fair
Rolex
That shit bro is wearing is really cheap..
Flexing rolex
Get casio royale 
Cheap looking good 
Keep the time
Bro haven't got any car for sure
Rolex submariner in one hand hahaha
Yes and I am blind
Yo you don't have cars
That Rolex flex
Do you have a Rolex on your hand
Such a rich gamer but only one rolex watch
The submariner is shining on us bruh
It's fake every buddy is fucking stupid
Showing off his damn Rolex…
I respect that man
Bro you forgot to introduce the diver Seiko thing on your wrist
Casually wears rolex
You don't have a boss????
What happened to your wife??
what a humble guy, i dont see any luxury watch.
just rolex not Patek :P
This man is crazy rich :)
Do you make money through YouTube or something else
It took me a while to realize he was wearing a Rolex sea master
Yes you don't have Any Rolex I will
You forget the fake Rolex bro
What abt car collection?
Sometimes I feel the vloggers they themself comment through proxy channels and create a content out of it
Is that a submariner?
Gagow
What about a car collection?
Bro was just showing off his rolex all this time
Dino ain't flexing now... he's cooked us in every way possible
Lol Rolex
Rolex oyster
You don't have a shareing mentality because you are a introvert gamer
Flexing rolex submariner
yeah yeah it seems you have it all....but do you have a porn collection
Always flexing like a stupid child. 
Grow up man. 
First you pick the comment and the try to show off 
Stupid
What about your Rolex

Btw nice rolex...
Bro. Dont mind them.
Nah bros flexing the submariner
Causual rolex
His flexing game IS strong
I also have that Rolex Submariner
kinda dissapointed i thought you will wear different watch every time u showed a cheap one
Rolex black submariner shining! man! what a flex! haha
To be very honest, owning a couple of Rolexes is very very very very common in Asia.
Bro literally just had his own Rolex which can be around more than $50k
Because your broke
Bro have a Rolex and a sieko watch box .......
But never show off
I like pokemon watch .
Let's just forget about the Rolex that he is wearing
entire time flexing rolex
Bro has Rolex submariner
How to flex Rolex ...be humble....
you are this rich but i bet you dont have bracelet collection
And he is wearing a ROLEX while showing his collection nic3 brooo
But you dont have a camera collection and an antique radio collection
you guys have watch collections? damn I need to make some money quick
You're Kapampangan (based on your accent and the flexing).
“I don’t work” is a bigger flex than that Rolex
“Tell me you own Submariner without telling me you own a Submariner!” ️

really liked my last desk tour butso much has changed between then and nowso I wanted to give you guys an updateddesk tour so without further Ado let'sget right into it so one of the mostcommon questions I'm asked is is whatdesk do you have and the answer to thatis this is actually two desks so Ireceived this first desk here on theleft from the Tik Tok shop as a freesample it is a height adjustable deskbut I currently have that feature offbecause I actually have this desk pushedup next to another desk that I'm goingto show you here in a second this deskis um from Ikea I will go ahead

leather chair with little kittyears on top it's pretty good for theprice it was less than $200 and it has acute little footrest I'm not mad at itone new thing that I added to my desksetup that I didn't have previously arethese 3D wall panels and if you want tosee how I put them on go ahead and watchmy dusk makeover video I have twoshelves from Ikea these are the lackshelves and then on top of them I justhave some cute little knickknacks that Iwanted to display that I thought wouldlook cute but tell me why are thesethings hanging on for dear life likethis now let's talk about the tech andthe peripherals that make my desk set upfunctional and funso for audio I have my deom speakers Ilove these because they have pretty goodsound quality they're aesthetic and theyjust double it as really cute Decorwhile also beingfunctional moving on I have the yanzix75 mechanical keyboard this thing'spretty solid it's done me good for atleast 2 years and then I recently justgot this Logitech mouse that I have beenreally loving lately as well forstreaming I have been using the Sony zv1and I just have it connected to aregular tripod I have mine connected toa demi battery because the battery lifeon this thing is absolutely atrociousbut it gets the jobdone one of my favorite additions that Iadded recently is this CD player it issuch a cute little thing I have beenloving just popping in a CD while I'mworking or gaming it just adds a wholedifferent vibe to my setup oh andspeaking of gaming I keep my controllersat my desk too for easy access havingthem right here just makes things moreconvenient these are the ones I have andthis is my microphone guys this is whatI'm currently filming my voice over withI think it's a pretty dang goodmicrophone now on to the core of mysetup my

ahead and leave alist in the description for you guys butanyways as someone who spends so muchtime at my desk I really wanted todecorate my space with things thatreflect my personality and made me happyso I added this Ikea pegboard to thewall and I filled it with a lot oflittle trinkets like keychains minifigures photos and some ambient lightingand I really like how it turned out Ithink it's a really great way toShowcase yourpersonality and finally I have differentlight sources throughout my setup thatmake my desk feel just a little bit morecozy from my monitor light bar to mydeom displays

Hello, I have multiple medical services centers with a company called Mainstreet and multiple boutique therapy product shops where data must be managed accurately and efficiency.

Would you be interested in a job position in corporate office compliance and hospitality? You would get paid to set these types of systems up with the design elements intact.

His computer is maxed out 
His monitor is maxed out 
His credit card is maxed out
CARTERPCS ACTUALLY MAKING A VIDEO ON PCS??? IMPOSSIBLE!
That view though
""It has erectile disfunction"" me too dude, me too...
cant wait for 6090 to come out eventually
carter is living up to his channel name finally
How dare YouTube hide this from me for 11 seconds
that view is great, imagine it starts raining when youre gaming... Damn
such a sick setup with the view out the window <3
singleplayer story games are accctually really nice on the large one
can you max out the thug shake stat pls
“It’s too big”
proceeds to just add another monitor
Monitor's been sitting in that closet like Springtrap in the hidden room
We need rainbolt to find your location from this video
Sometimes I wonder how you made it to 19 years old without dying
His setup is absolutely insane. Goals.
Bro got 10,000 FPS
Thats actually a pretty nice location as well to game on. When you want to get your mind of the game for a bit just checking out the view is nice.
Accidently Slips on his Gaming Setup, Falls down 14 Floors
Omg that lg ultragear oled 45 inch monitor looks amazing.
The wonky hat says it all lol
putting the big monitor on top is genuinely insane
That view is so good
that monitor is MASSIVE!!
How is that monitor too big to game on? I literally have a 45 inch ultrawide monitor and it is amazing
The question is… who is the camera man
Wish I had these problems :]
Bro finally hired a cameraman
the one dude on youtube with a 5090 who actually deserves it
Bro looking the shattered soldier at the end is so subtlety funny
Your so rich and so humble wowwwwwwww so humble wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwowowowowow
Carterpcs actually making a video about pcs
Can you do another video on the AI situation with deepseek?
His setup is ridiculously awesome. Major goals.
Great match congrats
""its got erectile disfuntion"" got me on the floor
The view is insane, its amazing that you can see the whole city while gaming
Bro's taking in clash of clans terms xD
Downscale a 1440p crt, you can get like 120+ hz in 1080p and 60 in 1440
If the 24"" 480hz monitor is at 1080p,it could be great for Esports titles or possibly any other game at max settings without the need of DLSS, especially for such resolution.
Who’s the camera man
Clean setup especially with the nice view. It must look even better at night.
can i have the old one i have a all in 1 dell computer and i get 60 to 70 fps in valorant
I just play on a 42” 4k/120 Sony tv. But I also don’t really play competitive pc games
Please Carter pcs I’m still asking for your old pc
Bro is in another universe
that acully good
That monitor is just chilling is his closet
Rare footage of caterspcs actually talking about PCs
What is that monitor stand it is so good
Bro that monitor is MASSIVE…
CHAT HES MAKING A VIDEO ABOUT PC'S AND NOT RIDING APPLES DIH
Pls can haz old setup?
the posture will be amazing
Putting the monitor on upside down is the most Carter thing ever. Nathans power bank is still haunting you Carter, beware. ️
bro just has a 480 hz monitor in his closet
I’m still waiting for my pc Carter
If its an oled monitor its already good enough
""It has erectile dysfunction"" was so random
thats kinda overkill
bro casually has a 27"" 480Hz monitor in his closet
We need the ultra wide…
“they finally look good” that’s chaotic neutral at best
Companies think this is what the average consumer looks like.
Bro just had this monitor in his closet
We have a new RTX Gpu before GTA 6
Bro casually has a 480 hertz monitor in his closet
How do you game behind an open video? Cant even imagine how uncomfortable it would be to look at get some curtains how hard is it
Dude I put my 45” upside down too! Was a pain installing solo on a 0-gravity. It’s all good now
Heard you get an fps boost if you do the thug shake
Now get a wooting 80he
bro ur young to be a tech king good on you bro
Fun fact for the Allen wrench, you can use your thumb on the short arm for a faster screw.
Day 5 of asking Carter for a pc
But cater can it run a video of you doing the tug shaker
Can it run doom?
so we aint getting carter doing the thug shake, now lets get monitor 1 and 2 doing the thug shake!!!
Collab with BennyBennion1
Plug it in while on for better performance
Bro got the batman cave setup
YEAH THE CORVETTE SWEATSHIRT
all this just for him to grind minecraft
Even though his gaming table like ‘meh’ like me, still his room with very nice scenery and pc gaming like
the setups lovely 
time to play 2ds and 3ds games on it
Carter doing work
i cant even think how any1 would game on smt smaller than 27 inches , 27 and 32 are the sweet spots imo
it actually looks sick
that view is all we need
Him leaning over to place the monitor down that close to those big as s windows that high up kinda scared me
Honestly surprised he’s using 1440p rather than 4K. Not that 1440p is bad or anything, it’s just that if he puts together a “maxed out” PC like he says, he could definitely run games at 4K and I feel like he wouldn’t be fully utilizing the power of his build
What are you playing on the first part
Oh ye back with another good vid
The parking outside is crazy
Well I say a 15k$ graphics card you got that hmmm
480hz on competitive games with DLSS4 
LATENCY WILL BE INSANE
What’s the resolution
where can I get one?
Finally a real monitor
But can it run minesweeper?
I subscribed
w
Man Carter just flexing now
Wrestling with the monitors is crazy
An hour and not 2 years I could cry
What is the curved monitor name?
The bezels
Why monitor arms are you using?!
cant wait for 100090 RTX deluxe premium
Getting ready for GTA six
So basically we been watching the prologue/prelude of CarterPCs and we finally got to the part where the plot twist happens
Combine 2 pcs
“it’s got erectile dysfunction” i was not expecting that from carter lol tf
RIP the table
Rare footage of lil bro’s actual PC content
im still waiting to get cash to build something glorious like this
Bro your view is amazing
Omg hi
His computer is maxed out  
His monitor is maxed out 
His credit card is maxed out 
his beard is maxed out
Just wait until his electrical bill comes in
Dude tighten the spring tension in that top one they have a screw to change that so it doesn't fall down I can tell it's resting on that other display
The monitor set up dawg
Carter please review the Samsung 3-D monitor
The way everyone supports each other here is insane! I feel like we’re all playing together in real time
WHEN DID CARTER GROW A BEARD GODDAMN
master Oogway- ""the only ting you need to max out now is yourself""
bro casually has a 480hz monitor in his closet and im still stuck on a 60hz office monitor
Not the Apple Vision Pro sitting in the closet forgotten lmao
bros sagging
i would use the big boy for gaming
If I would have this kind of view I would play without monitor
CARTER I EXPECTED MORE FROM U, WHERE TF IS THE 4K, 240HZ, 0.03 MS MONITOR AT?????
Cater has 26in
bros throwing away a 1440p monitor while i can't even afford a ps5
Haha I thought I was the only one going crazy but everyone else was in the same boat talking strategies and tips for every over
Bro just pulled out beast out of his closet
how u got a 5090??/
Wait for that 4k 540 hz monitor to release
Hi
“Maxed out gaming pc” bro talks like it’s a video game
The tournaments are great because you are competing against people worldwide Adds to the thrill
this might be the best monitor setup oat
Bro is rich
you need the monitor from ""the kids in the back"" meme
""its got erectile disfunction dude"" is my new favourite clip
Early 













CARTER THUG SHAKEEEEE
Bro is not escaping the rich kid allegations
He found the infinite money glitch
holy shit he made a pc related video
It looks like a 3DS without the buttons, joystick, and the internal components. Oh and 100x larger.
bro has a crazy monitor chilling on a blanket in his closet
Bro decided to go with the t-flip orientation.
Who's recording Carter...
Now put Teo of the long ones on the sides of it
I NEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mans went from a Oled to a TN monitor....
that’s such a nice view wow
alright. He basically DDNS himself, the view outside is from an apartment
400hz 5090 and still on gold on everygame is crazy dude
""45 inches is too big to game on""
meanwhile my 49"" monitor:
Same
CARTER YOU ARE NEVER. EVER. EVER BEATING THE RICH ALLEGATIONS
Imagine needing all at, I have that 1660Ti + 21in 75hz
I have that samsung g9 odyssey 49"" 5120x1440p with almost the same pixel density of a 4k.
Its extremely immersive! Best purchase!
Especially for flying games like star citizen with a nice tobii eye tracker!
Are we all just gonna ignore the fact that someone else was holding the camera for him and moving it around at some point?
Next video: “ Soooo I might now have a 720 hertz monitor”
Bros missing the two side monitors
Crazy a vid on pc lol still tho gotta love carter
He’s a big fan watched you every day
Im personally not excited for the 5090, I just dont like AI being used to account for missing firepower. As a supplementary bonus, maybe, but imma stick with the 4060 I have
""45 inches too big to game on"". Me literally gaming on 43 inch non ultra wide monitor.
and im here rockin the 60hz from around 2008 whit a Geforce gtx 980ti
Bros got the Nintendo DS monitors
Carters boxers>>> carters tech content
Says “its to big” proceeds to it bigger
One guy really said cater.
4 minutes later
the curved suppose to be main monitor and then the 480 should be on the side vertically my opinion
just a reminder the bigger the screen THE WORST IT LOOKS, use lose so much ppi
Make a pc that has the best of the best hardware along with everything that can be added to make it better with as much of everything that can be added so you can run the most demanding games with maxed graphics with atleast 300 fps

Congrats!! Looks awesome.
This is great, well done, especially on Twitch!
Great journey, go on!
Girl, you deserve a great desk like that! Good for you!
Thank you for the video it looks nice & I didn't know you had that milestone 10K SUBSCRIBERS CONGRATULATIONS ️ Keep up the good work
That shadow that continues illidans ledge 🥹 fantastic stuff!!
Congratulations! Awesome desk and set up. I was happily a part of your Halloween Sylvanas transmog themed stream ( which was amazing BTW! ). I love your entire room. So many amazing Sylvanas items! One of the few Sylvanas things i actually have like you is that awesome mousepad lol the obvious part makes it hilarious but it's really comfortable and helped with my wrist pain. Congrats again, you are doing an amazing job!!
Congratulations!
Congrats
Awesome to hear
Looks incredible! :)
Wallpaper gives me nostalgia, it used to be mine for such a long time. If you've ever considered using (and have spare pc power to do so) I know wallpaper engine has animated versions that I used for a while as well. Happy you got your new desk tho and hope you continue to enjoy streaming.
Looks amazing!! The new desk is gorgeous!!
Thank you for all your videos! Sadly been unable to play since 2016, so your vids keep me informed of content changes and also let me remember how much I love this game !! Keep them coming !
Congrats!
Great looking set up for an even greater looking gamer
Love this desk! What website did you find this on?!
Tnx i get Glory of Hero 

For your Guid and help

Have you thought about streaming on YouTube? I'd try to watch. I don't do twitch, though. Congrats on the new desk

SLEEP?
A pool table in a gaming room with all the mood lighting is so awesome
For me, just don’t break anything. You can be player 1. You can adjust stuff, just don’t lose them. Don’t rage.
This is not a gamer room. This is a fu**ing paradise.
If a gamer invites me to their gaming room with these rules, I won't even think about coming back
As a gamer with a room similar to this, I feel like I'd be more welcoming.
The most strictest gaming room ever
“Don’t bring girls we are scared of them”
""do not breathe too much""
Bro he sounds like a teacher talking about games
1. Touch whatever you want, just dont break it.
2. You see ""trash"", ask if its trash or not.
3. Grab a snack and a drink from my xbox mini fridge. 
4. Maybe you can take a game borrowed, so as be player n°1. 
5. Sit wherever you want and grab the controller you want. 
What's this? School? Rules are lame. Being more welcoming is better (with some limits of course).
All of them correct but i have one more rule
Dont borrow any devicy unless we let you
I followed the rules and never got a second invite
He has a fucking pool table.
Ye I'm familiar with the rules of gaming rooms thank you very much
Him pushing Minecraft off the table offended me
This dude is way to strict I would never come over again
Bro’s got a whole entire theater arcade room
You’re gaming room is awesome 10 out of 10
Is it just me, or did he say “Never get player number 1, your always player number 1️”
Next time I’m just going to stay home
“no your not allowed to breathe its too loud and will distract the gamer!” ahh be like
PERFECT LOOP
When I go to my friends gaming room I just sit in the beanbag chair and not move bc I’m an actual walking disaster
""Your oppinion doesn't count"" awww what a good friend
I use to have a friend that hated Fortnite let’s just say HE ONLY WANTED TO PLAY MINECRAFT and it was berock
bro even if i didn’t know these rules i would stand there awkwardly either way
Bro is like:-
Do not put your feet on the floor
Don't blink
Dont even breathe
this whole room is just awesome
I wish I had a like good laptop thats legit all I want. But if I did have a room like this then my only rule would be to not break anything cause after all they are guests so you have to welcome them.
I teared up........ it's beautiful 🥹
im a chill guy
Nobody realizes that he is damn right and yes you can play just dont optimize stuff or break something. IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO FOLLOW THESE RULES
How to be single:

Be this guy
Yeah now u need to follow rules to enter a room second time that sets you apart from touching grass for eternity
Sick set up
They aren’t gonna want a second invite if you have such strict rules
Ty for understanding me finely
My friend who literally lets me play Minecraft on his PC in his top notch gaming room
Im a gamer ahh vid
For me I have so much trash when ever my freinds come over they always clean my setup lol
Bro you have such a cool gaming room 
It’s a paradise
that's not a gaming room
its my goddamn dreammmmm
GAMING ROOM 2???
I agree with most of this but not the game choosing one bc they can totally choose
Bro you set up is crazy I only have a 30 hz monitor with a nintindo switch
Even though I don’t have a game room my number one rule is always, I am first player!
i need to show this to my friends
OH YEAH FOR THE IMPERIUM!!!
Respect of ur figures i luv dbz
My friend has one of the most expensive gaming room in town and he doesn't behave like that. 
Whenever i go to his gaming room, there is always two boxes of pizza and some sodas waiting, i would recline his chair, wash my greasy hand and we would play for hours. And when its time to go home, he would give me some games to go home with.
I think most of them are reasonable but picking the game is 100% something that you can habe agency in aswell
This is the difference between a gamer and a friend ngl
I’m a gamer. I am and when my friends come round, I let them play what game they want. I let them choose what game they want but I did break something in my room. They broke my PS5. They punched it but I forgive them but I also broke my doorbut I forgive them.
Respect him to have ps4 cd's
Bro my friends break all these rules in my gaming room
With those rules i don't want anymore to go into a gamer's room
If the rules are like this,Im not going to gamer's room.
Yo your gaming room is sick, how much did it cost?
If im a gamer with that room i would allow them to do anything they want but they can't throw the ""trash"" or lose something when they adjust the setup

Sony made 8k games on the ps5 pro but I think the we should be asking is who has a 8k monitor
I like the xbox controller more tho
If someones really a ""hardcore competitive gamer"" whos trying to min max performance, they wouldnt be looking at consoles anyway
Xbox series x already had the features PS5 pro has. Plus two simple options regarding performance or quality with upscaling. Not to mention backwards compatibility…
I would say buy a PS5, PS5 slim, or a Series X instead of the PS5 Pro because that's a $300 dollar increase from the PS5 and you can build or buy a better PC with $700
Ps5 pro:2024 console / Xbox series x:2020 console
In raw power the xbox is mote powerful than the normal ps5, the only reason that won is because its newer and is upscaleing a lower resolution.
I love ur content man
You might as well build a budget pc for that $700 price tag
For me I feel like the xbox has less delay but me there both mid compared to my pc
Just plug in the controller and save 200 dollars its not worth slightly more fps
“Extra performance” yeah bro like an extra 3 fps, we’ve all seen them comparación videos of the regular ps5 & pro
Im sorry but no one should buy that 700 dollar rip off
@Fluxphy input delay is based on the polling rate of the controller not the console, Xbox Controller Polling Rate 125hz, PlayStation Dualsense Polling Rate - 250hz, If you get a Third party wired controller for Xbox you would not be able to tell the difference.
Also, if you're not gaming with a wired controller then you're not playing competitive.
50 ping is good? I guess my 14 ping is god tier.
If someone is a hardcore gamer they have to use a pc
Xbox series x also supports 8K WITHOUT UPSCALING
The real question is are you gonna to buy an 8k tv or monitor
Just get PC you. An 3050 and r5 5600 700 or better if you build it yourself
now its 100 dollars less
Just get a pc
Just get a $600 pc
I have xbox game pass on 2 devices and controllers so im looking for a console and its a no brainer

I have ps5 pro and the problem is the comfort of controller so if that isn’t good I will always go back to xbox controller comfort is very important
How about Xbox series s on warzone is it solid in the future
What’s interesting to note is that the Series X runs a handful of games slightly better than the PS5 Pro, like Alan Wake 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Space Marine 2. In most other situations, they’re extremely close to one another, with just certain titles pulling ahead on the Pro. 

Even after 5 years, the Series X is still a very potent machine, being able to run an open world UE5 title like Stalker 2, which utilizes both lumen and nanite, at 1440p upscaled to 4K, and Indiana Jones at 1800p, 60 fps, with RTGI enabled.
At $700 the PS5 Pro is not doing enough for that kind of money. If it was an open platform like PC then maybe I can see a good value proposition. But it lacks important features like the disc drive, native keyboard and mouse support, a vertical stand. You gotta have these things included with your premium product.
The pro ugly is crap. Ps5 is the ugliest. I hope they get rid of that glossy crap on the ps6. I prefer Xbox hardware.
They had to come out with a pro to barely beat Xbox
The XSX have more teraflops which means it CANNOT have lower fps. Plus on a test the ps5 get 120-100 fps while the XSX has 120-115. Pick PS5 for
Exclusives.
Best Controller Features.
Cheaper Subscription.
And Better Coonectivity.
Pick XSX if:
You want better fps and graphics
You want exclusives like fh5,starfield,and halo. (Fh5 is on ps5 now).
And if you need browsing, streaming and all those features.
As well as if you want the gamepass which is better you get access to 100AAA games for more money.
But if you're willing to play fortnite more. Go for the XSX.
What camera you got?
If the new Pro doesn't out due a 5 year old series X ye ponies truly would of been shafted.....
Bro PS5 PRO OFC IS BETTER CAUSE IS NEWER FASTER XBOX SERIES X CAME OUT 5 YEARS AGO OFC PS5 “PRO” WINS IF YOU HAD XBOX SERIES X GALAXY OFC THEY ARE THE SAME CAUSE IS NEWER
PlayStation
If your just going to get a ps5 just get the normal one it's less expensive and but if you have a xbox one you might need an upgrade tell me if am wrong
Xbox 2020 ps 2024 u cant compare
Can they run Crisis
PlayStation fanboy prolly never actually played Xbox, only probably got it to hate it
PS5 pro. It's gonna be better it's the pro
XBOX BULT DIF
I just belive xbox is better then ps5 even tho i play on xbox series x and pc
Xbox series x beter
Just get a pc dawg

PS 5 is always the best

pink like even thebuzzling on the side the buttons are allpink I have like the second wrist restit's a little bunny I got it from likeuh wish or something and I just just puta bunch of these posters

succulent it's a fakesucculent cuz I can't take care ofplants but she's so pretty and I lovehow the strawberry is pink I'm astrawberry girl I got it from box lunchand I actually got her like discountedbecause she had this on her bow and itwas the last one in store and I think Igot her for like $3 or something I waslike yeah I'll take her and then overthis way we have my steam deck I think Ihad washi tape on it originally and Ijust didn't like how it looked so I gotthis cover on Etsy and I love it I haveto repaint the stand cuz as you can seemy painting skills suck don't look at ittoo close and I love how you can putlike a littlewallpaper onyour is it called the steam deck elatoright it's not a streamdeck stream deck it's a stream deckright oh my God I don't know what Icalled it uh don't rewind my steamdeck steam deck um but I love how youcan put a little wallpaper on it so Iput a Hello Kitty and friends one cuz ofcourse why would I not and then behindit I have the times gate from deom theyhave a pink variant now and I love it soso much it is so so pretty it's meant tobe used like a clock which would come inI should use it as a clock but I justlove displaying super cute pixel art onit on top of it I just have my smiiesthey look so cute they're just doingthese are the from the yoga series ifthere's one thing about me I'm alwaysgoing to be an RGB girl I saw Tik Toksaying like oh 2020 PC setup Tik Tok wasall about RGB lights cringe and I waslike then right next to it I have thisnew figure I got from popmart it's fromthe skull Panda the warmth series and Ipulled the all pink one and I think itjust looks perfect on my desk I lovehaving little figurines and toys andthings like that on my setup I think itjust looks so cute and right next to itI have a second USB hub this one's MyMelody I'm going to be honest I don'tknow what that connector is for I don'tknow what that's connecting it'sconnecting something but she's heremainly if I need more USB plugins andthen right next to it I have my Nintendoswitch with a really cute Paco case Itook the joycons off cuz the joycons Ihave on it wouldn't fit into the dockand then right next to it I just havethis little myy she could be wall artthe girl that sold it to me also shecould be a coaster but she's just toocute to use as a coaster and then backthere kind of hidden I have my tiltedNation headset stand with my headsetthat I use it's a yaho cat ear headsetand white it's a really good headset butI will say if I wear it for too long Iget kind of a headache right next to mydesk I have a drawer and on top of it ismy PC which is going to be changing soonI've had her since like 2019 and I don'tknow if you can hear let me stop yappingI having the hardest time runningcertain games InfinityNikki I love you Rogue but it's time foran upgrade so I've been saving up forthat and I'm so close to getting thatupgrade all set up so expect to seeanother video on that when it happens itshould be soon hopefully let me be sillyfor a moment I also just don't like howshe looks at the time when we built herI didn't have a lot of space I stilldon't but I have a little bit more spaceand I had to get a mini tower and atthat time they didn't have I couldn'tfind any cute pink Towers now there aremore options and I also don't have anylike lighting so it's just likea it look so serious and like not mystyle especially because like I said Ilove RGB lighting and pixel art and allthat I think it just stands out likelook at my setup andthen look at my setup and so I'm excitedto get a build that actually matcheswhat I want and here is the microphonethat I use the microphone and the standare both by fafine the microphone isactually a really good quality for itjust being a USB plugin go microphone soI definitely recommend it if you'relooking into getting a new microphonethat is Affordable but really goodquality I got so excited cuz I've beenwanting one of these like low profilemicrophone mounts I don't even rememberhow my old microphone stand was cuz I'vebeen wanting a low one like this for solong and F fine made an affordable oneoriginally in white so I had the whiteone and I was like a I wish it was inpink and I I checked on their Amazon afew months later and they released apink one and it is so so pretty it wasreally easy to set up and I just lovethe color pink and how it matches theirmicrophone and then on it I just put alittle Kopi cuz of course and then I putthis My Melody Dark Magician Girl thisis the one I really really wanted sowhen I got her I was like yes right uphere I have the ring light that I useduse I did have another one on this sidebut it fell down so that's the nextthing I'm also changing I'm saving up toget new ring lights cuz this one's justnot bright enough I would love theElgato key lights and then I just havesome Nano leaves I didn't have enough tomake a heart so like I made like thisface but like it looks like a JackoLantern I'm not going to lie these keptfalling off and we finally got them tostay on and it's been a few months knockon wood knock on wood that they're notgoing to fall anytime soon but uh yeahI'm not I'm not switching that I stilluse the same camera for streaming cuz itjust it look the picture looks reallygood uh but I don't like how the cameralooks like this just on its own eventhough I got this really cute likelens I don't even know what this is casefor it and it's little My Melody ears Istill didn't like how it looked so I gotthis camera case and it's supposed to belike a carrying bag so now I have likeon My Melody I don't know I I think itlooks a lot cuter that way and then Idon't like the mount that I have I hadto spray paint it I also had to like sawthis part of it cuz it was going up waytoo high I don't know the science orreasoning behind why it was going up sohigh so I just have like this randomhole here and I was like oh let me justcover itwith this little keychain I have and I'mnot a big fan of this monitor mounteither just because I'm used to havingmy two monitors like right next to eachother that's as close as I can bringthem with this Mount uh so I'm hopingwith the new pixio one I could bringthem closer together I have a keyboardwall over there but I'm not going toshow it cuz it's kind of messy maybeI'll save that for another video and Ican give yall a tour of the keyboardsthat I have in my current rotation oh Iguess I should show the chair that I usethis is the love of my life the secretlab Titan chair I love this chair Iliterally recommend it to anyone it isso so comfortable and I think it's likeso worth the investment I can't believeI used any other chair besides this oneI literally have had no issues with myback whatsoever

thisevery year in this video guys I'm goingto be talking about all the upgradesthat happen in 2024 the plans that Ihave in 2025 to swap out some of thetech and DIY projects and things that Ican recommend and during the course ofthis video I'm just going to Pepper inas I stop by certain places as Iremember what has come in and whathasn't it's going to be somewhatdisorganized but I want to be able tojust speak my mindand talk to you guys directly so I'm notgoing to be heavily editing this videoas I head over to CES tomorrow so gomake sure that you guys follow me onInstagram at Game Room Theater and I'llbe sharing a lot of content there so I'mgoing to start back in this corner asyou can see a lot has definitely changedin2024 um I re I changed the configurationof the seating this is Valencia Theaterseating um it's their Prestige line andGuys these are now almost 3 years oldI've always worried about this pianofinish and um you know people put theirphones down their jewelry or whateveryou know the backs of watches it isslightly scratched up as you can see maymaybe you can just barely make it out Ijust cleaned this and I just vacuumedthe seats for this video um but you canyou can certainly see some indents andimperfections but overall held up reallyreally nicely I changed up theconfiguration becauseuh you know I had three seats there andtwo here thinking I can't do this longof a line it'll close off the space toomuch to to enter but I realized when Imeasured it out that uh it's going to beabsolutely fine cuz this is the mainviewing that you get you know sitting inthese three uh I mean sure you you youhurt your neck a little bit but it's notas bad as people often comment in myvideos that these guys you know hisfriends that sit in these seats mightget cramps not really I mean this isbarely a 30° angle and my perspective onit is I wanted to still feel like astadium where you know seating issurrounding this so I have some extraseating when people come over that Ifold out and put out there uh which Iusually end up on by the way cuz I youknow I like treating my guests so thatthey're comfortable that they're cateredto and they're looked after before I amso it's a blessing to have guests andyou know anyway I'm getting distractedbut long and short of it I wanted tofeel like a stadium around this thingand that's why I have seating here aswell and plus I can't I can't putseating there uh it would really closeoff the space and I can't add moreseating here because there's no entry tothis area then so I've made peace withit this is how I'm I'm going to have itand uh and that's kind of it as for thistable nothing's really changed if youguys remember this is a table from soberdesign uh coffee table drinks are alwaysnearby I love my Barbie cans uh anywayand then on top of thisthis I change up and theme up often thereason why I do that I know it's sofreaking extra but I love it guys um youknow this is my seat I love this seatbecause as you know usually people comeover they're sitting on this side sorryI just hit the the camera um but uh whenI'm sitting here I I like being able tosee all of this and the my otherfavorite seat because you know this isjust way too close to the to the giantscreen is this because then I can seeeverybody and everything like especiallyif for hosting a party I like look atthat look at that view let me just letme just zoom in a little bit look at theview from here guys it's uh you knowI've had uh it's it's it's reallysurreal for me how this all turned outanyway going on into this space again uhyou know I've changed this up many timeswhere I theme it out as if I'm at theevent right like you know say you're atSofi stadium and they have this awesomemini Jumbotron there this is from miniJumbotron decom by the way I have avideo on this where I've automated andshow live stats and you know there's agame on Rangers versus the capitals uhgoing on right now I have a full DIYvideo you guys if you already follow meyou may have already seen that so anywayI love changing this out and creatingthat atmosphere of watching a big gameand being there craziness with tickersand lighting and people are like oh myGod it's a crazy sensory overload you soyou do things that uh are to your tasteuh to my taste this feels like thecraziness of a stadium where there's fogmachines going off light lighting goingoff loud sounds uh you know things likeinformation all over the place I I loveit I love it and perhaps you might likesome certain aspects of it so this is aholographic fan from a company called UHol FX and I've got links to everythingin my bio guys so just go to my linktree if you're curious I I list it a lotthis is simply a mat a mat I found umonline for uh for for it's a it's alarge computer mouse and it's I liked itbecause the back is this rubbery feeland it doesn't move and it just createsthis awesome effect by the way this isconnected by Wi-Fi you can push whateverimages and logos you want I don't wantany hate from you guys I'm an Eagles fanum and it is what it is so they aredoing awesome this season by the way umanyway let me see where else I can gonext so this has swapped out and this isbig I won't talk about in the end NanoLeaf lighting guys uh the ticker is Bigtoo I'll get into that in a second theprojector is the same from 2020 end of2023 this is the awal vision LTV 3500Pro and um in my opinion an endgamelaser triple laser projector 3500 lumensit is incredible quality uh look at thislook at this thing and it's got cabinetspace you know you put a PS5 uh stufflike that in there I've got a lot offans and things running inside thisthing look here anyway let me zoom in alittle bit so it's a little brighter foryou guys so all my stuff is in there Iput a bunch of USB fans to keep it extracool and this is all power that's what'sreally really dramatic let me pause fora second and show you guys what it lookslike with the TVbehind all right so this is what itlooks like with the 75 in that I've hadfor a long time back here let me zoomout you guys get a a full-blown shothere um so zooming back in this is howawesome and Theatrical this is guys whenthis thing opens up so I have a smart uhroutine on my Harmony remote so I holdthis down for more than 2 seconds thenthis will open up and it is so dramaticnow look at this this is a power drawerthat's opening up you seethat I love freaking out my friends whenthey come over if they don't you knowbelieve it or not some of my friendsdon't even know I have a social mediathey're just like wow this is cool uhand anyway look how neat that is soit'll search for the signal and thenlook I got a I got a giant screen thatopened up on top and again this is anambient light rejecting screen this isthe whole this whole thing this entirecabinet is from awall vision and theythey sell this thing integrated you canyou can buy the uh the floor Risingscreen that fits perfectly in there aswell um and again this is an a ambientlight rejecting screen so lights fromthe top get rejected and and that's whythe contrast ratio looks so awesome andoften people just kind of assume thatthis is a giant TV when it's not and itreflects light from the bottom I'vetalked about it before you guys can seemy review videos on uh on the USprojectors that I've done uh uh quite abit of in the past so um I'll be doing alighting video soon guys you knowthere's certain tips and tricks thatI've got that a lot of people uh oftenask about that I haven't had a chance toshare but I will be sharing in thefuture so I hope you guys uh check thatvideo outas for uhtickers I've got long proper legittickers now and as you can see this is ascrolling ticker there's anotherscrolling ticker there this is fromglance LED this is hey look go

Stewart pretty awesomeguy NBA player uh let's just keep goinghere you know there's mylogo yeah I made a Max for stoppingvideo but uh anyway let me turn this offfor now I usually turn this on whenpeople are over I put this way in theback cuz it's a little dangerous withblade spinning I don't have a cover forit so um I'll I'll go to this next youknow I put the 112 scale cars now uphere is just running out of room whereto put them and I wanted to keep itsomewhat near on my crazy F1 stuff so uhunderneath it though now this is anabsolute Beauty this is my favoritearcade in the room right

justthe fact that it's got thousands ofgames it's it's a fact that it's bigit's big and it's it's got a it's it'sgot a lot of play area uh it it's I puta I did modify this a little bit I put asubwoofer in there I don't know if it'stoo dark to see but know there's alittle amp that controls the audio theaudio is excellent and there's a there'sa computer that runs it all so thisthing is pretty darn awesome uh man cavearcades you know check these guys out uhcompletely completely worthit and moving on you guys have seen myNBA Jam still having my coffee by theway not a great place to put it but itis what it is this is just brand newthis just came in 3 days ago this isfrom a company called at games um if youremember I had the uh Star Wars machinehere for the last 3 years I still lovevirtual pinball guys cuz you can changeit up this is actually an Adams Familyunit and I'm old school you know I grewup as I was very very young when thisshow started coming out and it was justincredible excuse me it was incrediblewatching this um so you can change thisup to whatever you want there's hundredsand hundreds of tables uh that you candownload you know and there's hapticfeedback there's actually surround soundso as the balls rolling uh you can feelit you know you can feel it back herethere's a subwoofer in here it's almostlike a small PC that's rning runninginside this thing very very smooth and Ilove the size of this thing this is uhonce again this is from at games it'stheir Legend pinball 4K and this happensto be the Adams Family uh unit so againbrand new just came in I'm still messingaround with it this is bumper pool thepeople that keep asking I've had thisfor several years I won't talk about ityou can watch some of my older videos uhthis I made DIY uh a few years ago Iwant spend more time on it you know costabout 300 bucks to to build you cancheck out one of my older videos andit's been there for the last 3 years nowthis I'm only going to talk about mypoker table I'm only going to talk aboutthis simply because this thing isgetting a little long in the tooth umit's pretty banged up and damaged youguys can everything looks pretty from adistance right like you know from adistance this is all gorgeous lookingbut there's you know the people comeover not that they're necessarily roughbut accidents happen look at thisthere's a rip in the in the leather umyou know the the the chairs are startingto fall apart a little bit separatingand you know this hitting the back ofwalls it's got a little bit of a hole init now so anyway stuff stuff happens butit all looks pretty in online H uh youknow only I see the imperfections nobodyelse really sees it this I'm not goingto talk about this I've had for severalyears as well this is from a companycalled candy machinesum this section is completely let mezoom out a little bit this section iscompletelychanged you know just last year I didhave a pool table here and I took thatout um I expanded I've always wanted tobe a pilot growing up you know it justnever that dream never came true so thisis the next best thing guys this is fromnext best thing next level racing thisis theymake awesome stuff as well racing rigwise and look at this this is fromthrustmaster got the thrust controlthere uh this is for the rudder controlin the back and it is a prettyincredible experience when my awalvision LTV 3000 Pro that's the ultrashort throw 4K projector that goes intogame mode so super low latency and uhplay Ling on something this large it isvery very immersive right like as you'resitting here you know controlling thisyour entire field of view is taken up itit it puts a grin on my face from ear toear uh and then the other thing that youmay notice is right here these deviceslet me just go close instead of zoomingin uh so the I've got um a F fourspeakers and two subs this isalso from awal Vision the company thatmakes that um they make wirelesssurround sound systems those are twosubs that they they also provide in theBox it's called the product is calledthunderbeat it is pretty damn coolplaying immersive surround sound asyou're flying around and differentsounds are happening you know like AdobeAtmos effect with the speakers firing upit it is really really cool and allwirelessly done all I did was put thatdongle in that you see right there theyjust automatically sync and connect umhighly highly recommended if you'regetting that projector and then theawesome thing about that is this Centerthis has a a significant wattage speakerbuilt in and this ends up becoming acenter channel while this is yoursurround uh so so this is your frontright front left surround left uhsurround right and then your sub channelso that ends up AC acting as a centerchannel so you get your true uh5.1 but again there's two subs so 5.2really uh and this is also a go-kart sooften you know sometimes I uh my my myson will battle me in an F1 race forexample uh playing on this this is alsoa Next Level racing go-kart uh while Isit and play there in the same track Ium I turn on a I turn off a lot offeatures that are like the AI assist andstuff just so I don't have an unfairAdvantage um but uh yeah he often beatsme he's got better reflexes than I domaybe you should be a race car driver umso anyway moving on to the theater Iwon't talk about this as much because ithasn't CH like stuff that you see herehasn't changed a whole lot all myequipment rack stuff is all the same umyou know once again there's 11 speakersin here all AR rendle sound I've gotthree giant Towers behind this screen uhthat are uh this is an acousticallytransparent SC screen from Elon Vision Idid upgrade my projector to a laser thatis the BenQ W5 5800 highly recommendedcheck out my review video on that fromearlier from mid 2024 a fantastic laserprojector and the image and thebrightness is is just incredible as youguys can see you know just beautifulbeautiful image that it and and the popand color brightness the accuracyabsolutely fantastic anyway anothermajor upgrade that I walked right by asI don't know if you guys noticed in someof my previous videos lighting umlighting control specifically so as youcan see I used to have some shuttersthere for all the giant Windows you knowit is Subterranean I don't want to feeldepressed and be in the basement all thetime right right so uh I can uh I havethe these smart connected blinds now soif I say turn the game room on uh allthese blinds will typically close aseverything turns on assuming that I'mtypically watching at night but if Iwant to open the blinds you know they'resmart connected I can just say turn theopen the blinds uh but you know I canalso do it manually you know with aremote as you can see and it changes thevibe completely you know you get abright sunny day and look how look howmore inviting it became and a goodconsequence this is again a greatdemonstration of ambient light rejectingscreens this is that awall Vision againlook at this light hitting here and it'seating itup it looks just as awesome you knowsure you get a little bit of a contrasthit on certain sides but a perfectlywatchable absolutely giant screen andagain the vibe changes and also the vibechanges when I sayturn the main pot lightson so you guys will see in a second allthese lights will start changing to runas regular pot lights you seethis all of these just switch backup and that one some of them take longerthan than others but you can see thatthey're switching back up to run asregular pot lights which is a prettycool effect by the way the these I kindof left so that they don't ras uh as brightly just because thescreen is over there but the vibe of theroom has completely changed because Idon't want it dark with you know the biguh LED lights all over the place allthe time but again look at that giantscreen and it still displays beautifullywith all the lights on switched back toregular regular lighting with with theblinds open with direct with pretty muchdirect sunlight comingthrough okay maybe I'll leave it likethis this bright but maybe you guys cancomment in the comments here like youknow do you do you like the look of thethe lights all you know basically inambient mode where it was doing thatEclipse halo effect and or like thiswith the blinds open and bright and uhmore I feel that it's a little bit moreclinical this way but you know sometimesI like changing things up so anyway thispart let me just talk about what plans Ihave for uh 2025 it isonly January 4th I think and U I'll begoing to CES by the way so go once againgo check out my Instagram I'll besharing a whole lot of stories of newtech that's coming out it's the world'slargest electronic show that happens inVegas every year um and I'll have uhI'll have a lot to share from there soso what I plan on doing this year um Idon't have huge plans to change upanything heredrastically maybe and it's a long shotthese might get swapped out withsomething else um but uh more to come onthat by the way I am building ChrisBrown's man cave right now um it's goingto be absolutely freaking epic so watchfor that video to drop at some point inFebruary or March I've I've uh been overto this place about four or five timesawesome dude uh it's going to be prettyincredible I'm going to be doing severalother celebrities this year hopefully somake sure you guys uh check out mycontent um and follow me on on inespecially on Instagram just for thataspect of it uh cuz it'll be reallyinteresting some NBA players and someNFL players some big time ones too thatactually follow me there it's prettyhumbling guys it's just my socialmedia's really exploded over there anduh I want to I want to feed it with somethings every so often um so the bigthing that I'm really looking forward toand hopefully it happens and it's a highpriority is I've already got uh Basshakers in this thing so that you knowyou feel the rumbles of the road and theengine and stuff there's a so trackracer has uh that uh um uh Shaker thereand then there's one underneath the seatbut what I really really want is motionI want to be ableto as I'm driving feeling the G's as thewhole thing turns so hopefully a deboxbased motion system uh will be availableon this and then this while I'm talkingabout that the second thing would be Iam likely going to replacethis right here this go-kart we probablygo upstairs you maybe my son's room orsomething um I want a drift rig you knowthe drift rigs with the the differentwheels and sequential shift as well Iwant that um so hopefully that'll happenthis yearthat would be the next uh major thingand in the theater there may be somechanges again because I usually uh Iusually change up the projector veryvery often you know the rest of the techthe screen and and other things don'treally change all that much but I I willlikely end up changing the projector sostay tuned I you know I usually havesome some coolrecommendations and uh I'll be sharingthat uh uh very very soon and while I'min the game room my friends at AVStyles they will likely be here at somepoint and awesome guys guys uh checkthem out on uh Instagram as well um I'vealways been eyeing a starry ceiling andI will likely finally get that done inthe theater room you know to create thateffect of it's basically fiber opticswith like a shooting star going and justthat little twinkle that you see um youknow if you've seen any videos of thosehigh-end Rolls-Royce cars you theceiling liner that they've got that kindof thing so that is going to be prettydamn awesome um I know I'm all over theplace guys but you know I get I stillget a whole lot of questions on this Ido intend on doing a more dedicatedvideo explaining this in a lot moredetail my digital signage how I controlit and all of that but in the meantimejust do check out that ticker videocheck out my Jumbotron video and becausethat shows you a lot of my automationthe rest is just really formatting andcontrol like you know keep keep in mindguys like you know I show everything offin one big shot and everyone just kindof assumes like oh my God I can't dothis or you get overwhelmed um you knowyou're going to take SE sections piecesof this and apply it to your own spacesand that's what the intention of mysocial media is guys like that's where Ifind the most Joy um is when peoplerespond like hey I didn't know I coulddo this hey awesome ideas uh I'm goingto take this and then I and then I seeit implemented by thousands of peopleout there and that's where I feelhumbled like wow this is this is awesomeyou know people have taken some of myideas and you do it if you do DIY it'sthat mucheasier um cost-wise it's Le less costagain digital signage is still thenumber one thing that draws a lot ofpeople uh into my social mediaso anyway I'll show you guys upstairsvery very briefly let me get get upthere right now okay I just told thefamily to stay kind of quiet cuz I'mrecordingaudio anyway I'm going upstairs guys sohere's what the entrance looks like letme turn back around I did add anotherticker there cuz you know it's just thethe craziness I just wanted to make itinviting as you come downstairs that heythis is the approach some movie postersuh and uh um if you guys remember in anolder video I shared if I'm playinganything in the movie theater it'lldisplay the poster and the runtime ofwhat's playing in the theaterautomatically and you can check out thevideo on how I did that so that tickeragain is the scrolling ticker from uhglance LED and I actually put a SmartLock here as well a thumb print readerit's just kind of more theatrical thananything but let's go back into myoffice and I'll just briefly talk aboutthis it hasn't changed a whole lot it'sjust you know some of the stuff that Iran out of room for the arcades ofarcade one-ups have made it up here andI'm probably going to be selling a wholebunch of these cuz I want to change thisspace up to be different a bit classierand um you know as you can see the thethe other pinball from at games is nowdown there I brought my Star Wars upupstairs heavily modified as well but uhmore to come in 2025 going to changethat space up quite a bitall right back downstairs soaesthetically I mean as you guys cantell there's not going to be hugechanges but you know some thingssometimes some things happen verysporadically as my mind's always activeI enjoy the journey rather than thedestination so you know for me it's likeI I I'm pretty grateful to God for allthat I have but at the same time for methe enjoyment is actually in like youknow I'll sit here and be like wow thisis freaking cool and then uh and then belike okay now what so that's where myendorphin release is I have to be inmotion I can't sit still too long andthat's why this place will continue tochange up I have no idea what else 2025will bring but it you can guaranteethings will be changing here and I'll besharing my best practices be you knowbest bang for the buck I want to do somevideos where you know there's a tieredapproach uh you know if you're if you'rejust starting off and you got a budgetof less than 10 grand what you can whatcan what you can do under 5 grand whatyou can do under 50 Grand 100 Grand 200Grand or sky the limit what I would doso I I want to make some video contentuh uh on that as well by the way I keptwalking by this darn thing this thing isfreaking awesome so I got chewed out inmy in my uh comments forever for yearsthat people would often comment that youknow everything's awesome but why doesthis guy have like a$50 um uh golf mat that's that's rolledout so you know I finally replaced itwith something that is much much nicer Ihave a link to it in my bio you knowthis just got this grass feel even ifyou don't play it look how freakinggorgeous this thing looks look at it youknow when people come over you know Ihave these in there now I like lookingat it but these are off and out cuz youknow kids are running around I don'twant this stuff breaking either sothat'll get uh uh that'll get put awaybut anyway guys I hope you enjoyed thisvideo I know it's been long in Ramblingum let me know in the comments if youprefer videos like this or the highlyedited ones where I've got some snazzyedits and different things going on oryou prefer it like that I hope you guysenjoy my content

I wish my house had a basement
Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven. Can I so come over? I'll bring the beer and pizza. Sure I live in Australia, but I'm on the next plane out. Freaking awesome setup my new friend
youre really living the dream. mancaves like this are what inspire me to keep mine fresh and clean.
i will have a cave like this one day videos like this give me inspiration and motivation cuz this is the goal im doing all the hard work for
Man, you've outdone yourself. This is by far the best setup I've seen. Kudos!
Love your setup tours. Everything looks great! If I ever strike it rich I want to hire you to make my dream mancave!
Amazing as always!!!!
Your wire management is out of this world
Love you're videos and how you present you're ""projekt basement"" gives a lot of inspiration for everyone no matter the budget ️
You have absolutely ZERO competition for “Gameroom/Man-Cave/Everything-In-One” Room of the Forever!! Damn
best mancave i've ever seen.
Awesome tour as always! Great video
Wow!! Couldn't imagine the cost of all this. Looks amazing bro.
Love the way when blinds open and white lighting so cool .great set up
I wish I could live in a house like yours
Man, you've got Outrun, that's an awesome game!! You just need to add Wrestlefest in there and Simpsons Arcade (the rare Beavis and Butt-Head arcade machine would be awesome) but this is a fantastic setup.

Congrats on all your hard work, you've done a wonderful job!!
This looks so dope!! I love your setup tours. Everything looks great! If I was rich I'd definitely hire you to make my dream mancave!
For the BLACK Piano finish on your seats, get them VINYL WRAPPED the same color and then you don't have to worry about them getting scratched
Awesome video. Love the home theater and the big screens with the theater seats.
Always loving your theatre looking forward to CES.
What a crazy basement! I want one too!
Nothing to see here just a pair of Virgil Abloh LV air forces sitting on a claw machine!!!!!!! No big flex dude I'm watching in amazement then what !!!!!!! That's crazy boss !
Love it...Nice!
Amazing
Looks awesome
That is a beautiful setup.
This is so cool, man. Totally relate to the feeling of having to remain in motion and enjoy the journey even more than the destination. But don’t forget to really take the time to enjoy it with your friends and family. Now what ?
Love the natural light part of the video. If you’re ever in Michigan, stop by and give me some tips. LOL!
Go Birds!!!
If you have a fibrenew in your area they could color match and repair the leather marks
I don’t care how many times you said it and I watched it! I want to hear everything again!


Some of us have ADHD
Good work brother
The Eagles did alright this year
Thanks
Yooo! I just subscribed
knows the lightbill is through the roof AKA not cheap lol.Awsome job with the setup man you severve it hard work pays off!
The electric bill must be massive!
Need that digital signage video ASAP brother! Set up looks clean AF
Nice. Halfway makes me wanna post my setups. I'm pretty extreme but not anywhere near this level haha
VERY NICE ROOM!
if i had a place like this, i would not let anyone stay in there for longer than 2 minutes. They definitely would not be able to touch anything.
What a Dream. This feels so official auf legit . Great Work. Please consider to answer my question. There are two smaller screens on the wall right to the big screen showing rising bubbles in a circle . Is this wallpaper available on youtube? Find it so appealing especially in your room. Thanks
Did I spy a Louis Vuitton Air Force 1? We need to see a sneaker collection now!
I have been using your setup as one of my main inspirations for my own fan cave. I have a smaller space, but I'm using some of the same ideas. The thing is, I love a bunch of teams (Sens, Leafs, Jays, Vikings, Raptors and Celtics) in different sports, and I want the zone to convert totally to feel like a true fan zone for each of those teams when they are playing. So I've got a bunch of screens (8 small screens in addition to my main central display). It's easier to convert images on screens than to swap out physical objects -- and cheaper too. By combining that with the Nanoleaf lighting with different team themes, plus just a few physical items (like team logo cushions) that I can bring out before a given team is playing, it's starting to feel like I have 6 fan caves rather than one. Plus I can't wait for the next F1 season! Not done yet... just putting on some of the finishing touches... but I just wanted to thank you for some of the ideas (especially the main principle that your fan cave can have many 'faces'/themes to it. But when it's quiet and no games are one, my Sens are always the true #1 in my fan zone! PS- Sadly, my first true fan zone game I watched with my new setup was last night's Vikings/Lions game -- apparently my dedicated fanship didn't help secure top seed for Minnesota!!
nice
Go birds!!!
what a stunning basement masallah
Great content once again there mate. When you showed the golf flags at the end how you don’t want them broken by the kids have you considered using magnets on the flags so they will just fall over and not break? Just an idea… Look forward to the next one ️
Got to try and get LTT to see this room. They would love it.
How much was all of this?! What job do I need to do to get this in my house
go birds!
GO BIRDS!!!!
You have done an incredibly good job with that game room,,,,,when's then next B.Y.O.B ? #Aztec73
Would you consider a Valerion Max for a lifestyle projector in your future upgrades? The
EBL, vertical lens shift & dynamic iris are really something. Maybe the AWOL USTD pro's will have that feature on the next line.The projector is slated for May 2025 release.
This is insane I’ve followed you on Instagram for a long time but never watched a full walkthrough of yours on YouTube. Crazy setup. I’m looking at getting an UST projector very soon is there anything to look out for or buying tips you could give me? Wanting to run a fixed 120 inch ALR screen. I’ll be watching movies on it but also I do a lot of gaming. Thanks dude!
Thank you for sharing your update! What brand/model are the ceiling pot lights?
Obsessed with your space. Which model ticker do you have above your main screen? Is it Glance or skybox? The quality is great, kind of looks like the one you made, only with the ""ticker"" feature.
Random/stupid request - if you come across a smart dog/pet door at CES could you post that to your social? Pawport was shown there last year but it’s been CRICKETS since from the company
What do you do for work???
How can you call this a man cave without a nice indoor golf simulator
Do you have a detailed walkthrough video for your digital signage?
The coffee table is also a fridge no?
When are you going to do a garage update on your garage
GO BIRDS!!!
Where did you get that coffee table
Hey man - where did you get the long scrolling ticker you have mounted above the TV at 8:32?
Hey did you say digital sinage far as the two pink and blue led signs
What’s your ceiling height. I’ve been thinking about getting a Vividstorm floor rising projector and I’m at 7 feet.
Awesome Content and showcasing this Mancave! Also, we sent you an email about our cool mounts perfect for any mancave setup, love for you to check it out when you get a chance. Keep up the great content!James
Now add a real pinball machine. You got this
Hey! Can you please tell me what size is this space including home theatre ?
I know your electric bill is wild if you’re not on solar.
You got rid of the table tennis table and some of your Arcade1Ups.
Is the ticker above the TV a Glance Scroll Pro also or something else?
Awesome basement
I had to put my Gameroom in the upstairs loft, Is this a basement? Do you live up north cause we don’t have basements in Florida
FlyEaglesFly
I can’t seem to find your link for the pot lights?
Mom can we go over uncle house please mom please
What size is your basement
Wait, just to clarify, you're talking about Chris Brown the Canadian musician, and not Chris Brown the guy who assaulted Rhianna, correct? I got really confused at first.
Really nice setup building a home now sorry I got you banned on neogaf
I know it might look weird at first but for the two chairs on the wall
By the tv . You should angle the chairs at like 20-30 degree angle so they can view it better.
Shame movkng kart rig if your son loves playing against you
All I gotta say is can I have some money please
Must be nice to be rich...
E.A.G.L.E.S.

years later and I spent over $50,000 on gaming setups and today I'm reacting to a 100 of the best gaming setups from my Discord to inspire and motivate you I'm not only going to be reacting though I'll be raing every single person and giving tips and tricks so you can start improving your setup ASAP this is honestly the video I wish I had 12 years ago because my setup would have gotten so much better a lot faster and I don't want you to make this same mistakes I did so let's go ahead and get started with setup number one this is Smitty Mason setup okay okay 15 years old from Texas already an amazing setup for 15 he streams on YouTube and he's a high school student that's great as well love the peripherals here his main game is fortnite that's awesome I love everything in the setup so far his old setup was just a Chromebook that's kind of a come up though I can't even lie that's a come up inspiration for his setup is to never stop or settle that's cool I love this room dude just the room in general the lights coming down the wall goie lights up here the aesthetic the panels the lighting in between all of that's amazing it gets it earnings from YouTube and Creator code Revenue dang okay he bought a setup from Creator code revenue on fortnite he started building my setup in June 2020 okay so he's went from 2020 to now they started building this when he was 13 so basically content and live streaming is what he uses it for but looking at the setup I love everything I mean from the cable management to the usefulness of every single part of the desk he's used on everything is in a has its place it's beautiful looking like just like the cable management as well is managed very well I just love like the whole aesthetic I think personally this is like a 9 or a 9.5 out of 10 I really enjoy the aesthetic of this I think the aesthetic is what sets it up for me and then not to mention all how clean his cable management is it's great this is Archie's setup I love this already he's 15 years old from England man a lot of 15year olds in the setup in the setup video holy he makes Tech talk content okay his main game is Call of Duty and this PC looks insane also love the keyboard love the accents as well very setups on Tik Tok inspired him to build his he's a setup for gaming editing and graphic design really really talented kid um he got his first setup in 2017 and he's been upgrading it since he built a setup using birthday money and work he built a setup with some help from his dad okay understandable you're 15 I love this aesthetic looking at it like this I love the double stack here I think you did a great job with this kind of Vibe here I also love the GOI Glide and the Nan leaves up the side I think it adds a really nice aesthetic also like you got you know dual chargers for both mice I think that's kind of elite and then I also love your PC aesthetic the keyboard mouse combo I love how it's like I think this is maybe a 75 kind of similar to mine got the frro love the accents love the the mouse too if I were looking at it just by itself I would probably rate this like an eight but knowing that he has cable management and everything as well like cable management is kind of bad in the setup uh i' probably go like a 7.5 but yeah oh yeah but I love this setup I love the Aesthetics I think the only thing that needs to be better is his cable management the next setup is by Ryan okay he's 17-year-old from Texas okay he's a CFA manager I don't even know what that means um it's previous setup was just an Xbox and a single monitor so he's kind of on the come up he's got a PC now um he built a setup from editing pictures plus videos for school and gaming cool that's cool cool job photography work and video work is awesome I built this first PC in June 202 to okay so he's kind of been upgrading since 2022 that's also I love the personality in the room as well he's inspired by seeing amazing setups online and wanted to replicate it awesome uh he built the setup using uh the money working as a CFA I've been slowly building this setup since I built my PC so he probably built his PC in June and he's been upgrading over time so looking at the setup as a whole I think he did a great job with the aesthetic the only thing I would say is maybe move this PC a little further back if you need longer cables then you know extend those cables but yeah I also love the p board on the left side I didn't talk much about this but I like how you stored everything here I like how you did like everything in the in the different jars and how you started hanging up stuff I think that's really cool also you know since he's a subscriber on YouTube he's definitely a winner you can see first place right there so if you subscribe on YouTube You're a winner um but yeah also the cable manager looks pretty good for what you got also love the backgrounds too I think you did a great job with that as well I would probably rate this like a like an eight honestly it's actually really well put together so the next setup is by Braden uh he's from Veron shees he currently mows Lawns okay his main games are 5m and rust his old setup was just an Xbox and a monitor so he's on the come up here he built the setup around a year ago I would say that the leg room is not enough in my opinion uh his mom and his dad helped me build this setup okay cool um took about 3 hours to build it all in total I plans on upgrading the PC specs in the future okay yeah definitely needed the one thing I'd really say about this setup is you don't really have much leg room but I honestly would have went legs instead of elra here just because you don't have a lot of room I would just say also go for his 60% to kind of save some more room but I definitely think taking the Alex short out putting two more legs and everything would be the goal here just because again like your PC overall not a bad setup I'd probably rate it a 6 out of 10 all right moving on to the next one Sicilian I hope I said your name right the cilian setup they are 13 years old from Dublin Ireland really clean all right let's take a look the main game is war zone 2 okay he built a setup a year ago a year and a half ago during Co okay W the room looks insanely nice uh setup took about 6 months to build okay W um his old setup was a PS4 and an old monitor so he's kind of upgraded a lot from there uh he built a setup using his birthday and Christmas money which is cool so he's kind of upgraded during birthdays Christmases and stuff that's awesome and then his dad helped him build the entire setup which I really like this space bar by the way that's really cool on this keyboard I mainly use my setup for school and gaming so um yeah the one thing I notied right off of the rip was there was no mouse pad right um just because I run a mouse pad business you know like that's the first thing I noticed I don't know if this applies to everybody but for some reason that's like the first thing I noticed when I walk into a setup I think mouse pad number one you got to get a mouse pad two I would say to mount this monitor on the wall since the stand has a really round like it's really round um and it kind of like blocks off your keyboard more I'd say if you can mount this to the wall I would mount it to the wall PC and the le le uh mini love it love this AIO the way you built it in here the black and white aesthetic very very clean uh you did a great job building your PC on top of that I love the the room and the shelves and everything and the aesthetic you got going on look really good for 13 this is an insane setup love the painted wall behind the monitor I think it adds so much more than you think cable management is great as well I also love how you did headphone hangers here on the right for both your headphones really clean keyboard and mouse combo really solid as well I love this setup I think it's it's really really clean like just the room the athetic everything so I would probably rate it an8 out of 10 all right the next setup is by scoop he's 25 years old from England okay okay um he's an active duty Air Force oh that's cool um he mainly uses a setup for streaming and editing so thank you for your service as well that's awesome that he streams and everything that's pretty cool uh he has a dual PC set up for streaming okay all right love to see it I started building my setup September 2020 dude I love how you have the Dual mouse pad this is cool bro uh taking about 2 and 1/2 years to build it all that's really cool uh I was inspired by gutsy M K and teur awesome um he'd like to get a fourth monitor um and upgrade his lighting a little bit more such an insane setup so much personality the double mouse pad with the keyboard tray that matches the desk is wild that's such a unique thing I've never seen anybody do the mini a mini version of my mouse pad of the same one and bought the same that's so sick in my opinion the only thing I would say for this is the cable management for sure you know it could be a little better I also love all the personality in the background the Lego Thor the Lego Hogwarts the the fridge all the paintings on the wall everything like this is just a really nice like aesthetically pleasing setup for sure so I'd probably rate it at 9.5 out of 10 I I really love the aesthetic and you get another point for me using both mouse pads I think that's so sick the next one is by Scott Scott is a 9-year-old out of Scotland okay okay he's a setup for watching YouTube and Discord we're getting a lot of 9-year-old setups now his old setup was a laptop and was super ugly okay so he's kind of like upgraded since then I started building a setup in December 202 too built the setup using his birthday money that's pretty that's a that's a w his parents helped me build most of it that's cool I love the aesthetic man so there's not a whole lot to the setup honestly it looks really solid for what you have looks like a you got a pre-built there for a 9-year-old setup pretty freaking clean say probably a I'd probably say a seven yeah it's probably good but yeah I love this setup I think it looks really clean and the Aesthetics really nice for you know 9 years old this is Michael's setup I think this is the last setup of the day I'm 15 years old from tarnell Poland okay he's in middle school and he plays Cod and Valor as his main games um his old setup was an Xbox One S and a TV okay that's kind of a huge update though um he started building his setup uh in the 2020 during Co okay that's kind of a w um he's inspired by gutsy and heur I used my setup mainly for school and gaming okay built a setup by doing chores and birthday money okay yeah it looks pretty clean I love the the shelves the the all the boxes you're using the Lego baby Yoda um all the personality there as well K management honestly pretty solid gaming PC could use some work Intel stock fan could use some work for sure also love the wallpapers and all the foam you put around it I think it adds such a nice like aesthetic as well I think personally I'd probably rate it I'm going to go an eight no I'm going to go a seven seven out of 10 I think it looks good this is Adam a 14-year-old student out of Ireland his main game is Rainbow Six Siege and cod Modern Warfare 2 previous setup was just a PS4 and a TV what inspired him to build his current setup is Vermax me and Tech Source so thank you for that he built a setup for gaming watching videos and he built the setup in Christmas 2022 it took him around a year and a half to build it all he afforded it set up by birthdays Christmases and working around the house so look at out it I mean the pictures aren't the best so I'm going to go with my gut here and kind of just go with what I have it's honestly not bad I think the biggest thing it's very chill run- the-middle setup and I do like that you've got like the figurines and you're starting to build the personality like I can tell like you like Marvel and uh Spider-Man then you like you know Star Wars and stuff like that I think the little Lego guy is kind of cute but yeah I think overall it's super clean kill management is not bad could be a little better but you know what you did what you could P that Graphics card's got to go I don't know how that thing's alive and how you're running three monitors off that GPU I don't know how you're doing it I I just don't so yeah the main thing I would invest in is a new GPU 100% overall the setup's not bad the personality is decent K manion's decent as well and I'd probably rate this a solid seven out of 10 this is Eric an 18-year-old out of Kansas his main game is Apex Legends and his previous setup was just a corner desk with one Monitor and a PS4 but inspired him to build this current setup now is watching Esports players play in their setups and the Simplicity of optimum Tech setup he built this setup for schoolwork streaming and GTA with friends he started building the setup in 2021 did most of it in 2022 and then did the final upgrades in 2023 it took him around 3 years total to build this entire setup he afforded this setup through earning money by working on his grandmother's Farm working at a dog boarding Ranch and his graduation money he got the PC with his college account his grandmother set up do people actually play like this there's no shot right I mean c management is great the foundation isn't bad star Forge PC so oh this is the first time I've seen one okay this is definitely a typical asmin gold viewer look at bro's keyboard layout yeah bro that that's crazy you definitely should buy a rug I mean it's not a it's not a bad setup I think you do need to add more personality I I would honestly take down these Foams they ain't doing so yeah I would take them down I'd put something better on the walls maybe some more you know some more posters stuff like that but the monitor is crazy I mean me personally I don't I would never play this way I think the the mic would have been better maybe above the monitor like right here like somewhere right here put the this further back and then put it over the top of the monitor overall I'd probably rate this a solid uh a Solid 5 out of 10 next up is Gabe a 15-year-old student out of Washington his main games are fortnite and Rocket league and his previous setup was just an Xbox and so he's kind of upgraded a lot since then what inspired him to build his current setup is to play with his brother and he built the setup for his PC he built the setup in 2023 and it took him around 2 months to build everything here he also afforded this setup by working hard looking at this setup I mean it's pretty clean you know I actually like the the 18x 16 Miami swirl I think it fits so well in this setup nice a really nice monitor also I I think it's like more of like an Esports ready type of setup you know honestly I really like it I think the only thing so one thing that's holding the setup back I think is personality I mean if you look at the whole setup I feel like there's not a whole lot going on I think it's just like very runof-the-mill but it's also very clean too so it's not it's not like he did a bad job it's more like he just needs to add to it and that'll come with time but overall I think the the aesthetic like the the color aesthetic you're going for good I would keep on this path you're on overall I really like it the thing you know you could Mount this PO ship I don't know how big that is so I don't know if that's even mountable but I would try to at least clean up the cables a little bit maybe go down the leg or something like that and over but overall it's not bad yeah he definitely should have uh invested most of the money into the setup stuff like you know um like in the PC the monitor the peripherals like get that exactly where you want and then improve the Aesthetics to it as well maybe a second monitor could help a monitor mount too the desk that's one thick gas power break that's what I'm saying that thing's probably going to power him on for a week and a half if it goes offline but um I give this is probably a solid 6.5 I think it I mean it's not like crazy but it's also really nice some mouse pads in the setups in this video are my own company guts.com so if you like what you see check out in the description down below and let's get back to the video next up is Ralph a 12-year-old from Virginia his main game is fortnite his previous setup Was An Old Brown desk a Nintendo switch and a small small TV so he's upgraded a lot since then what inspired to build his current setup is Tech Source me and low he built the setup for gaming and maybe consecration in the future he built the setup for gaming and maybe consecration in the future he started building the setup in May and it's taken him around 3 or 4 months now to build this setup he afforded this setup by doing chores around the house and helping his family and his dad also helped him build the setup so that he wouldn't break anything in the process so looking at the whole setup I mean the the wies got to get some help for sure it's an Xbox setup so I didn't really expect much I was kind of looking for the PC if I'm honest it's not bad for a console setup I think the set the desk fits this console setup very well but if you were to upgrade to a PC it's probably not going to be you might need a bigger desk if you want to upgrade to your PC cuz like you might be able to fit one here but it might be like kind of tough keyboard and mouse is nice budget one the speakers are kind of cool looking instead of putting the the power strip here I would have ran one cable up and then mounted it on the bottom of the desk instead instead of here and yeah overall it's not bad um I just think it needs a little bit more organization of cables so looking at this though I mean the personality is there like a lot of figurines across the whole desk and setup uh plants there you know a lot of aesthetic there the clock on the wall with the little Spider-Man guy yeah I'd R probably a a solid I'm going to go solid six actually I'm going to go solid six out of 10 this is Raphael a 13-year-old out of Montreal Canada and his main games are CSO and Forza Horizon 5 his previous setup was just a PS4 so it looks like he's upgraded a lot since then already but inspired into build this current setup is me and Tech Source he built the setup for gaming and to live his passions he started building this setup at the very beginning of Corona virus damn long time ago this setup took him around 2 years to finalize his dream setup he afforded this gaming setup with his party money and the money he makes by cutting grass and who helped him build this setup is his dad ooh coming off of a coming off of a like a low-key setup to a banger look at that okay I do actually like the aesthetic of having like things that you do on the walls I've seen a lot of people who like you know like this is really chill to me I think this is cool in my opinion I really like the aesthetic he's going for like kind of encapsulating the monitors with the the skateboards and then you know the bonsai tree over here I think that's cool with the light and the mic placement is good good personality yeah you got a little race Sim below when he wants to use it that's pretty cool too PC looks clean I think that's really really dope and the whole room looks like a Vibe it looks like a Vibe dude the little Bing bag in in the in the corner I think it's actually not bad and then also I like how like you kind of scattered the personality throughout I think you did a great job with your aesthetic and what you're going for kale man's not bad also I would have recommended maybe putting a Raceway in front of this um but looking at the setup on the front I love how you did like the little light bar up top Solid I would say this like a solid eight next up is TJ a 15-year-old out of New York his main games are valerant and fortnite and he's a student and he also plays basketball his previous setup was a really tacky and cluttered setup and now it's getting better and who inspired to build his current setup is his brother which is really cool I think he started building the setup around 2 to 3 years ago and it's taken him around 6 months to a year to build it all now and he afforded the setup by working a job and also his parents helped him from time to time take a look [Music] oo I mean hey there's a lot of Personality it's not necessarily in the setup it's more it's more in the room like you can see in the far top right corner like there's a bunch of album covers and stuff like that that he maybe Drew or made and he's got like shoes and I'm assuming there's a shelf more on the other side of the room but the room looks really really clean from this angle also I think you did a great job with like just making it a really solid foundation two monitors PC keyboard mouse controller if you need it speaker if you need it you know very Rune Mill really clean very chill also I like that I saw I saw the $100 bill rug on the bottom dude um and this is his PC it's a little outdated for sure I don't know if this is supposed to be oh no it's a 1660 TI uh going back to the setup though I think it's dope I think he did a great job really love love the setup yeah overall I'd probably rate this a solid 7.5 out of 10 he's 14 and he's from the UK his main game is fortnite he was on Xbox One and an old TV before this and now he saved up for a PC and he afforded this by mowing his neighbors Lawns for a year and a half uh here's his main stuff he uses and he plans to get a high to mid-range PC in the future and sort out my cable management so looking at the setup I mean it's a laptop setup for sure I do like how you set up the laptop here I think this is very unique for sure having the monitor on the side and then the main monitor is better because it's like better herts or whatever this is pretty good but the cable management is really really bad on top of that this desk is a little scary like look at how you're balancing this like and then over here it's like way in the front like it's just thrown together and like I definitely would say to get a new countertop or try to fix this and make it look a little less like that it's funny that you spent money on the Nan lease when you need a PC you know I feel like those are expensive like I feel like those are things that come after unless you were gifted it but yeah interesting enough I mean the keyboard and mouse combo is not terrible completely honest I'll give it like a Solid 4 and a half I think the only thing that sets this setup apart from others is the way you mounted this monitors like the way you did your laptop and your monitors but everything else just needs work so I'd recommend I'd recommend doing that this is Astro setup he's a 15-year-old twitch streamer that also plays soccer and local Academy he's from Sweden uh his main game is sea of Thieves fortnite Minecraft and he built this setup to play video games study and have fun with his friends it took him around 3 years to save up uh working at his dad's place to reach the goal he built everything by himself except for the shelves that my dad helped me build and he used to play Xbox One S for 4 years until he switched and he wanted to spice up some stuff I really like the aesthetic you're going for I like that you put the GOI Glide above the shelves I like how you put the plants like kind of hiding the shelves and stuff like that also really like um the the PS5 controller stand I think that's really cool gaming PC if I'm completely honest I know you put on the floor cuz you thought you didn't have enough room but I think it would have looked better right here on the desk am I tripping to think that but oh why does it go like that um but I think it would looked better on the desk right there um looking at your modders and stuff really nice I like the lighting around the room too really clean heal mansion's okay I mean it's got a it's got a tray on it own so it's not a huge deal but yeah I think this PC on the desk would actually look pretty good maybe I'm tripping on that but I think it would look good there and I think you should also Mount get a Vivo Mount and mount your your monitor that way it's like floating um and then you won't have these bubbles in your in your mouse pad you know I think personality wise it's a solid seven setup itself wise I feel like there's a few things it could organize but overall this is really solid I I get you know what I'll give it I'll give it a 7.5 this is remedy setup he's a 13-year-old that is from from Florida he makes cool YouTube videos and FPS games and survival games interesting his main his main games he plays is valerant Minecraft Russ Call of Duty Black Ops 1 um he built a setup to have a nice time with his friends cousins and play video games okay it took him around 3 to four years to get everything after he got the laptop and he's been adding to it since here are some of the things he uses in his setup and he afforded the setup by collecting money for birthdays chores and getting stuff for Christmas dad and his brother helped him build his setup and yeah so looking at the setup I wish I would have seen more around the room I'm being completely honest with you yeah I would if I if I'm being completely honest I feel like there's a lot of stuff you can do with this setup I think you need monitor mounts for sure I think you need a bigger desk if possible like a thicker desk not just like this carbon fiber one and then I also recommend maybe putting your drawing tablet somewhere else problem is you have this drawing P tablet on the desk and it's not really useful you should make a thing where you just pull out the cable and you plug it in when you need it also cable management is kind of bad I would recommend some raceways as well but the drawing tablet's cool I just think you need some more room and you don't have not a lot of setup room to do this also um I think the mic placement is really bad as well um I'd recommend a boom arm if you can but there's zero personality in this to be fair what do you guys think chat 4 out of 10 a lot of people are saying four out of 10 I'm going to I'm going to give it a solid like there's really not a whole lot to go off of and I feel bad but I would probably give him I probably give him a solid I'm going to go a solid four this is Drake he's 13 and he got inspired by you and texor to build the setup he uses a setup for school work gaming and he plays fortnite Call of Duty rocket league and valerant and he raised money through Christmas money and his dad helped him build the setup love the pro Ron sticker shees dude he's got the he's got 34 out of 50 dude yo yo see this is an OG viewer of mine for show cuz I did this if you are a newer viewer to me that's okay but I did this in 2021 I went up to the warehouse and I signed like uh 50 mouse pads and I and I made them a gold colorway and that we've never released any of them ever again it's a it's literally one of a kind like there's there's literally and they're numbered I like the theme a lot I think the only thing you could really improve on here is just more personality in the setup but you're already doing such a good job here with like the shelves and the lights and the the the hoops right here and then your cable management scene's pretty decent from what I can tell extra points for being an OG for real I hey the streets are saying it's a 10 but in my opinion I I think it's like a solid eight this is Frank he's a 19-year-old uh college student from Puerto Rico his main games are valerant and Minecraft and he built the setup for gaming studying and the first time he submitted his setup was a year ago in episode 19 and now I'm here and upgrade it with my setup which took me a whole year and 2 months to build and he got his first PC 8 months ago okay awesome yeah but look at this man I mean this is beautiful I like the double monitor setup KO management is actually really nice really solid foundation love how you came manag behind the PC as well yeah really nice Cable Management I agree mic placement is good too monitor placement is decent mouse pad rooms great C man's very good so in my opinion","please put time stamps on your videos. i can't sift through 4 hours ever. thanks, from eveyrone.
Before I even watch the video I just wanted to say I'm final seriously saving up for my dream setup, I've always been really really bad with saving but I just can't go without a setup anymore. What really pushed me sadly is one of my long time friends who is also pretty broke just got their setup so I gotta get mine now too
14:35 we heard you the first time
Yo Wsg bro I just want to say you have inspired me so much and I love your channel bro,keep it up
Hope these kids know how lucky they are to have the opportunity to have such set ups.. I’m 25 next month and have never had the space where I’ve lived to have a set up like this, always been a console/tv player from my bed it’s been a dream for me to eventually get a set up like those shown. But I don’t think it will ever happen, it just seems so expensive to play games at a high quality. I have a ps5 and an xbox series x but don’t own a 4k tv
I’m not broke, I’m 13.
I have a few recommendations for your setup.If you have some extra money buy all OLED monitors because some of your monitors do not look the same and make it look distorted
27:22 you know what else is massive. THE LOW TAPER FADE!!!!!!!

You start the video by saying how you had a low grade setup and 50k later you are rating others low set ups. lol I'd rate the set ups based on comparison to yours before you had a 50k setup.

I have the 2002 monitor. Works like a charm.
First guy had a w setup
why does everyone hate on full-size keyboards so much. even for people who aren't accountants the num pad is so much easier to use than the line of numbers
Those cheap old HP monitors are goated. I used one of those for years back in the day when I was broke.
“It’s in pieces”
Bro violated him with that “why didn’t u rate mine ”
The third one plays pokemon
That full white one is nice and so is the one with gangar as the background
Bros beard is sort of a jumpscare.
The dude after the upside down Laptop has the same Monitor like me
“that monitor is from 2002” and it freaking rocks for how old it is. has decent picture quality even now. my fiancé has one and we share his computer as we both play bg3 (finally got a mac that runs it well) and it looks good
“This is proof that cheap setups can look good”

Damn bro
I can't be the only one that saw the Bill Cipher mouse pad.
He was spitting bars with the 6th one
“Idk if he plays fortnite or league of legends”
My guy that is a frigging gengar from pokemon
that monitor actually surprisingly has hdmi.
i've had one before, some models are from 2005-06 and they are some of the first monitors to support hdmi i believe.

i'm talking about the monitor behind carter in the beginning of the video.
That bill cypher mousepad goes hard
bro that 2002 two minter is the same one I use
I personally have grown up using a slightly higher sensitivity on my mouse. So I generally use a smaller mouse pad since I don’t move the mouse around much. It’s pretty useful to since my desk is smaller and I have big hands, so a bigger keyboard is nice.
PC 
In pieces ️
Bro literally rated that guys setup like dr Seuss.
Ayy we need more of these!!
rating caters shaving technique...
laptop, on my lap, me on the couch, mouse also on the couch. all I need
Mh setup mentioned
The last one was a bomb. But a fire Gaming setup. ️
Big fan of full size keyboards.
For the 2nd last one that’s not an rk61 it’s a redragon k630
Looking at setups 
Looking at Carter's beard
Bro hit the unc status
Woah that bill cipher desktop is so cool!
bro said rk61 when its a red dragon
Y’all ain’t ready for the Dell XPS with conpucessory brand office mouse
I have the same mousepad as the first person
4ra with Aaron Finch onboard means serious business his presence spells quality and trust
bro got no respect for the struggle
The bill cipher desktop mousepad is awesome. Where can I get one of those
Having an icon like Finch associated with 4ra makes every event feel premium and top notch
So nobody’s talking about his beard?
“Fortnite or league of legends” With a pokemon wallpaper
“It’s in pieces”, it’s also a Chromebook
“It’s in pieces ” lmao
the guy with the wavy mousepad setup looks really relaxing
""The monitor's from 2002, the pc doesnt have a gpu""️️️
petition for carter to do the snake thug
That 2002 monitor must've been monitor of the year because I know like 3 IRL people with that exact monitor and I infact had one myself
Where do we send them
Unpopular opinion a 6ft folding table with something to cover it is a fire desk
I have 3 of those 2002 monitors they are the fucking best dude for 1080p amazing
Upside down Laptop is crazy
Setup rating keeping you big as hell
I have that exact “2002” monitor runs beautifully
“Fortnite or league of legends” 
With the Pokémon wallpaper??
gng pulled out the genes for the ""the monitors from 2002 and pc doesnt have a gpu"" straight bars
The first PC is a Ibuypower premade PC and that’s the mouse and mouse pad that comes with the PC that’s why it is so small
The G213 is a underrated keyboard
“That monitor is from 2002 and the PC dosent have a GPU”
The upside down laptop
""why didnt you rate mine "" ️️ ""its in pieces""
