Rightnow, we have a 240 AIO from CoolerMaster, and we're going to see if we canjust go ahead and improve the coolingperformance without replacing the AIO.We can just change out the fans. We'regoing to run Cinebench against this andmake sure we can heat the CPU up and seewhat kind of cooling the stock fansactually offer. We're using hardwareinfo 64 so we can check the temperaturesof this current AIO setup. And thenwe're going to replace the fans and seeif that actually improves the cooling.You can also see in the task managerthat we are running at 100% utilization.The PC only had two intake fans, so weswapped those out for the Tikkimus one,and that was 4C alone. We had a max tempof 77C, and it's bouncing around from 73to 74C. Now, we're going to shut downthe PC and install the new fans.The CFM on these Tigas fans isabsolutely impressive. So, afterinstalling the new fans, we ranCinebench for another 10 minutes just tocross reference the temperaturedifferences, and the max temperature wasabout 69C, and we're bouncing aroundfrom about 66 to 69. If you don't wantto replace your current cooler, new fansmight actually do the trick because wegained about 10 C just from swapping outthe fans and keeping the same AIO.","Top should be exaust if its a cooler and needs a intake or exaust fan on the back to truly help it

I myself run the fans on the front with my rad and it intakes. Mounted by 3 other fans so 6 in total for my front radiator. 2 big fans intake on top on mine and back is exaust. Very tall case fits 3 fans in a row.
Very interesting video, keep up the good work, 73° to 68° is not much difference but it can reduce fan speed by a little amount improving the life span of the fans.
Was considering swapping my fans out for thermalright ones since I like their LEDs on the fans that came with my AIO that I just swapped in but I think I might hold on that bc I wanna get that N-ATX case and turn my current PC into a streaming PC.
What brand of fans did you use? And what’s the cost to performance vs Noctua or other brands
Why are your top fans running as intake
You forgot to mention the decibel difference
Underrated
and no side panel
Nah, 73-74 down to 68-69 in a synthetic workload and the min Idol temperatures were the same. not worth the cost changing them out. rarely do home users run their CPU at 100% for any extended period of time. Tecs and YouTubers seem to forget that people aren't running synthetics all day like they are. When your CPU is running 50% in a game the only difference between these two fans is where they're going to be on their fan curves and whether or not that amounts to more or less noise depends on the fan. They are good looking fans though but not worth the money because they perform better in synthetics

Theres no reason to use anything except for noctua

And here's why.I built the PC with an RX970. And then Ibought this new PC with an RX 9700 XT.And this graphics card is a beast with20 GB of VRAM. So, I just want to takethis graphics card and put it into myold or my new gaming PC. Would you havekept the RX970 or would you haveswitched it with this RX9700 XT?Parked up outside in a old","9070 for gaming just because they’re similar but you get fsr4. 7900 XT if you’re using AI or Video editing. You really won’t need that extra 4GB unless you’re 4K gaming. My 5090 doesn’t even go over 16-18GB vram util while gaming triple AAA titles in native 4k.
9070 is hopefully ganna get the glow up the 7900xtx had since launch
i would say look up a video on youtube comparing the 9070 to the 7900XT to see which one performs better
Definetly the RX 9070 XT man that thing is a beast for the price
Love the vids, you're saying 9700xt. But its a 7900xt
110% stick with the 9070 over the 7900xt, even over the 7900xtx. for 2 reasons, 1) comparable for most tasks already, and much more energy efficient. 2) besides the fsr4 and other upgrades to the architecture, every 9700 can be flashed with a 9070xt bios and when it comes time for that little bit more, you get it, warranty will be out anyway
Should keept the 9070 looked way cooler
I would switch to rx 7900 xt
Keep both
I would sell both and just get a RTX 5070ti.
Why are idiots saying to get 7900xt?
16gb is more than whay you need
9070 has FSR 4,better frame gen,more efficient,better in every way and performs better but theres idiots that think more vram makes a gpu better
I want your old gpu but I know I'll never get it
9070 xt, but would get 7900 xtx instead.
Pass from rtx 3080ti to 7900xt cant be happyer all games i play on ultra/epic settings native 1440p overkill of vram alows me comfor for gaming i always wanted..yeah ofc i will go for 4080ti or 4090 if i have money sure if u have lil bit less and u want best posible expirience look no further,great vid
Mine got damaged like 6 months ago and I can’t buy another one I had a rtx 3060
keep the 9070 it's worth it just because of FSR 4
also you can get the 9070 XT bios and get better performance (didn't test it out, just saw that people are doing it)
What case fans do you use on the black build ?
9070… would have gone XT… not the 7900XT. It’s missing FSR4.
If it isn’t Nvidia then it genuinely doesn’t matter lol
I would have switched it. I care more about real performance than the better rt from the 9070
The 7900 xtx is better listen so the Rx 9070 Xt bets the Rx 7900xtx but not the regular Rx 9070 so it good move
fsr4 dont have rival in AMD. 16gb is enough for everything. Dont buy asus, buy xfx mercury rx9070xt. Is the best brand for this gpu
just so other ppl know vram isnt everything
nah keep the 9070
I would personally stay with the 9070, although the 7900xt has slightly better rasterized performance but the 9070 does have better Ray Tracing capabilities and upscaling
7900 xt is close to 9070 xt i think, id take The 7900xt for The 4 extra gb
I prefer rx 9070 xt just cuz it has better rt performance and fsr 4
Just use the new one
what case is the black one?
Can i get the one you dont use? ill sub, like and turn notifications on ( plzz)
So you didn’t build your dream gaming pc?

So for context, this used to bemy older brother's room. The problem ismy brother moved out a decade ago. Andsince then, we've just been using thisroom to pile up all of our junk. Andbecause my room has no more space for agaming setup, especially with my gamingsetup taking up all that space, Ifigured I'd just build my second gamingsetup in here. And as you guys may havealready seen, this room needs a lot ofwork. So before we do anything else, weneed to clean this room. And then I'llshow you guys my vision.[Music]Okay, so the room already looks a lotbetter and all the clothes are picked upand put in laundry baskets. So now thereal work starts. So basically my p Sobasically my plan So basically my planYou know what? Let me just show you guysthe vision. Okay, so as you guys cansee, this is the area that we're workingwith. I'm going to be taking this TVstand and sliding it a little bit closerto the left. And this whole area righthere is going to be cleared out. Yeah.I'm going to take these two toy boxesand put them in the closet. And thenthis little like nightstand right here.I'm going to be taking this putting itover here and then putting the printeron top of the nightstand. So, like Isaid, we got a lot to work with. Butbetter late than never.[Music]Bro, genuinely only one might genuinelyonly one might fit in here. Bro, I don'tknow if I'll be able to put them both inhere.Okay.Okay.Y'all didn't see that.[Music]Okay, this mouse pad got to go. Thiskind of looks ugly.Okay, printerplugged in.Boom. This already looks a lot better.I'm going to move these eventually, soignore the clothes. But first, I justwant to focus on the setup. Nightstandover here. Junk in there. Closet's stillfully accessaccessible. Okay. Well, now we're justmaking clutter. So, this whole area iscleared out. And now I'm going to bemoving this uh nightstand a littlefurther to the left to see if I'll haveroom. And a lot of you might be askingthe games. Room for what? Room for thedesk. Okay, so I've officially cleanedup the entire room. I haven't cleaned upthe little mess that was underneath thenightstand. So, now we're going to betalking about today's partner, FlexisSpot. So, now that I'm done witheverything else, it's finally time tostart building the actual setup. And thefirst and probably most important thingfor the setup is the desk, which isexactly where Flexis Spot comes in, thepartner of today's video. This mighttake a while, so let's get started.[Music]So, for my desk, I decided to go withFlexis Spot because I've been seeingtheir desks all over social media. Theylook great for what my setup trulyneeds. The color I went with is thebamboo top and the white frame to matchthe room and to match the theme that I'mgoing with, which stay tuned becauseit'll be revealed soon. So, this is theFlexis Spot E6 dual monitor desk. Whatmakes this desk the perfect fit is thefact that it can lift up to 333 lbs. Andyeah, I mean lift, not hold, becausethis desk is a desk that can rise up anddown depending on whatever mood you'rein.Yo, this is actually kind of scary.We're going back down.Dude, this is actually so cool. So, ifyou're in a more productive mood and youfeel like standing up while doing yourwork, you can do that. If you want tosit really low to the ground forwhatever reason, you can do that. Ipersonally think I'm going to be usingthe standing desk feature a lot becauseI love to stand up while I do my work,especially when I edit my videos. And itcan also withstand the lift of 355 lbsup to 20,000 times because of its 28,000PSI. And because it also comes withwheels, you can attach them and roll itaround your room if you do want tochange up the location of your setuppretty easy. But overall, this desk is avery good desk, and I probably wouldhave went with this first if I wouldhave known about it. This desk ishonestly a very good desk and the sizeof it is also very impressive. And to behonest, when I build more setups in thefuture, I'm probably going to go withFlexis Spot. And the best part is thatyou get a 10-year warranty on the deskand the motor and a 2-year warranty onthe control panel and the electronics.Anyways, I just want to say thank youFlexispot for partnering with me andallowing me to be able to do what I'mdoing currently. But let's get back tothe game. So, it's been 2 days since Ilast did anything to the setup. So,today we're going to be going to Targetand just other stores. And I'm justgoing to be looking for decorations.Keep in mind though that I already havea lot of decorations here. So, I'm notsure how many decorations I'll bebuying. But if there's one thing I knowfor a fact I'm gonna need to get is somefake plants and a MacBook stand becausethis setup will be powered by my MacBookfor now. So I'll get dressed with me togo to Target and other storespotentially like I just said. Okay,let's go. Okay, so I'm not going to lie.I'm already wearing some pretty niceshorts, so I'm just going to try to finda shirt to go with the shorts. Honestly,I'm probably just going to go with thismessy jersey. I don't really have a lotof nice shirts right now. And the shirtthat I was just wearing isn't likereally cropped, so it looks weird. Andthen for jewelry, I'm going to go withthis little cross. Okay, hear me out.So, for the shoes, I'm going with theseum Nikeretro. But, like I said before, it'stime to go to Target. So, let's freakinggo. Also, I'm probably not going to uhtalk in Target because I'm still notcomfortable with recording in publicyet, but I will talk to you guys once Iactually get into the store potentially.So, let's go.>> Okay, so it's officially been a daysince I went to Target and got all thesupplies. So now it's finally time tostart building the actual setup. I thinkthe first thing on the list shoulddefinitely be the monitor. So we'regoing to start with that.[Music][Applause][Music]>> Okay, so I just put the monitor on andput the MacBook down. And I'm not goingto lie, this looks so good already. Ihaven't even added anything. And nowthat I'm done with all that, I've got toput all the peripherals on and connectthe monitor to the MacBook. So that'swhat work. So that's what we're going tobe doing next. So like I said before, Iwant this setup to be more cozy andaesthetic versus my gaming setup is justRGB all in your face 24/7. So I decidedto go with this mouse pad, but I mightchange it in the future. Probably will.But I found the solution because thiskeyboard literally matches this mousepad. Like there's not another keyboardout there that matches this mouse pad asgood as this one. So it worked out. Likeliterally look at this. You have theblue, you have the white, and you havethe gray. Wo! Kind of. Yeah, this isperfect. For the mouse, I've chose thislittle row cap mouse because I feel likeout of all the mouses, because out ofall the mouses I have, this one feelsthe greatest in terms of comfortability.And because it goes out on the sides alittle bit more, it'll be a lot morecomfortable for me when I'm editing onthis setup and even when I want to playgames that are more chilled instead ofcompetitors. So, it's been a couplehours since I last talked to you guys.And the reason is because I thought Ihad an adapter to connect the monitor tothe Mac, but unfortunately, I couldn'tfind it. But now that I'm back, as youguys can see, I was able to successfullyconnect the monitor to the MacBook. I'mnot going to lie, I don't really likethis mouse because it keeps changingcolors and it's like really ugly. I likethe design of the mouse, but I don'tlike the RGB. So, I'm going to changethat right quick. Unfortunate update. Icouldn't find another mouse. So, now I'mstuck with this ugly mouse until I buy anew one. And trust me, I will be buyinga new one. But moving on from that, nowthat I have all the peripherals and themonitor set up, it's finally time tostart adding the decorations. So, forthose of you who remember when Iactually went to Target and bought abunch of decorations, I got a fake plantand then I got a really cool lamp. So,I'm going to be adding those as well assome other things that I just don't usefor my main gaming setup. Unboxing time.start the clip. Don't Don't add that in.All right, so welcome to the gamesTarget unboxing.First up, we have this beautiful plant.And I don't think I showed you guys thesecond thing, but I got this really coollooking lamp. I wanted this setup to bemore like aesthetic and cozy. So, Iwanted to get something cozy. This isdefinitely cozy. All right, so I'mthinking I want to put this right here.And because the cables are going to beshowing on this side, I'm going to putthis right here. Oh my gosh, I'mcooking.[Music][Music]Not going to lie, I thought the lamp wasgoing to be brighter, but I like thatit's not brighter. Like, let me turn offthese lights. Oh, yeah. That's Yo,that's actually so cozy. I better notsee any comments saying, ""Where did thegames go?"" That's not That's not That'snot funny. All right, I think now I needto change the wallpaper. All right, so Ialso got this monitor light bar, and Idon't really use it in my setup thatmuch because I don't have enough roomfor it. So, I figured why not put it inhere. Yo, the plant strap, the plantmight have been the strat. It's coveringup every cable. No, man. Boom. Yep. Welike it. We like it. We love You love tosee it. Yeah, that looks so nice. Allright, I'm going to go see if I can findanything else to add to this room. Idon't know if you guys see the vision ornot, but you see this? You notice howthis is orange and yellow and this isyellow. So, what if what if I take thislight and put it behind the plant togive the plant more of a glow? You knowwhat I mean? All right, we're going totry right now. I don't know. It lookskind of tacky. I feel like if it wasjust like a underglow, it'd be better,but it's like I don't know. I'm going tolet you guys decide in the comments. Ifyou guys like the vibe, let me know. Andif I see a comment with a good amount oflikes on it, I'll keep it. Now that Ihave everything set up, it's finallytime to But now that I have everythingset up, it's finally time to do the It'stime for the montage. Yeah, that's whatit's called. Let's run the montage.Before I run the montage, though, I dowant to say thank you guys for all thesupport you guys have been giving me.I'm honestly going to give it an eightjust because there's no PC, but I likethe vibes and I like the theme that it'sgoing for. But thank you guys forwatching. Remember that Jesus loves youand we out.[Music]Yeah. Do it for the love, for the hate,for the sons and the faith. for thedrums and the baseless break. Somethingto make for the ones in the basementchasing the one to scrape. Hugs and thethanks. Not the funds in the bank.","aura thumbnail big dawg

Well, Ed. Yeah, go. Just goahead.Well, this is the closest thing. So,this is the new desk with the oldmodified frame.Ah,so this is desk one of five from thefirst run.Oh, so this is this is sellable. Yeah,this is a production sellable desk onthis frame right here. We're we'resourcing new frames.Okay, these frames are the frames fromour first batch of desks. We did desk1.0. And I believe we have like 150 ofthese in stock still. Something likethat.Yeah,these are very, very, very expensiveframes. One of the reasons we'reswitching suppliers is these frames areextremely expensive. The downside is ifwe do if you do get one of the old deskframes, if you're one of the earlybackers with the desk, it will notsupportthe returna return L desk. It's just going to bestandard and XL.What is Oh, what is this?So, those are the controllers. The onlyissue we ran into was we didn't leaveourselves enough room here for it tofit. So, on the on the current desk, youhave a left and a right mounting spotfor it. So, if we went with this supersimple thing, we would still again liketwo inserts here or two inserts here andyou could have it, you know, on yourleft or on your right and it gets downfar enough to get out of the way of thehinge and everything.If we did this, does it still havetilting capability?Yeah, that's why we had to do it becauseonce you start to tilt it the desk up,it hits into the combi core that doesn'tmovecuz the obvious thing is just mount.That problem is you're too far recessed.You can't really you you can stillaccess it, but because there's a adigital controller there, you need tostill be able to see the output of it'sreally hard to see that unless you'redown pretty much like at eye level.That one is magnet mounted.Yeah, that is kind of nice. This is onlygoing to be an issuefor the first 150.For the first 150.Yeah,just make150 of this like this bracket. I thinkthat's the play. So, yeah. Okay. So, I'mgoing to give the green light for forthe first 150 desks. Special Edmanufactured oneoff. Okay, Ed, take usto the next item.All right. You wanted dovetailedcubbies.Oh, dovetailed cubbies.And then I gave you lots of dooroptions. We didn't know which way wewanted the handle to go. And then I diddifferent grain orientations.Okay. Initially, we're going to launchthese with drawers, not the doors, butI'm fine looking at the doors from sortof a prototype perspective. So, what wegot here, come in here. These aredovetails.Do you know what dove do you know howdovetails work?Josh, explain the dovetail.Uh, well, you have one side has a pinand the other side has like a flared uhwooden joint, your pin, fits in betweenyour dovetail, and it can't pull itselfout because it's locked into place.Dovetails.Yeah.Ding.Now, this is very interesting. Get anice shot of this. We've got verticalgrain orientation on the door andhorizontal grain orientation on thedoor. Ho ho ho. Johan,are you vertical boy or are you ahorizontal man?I definitely prefer the horizontal.Wow. I agree. I think the horizontalI think the horizontal is better. Ithink that is more attractive. Now, interms of the pole, this is interesting.I think you [ __ ] nailed it. I thinkyou nailed it with this. I think Ed gotit. Horizontal grain,vertical pull on the tall, horizontalgrain, horizontal pull on the short. Iactually think we actually am I crazy?I think that the handle should go thesame direction.[Music]Let's continue the adventure. didn't waswaiting for wood. So, I madeOh my gosh,beautiful. Fastest floor.And then it's got track at the top soyou can put your cubbies up in it. I'mmaking brackets to hold it on, butagain, I don't know if we really cared.Anyway, I have this size so that whenthe desk is at its highest, it's under 8ft. It only goes to 90 instead of 90.You hate that. Yeah, I was just going tosayI IYou like Krabby Patties, don't you,Squidward?There's elements of genius here. So, thethe reason there's genius is I do lovegetting this tea track up there. I'm notin love with the aesthetics of it. We'regetting real big. We're getting realheavy. And so I got a little bit ofconcern for like the the sit stand.We're within rangecareful. But I do like the fact that youhave tara up here. I could see peoplecoming in and putting cameras, puttingmicrophones, putting lights, right?That's the power of the tara being uphere is I'm thinking of like thestreamer. The thing is we've got likethis [ __ ] Tim Allen tool timeaesthetic.All of that will just beYeah. If really what we're trying to dois say, hey, we're trying to get Tarasuspendedstably at that height, what is sort ofthe lightest weight way to do that? Likewhat is the cleanest, easiest way to dothat?I would just try to get the genius ofthe idea and try to reimagine the form.Instead of having a big panel here, ifthere was say one or two boards,cross panels,like cross boards, you couldtheoretically also make it so this cuzwhat people would do is they would mountthat to the back nowadays.Yeah.Okay, cool. So, where we're at, I thinkthis guy has no significant changes. Iwould like to get this to a formalone-off. This is the same as this. Yep.Cable management. So, do we have anynotes for cable management? Mhm. So,yeah, put that. Does that seem good,Kelly?Yep.We're going to have the desks at Gen Confor sale. I'd like to get just the deskson the on the website for sale thismonth. I don't know if we can do it.It's going to be close.Try.Cable management, PC mount, cubby, andkeyboard drawer. I think those are thebasics. Those are the things I want toget locked down, get built, like getthem into production, get them on thewebsite ASAP.All right, cool. Thank you. We're good.Any other questions, comments, concerns?What's the dress code for Gen Con? Idon't have a lot of fancy stuff.Dress code for Gen Con is you do you arethe only suit I have is splattered withblood.Yeah. You know, um Knock out.","Ed’s desk topping shelf has big “90s computer room” energy. 

Embrace it with a retro line available in golden oak and super yellowy walnut!
Love how within the span of 5 minutes I went from ""oh, not sure I'd want to be part of the first 150 due to the old desk legs"" to ""oooo custom rare Ed mount, only 150 made""
""Is anyone else injured?"" ""I got some sunburn..."" 
I have a feeling that even if Crazy Ed bought a new suit, it would be covered in blood by Sunday anyway. May as well wear the one you have.
Let Ed be Ed at GenCon
“ You rang “
Crazy Ed's Gencon attire is a Tshirt with a QR code. To what? Only Ed will know until people start scanning it
for the doors I'd want it hinged on the right so that the opening is toward me while I am sitting there.
Doug won the battle against the teenagers, but he lost the war to age...
Definitely with Crazy Ed on the vertical panelling for the doors being nicer...
Looking forward to see Ed and the Desks at GenCon
How do you say ""Dovetails"" without doing the ""Ducktales WOOHOO""
I'm so gonna get Crazy Ed to sign my WyrmLyfe shield that has his stamp on it!
Crazy Ed is a god damn genius.
I have an L-desk with a big back like that, I love the thing. It's getting old and could do with a replacement [Some parts are fancied up particle board], I'd get a Wyrmwood desk with a back like that. Don't even need the sit/stand hardware, gimmie some solid wood legs.
I think Doug was right about the weight issue. It's not just the weight of the top cabinet itself; you have to think about all the random stuff people will put into it.

Why not also have T Track on the backboard?
I swear to god if you don’t let Crazy Ed wear whatever he wants I’m gonna lose it.
Ooh now you have that whole cubby with the T-track above the desks. Just get rid of the sit/stand and put 4 normal nice legs on the desk and you might actually be able to sell some desks
I’m not sure why it said vertical boy. I definitely like the horizontal grain doors and backs better but…. I’ll bring the blood suit in hopes they let me wear it at least one day. I’m not sure the airlines will allow my spiked top hat though
I'm glad you have the pc mount, cable management is super important, I like the idea of over head t-track but I think Doug is right it should be two cross bords to mount other things to instead of a solid panel. I would look at compatability with Vasa wall mounts and arms
Handles on the doors should go the same orientation, regardless of tall or short cupboard. Don't care which way, but pick one!
There's a part of me that wants aag rack on the back of the top desk thing. I'd make all my stationary organizers mad rack compatible
I'm dedicating this to Crazy Ed's sunburn
Can you show a side by side that has Jason's initial vision with what the desk has become?
Let go Crazy Ed!!!
Dovetails... woo-oo
That reveal at 5:09 tho, what showmanship
So when i was inquiring wirh customer service, i was informed as someone who had already placed an order. The order would take 4 months, so sometime in September to get one of the new desks due to the base being out 4 months
LMAO

""carbon fiber""
Is the desk too crazy? Absolutely not! It's exactly what your desks needed - more options and more modularity!

PS - sorry about your foot woes, Johann.
I think crazy ed splattered blood suit at gencon would be awesome
I think a wall mounted shelf that has the underside T-track is more practical and desirable. You could put it anywhere in the office too and have another adjacent product line that uses the same cubbies
You missed the opportunity to go “Dovetails Oh Woohoo” in the Ducktales theme
I love horizontal grain, but that makes me want continuous grain across the doors…
Honestly? I really kinda like the big, classic office desk hutch vibe. As long as it didn’t add too much extra cost, I’d probably add it on myself.
The lines on the hutch are not appropriate for the desk style. Get rid of the curves and make the edge thickness at least appear similar to the desk. Maybe even complete with a mag track. Otherwise, I love the idea of a hutch that can be mounted to in the top and the back.
He can get the comments, when he puts feetpicks on the internet.
You should be making a Danish style modular shelving system. Just think of all the possibilities and customization. It could integrate with both the desks and its cubbies/cabinets all of the gaming table accessories. I can think of 100 Ideas and integrated setups, it could be the solution to so many things.
Desk is just the right about of crazy, especially since the desk hood can be an add-on.
does the keyboard drawer work while the desk is tilted?
the back board or low back board would be an issue for the Screen monitor arms that alot of people use that clamps to the edge of the desk but the rest looks great
love the desk
Use Aluminum Quad-T extrusion for the posts, some sort of web mesh / extrusion rails on the sides and back for rigidity, use part of a desk top with the magnet rail and T track as the TOP of the hutch, and have some 'clip in' wood covers to help blend it all together. T Track mounted lights would be cool there too for people who stream and such...
Vertical gal, here. And I hope Johann’s foot heals quickly!
I know this newer format is better for you guys, and more product focused, but boy do I miss the daily vlogs.
MOAR DESK!
6:33 the handles being centered on the door and being at different heights just looks sooooo uggos
Asking for Johann foot love is crazy!
I would prefer to have a floating shelf with the T track above my monitor, rather than having that whole clunky top thing. That would keep it sleek and sexy.
8:45 what? No magnetic rail at the top of the backboard??
The desk is not crazy enough yet
Desk Topping shelf for the win
Save Johann's feet! Save Doug's knees! Vertical grain all daaaaaay.
Vertical > Horizontal
How about a resolute sytle desk with the eagle being a dragon, each pannel has a different D&D style character (wizard, owl bear, warrior). The inbetween design can be axes, arrows, fire, bows and spears.
Yeah... just look at the Magnus Pro XL and the Corsair desk and see how they mounted their pegboards and monitor mounts and T rails and stuff. Build like that. Metalwork is fine, and you could always have wood to cover over it if you really wanted to be precious about it. You want your structure to be light and thin? Use metal and disguise it with wood. It's not like the desk doesn't have metal legs. Offer a metal version, offer a wood sheathe for it.
Honestly, love the hutch design.
Dovetails? Woo-oo.
Cat Tower Please!! Would love to see what you guys can come up with. I am sick of how ugly/awkward most cat towers are.
Please look into a computer desk which doesn't have the sit/stand legs and doesn't tilt. I'm a basic bitch and only want a normy computer desk.
Gute Besserung Johann
For once I agree with Doug, aim it at the streamer, gamer, utilitarian
Wall mount PC on the Backboard? rather than Monitor on backboard, with monitor from T-track or triple monitor on backboard?
I think the desk is coming along great and if I wasn't such a broke ass then I would be buying one. I do really like the idea of the T- track up high and a surface to mount your computer monitors to is a great idea and another way to hide the cable management.
There are no cool kis at the church picnic
Where Jason be at with the design of these?
i think your getting into scope creep with these desks just adding and adding and adding. it all looks amazing but also gotta stop at some point to sell a product lolz
...Cat/Dice Towers?
Vertical gang
Can we get foot pics of Johann's injured foot so we can send his foot some love? Asking for a friend.
I still want an L option
Why does Doug keep trying to impart religion in his household when he is clearly not a christian person? Maybe he wants to have even more conflicts with his kids when they become adults...
How long is the return?
yeah seems like it might be heading towards too crazy.
Serious question: Does Johann speak german with the amish and do they have good bread (for a german )?
yes
Can haz moar cat furniture pleaze.
I vote BLOOD SUIT!!!
Johann foot love? Didn’t think it was that kind of channel but OK.
Who even uses a keyboard drawer now a days? Just a waste of space and a knee knocker.
Great work showing Bobbie less and getting Doug to say less dumb things.
Not a fan of the over cabinet - looks old fashion
I'm dedicating this comment to Doug's knee
vertical better ;)
You all have come full circle. You were a niche wood game accessory company that bought a custom huge skew furniture company; and in the subsequent years you have built more and more skews with wide spectrum on customizable furniture….the desk is too much and you all get bogged down in features that make it impossible to fulfill.
just make a desk.. get rid of the lift and just make a desk
I'm dedicating this comment to Johann's feet ligaments

And in 2025, with thecurrent state of the economy being atall-time amazing, I have been wondering,what kind of a setup can you build withjust a $1,000 budget? And that isexactly what we're going to be buildingin this video. And then I'm going to besending this whole $1,000 gaming setupto one of you guys watching this video.More on that later in this video.Building a solid gaming PC that can runthe latest titles smoothly and under$1,000 gaming setup budget is kind ofhard. But don't worry, we managed to getit done for around $800. And it turnedout looking very aesthetically pleasing.And not to mention, it handled 1080p,1440p, and even some 4K gaming like achamp. So, let me introduce you to theparts that we used. For the brains ofthis PC, we ended up using an older CPUfrom AMD. the Ryzen 5 5600 6 core CPUthat comes with a Wraith cooler, which Iended up painting white costing around$129. And we paired that with theGigabit A520 and motherboard for just$73. Now, for the RAM, we have a white16 gig DDR4 RAM kit from TimeickPinnacle running at 3200 MHz, costing usonly $26. Storage-wise, we picked up anNVME 1 TB M.2 SSD for just $52. And forthe GPU, which is where most of thebudget went to, we have the brand newAMD 960 XT 16 gig GPU that cost me $390from Best Buy. And the reason why mostof the budget went for the GPU isbecause I personally play video gamesthat are more GPUbound than CPUbound.So, we invested more into the GPU andnot the CPU. And if you mainly playCPUbound games, usually I wouldrecommend going with a more powerful CPUand less powerful GPU. But for this PC,we went with the 960T XT. And to add alittle bit more aesthetic, I added thisAsia horse white sleeve cable extensionsfor $20. And to power all of this, weare using the 550 W MSI Mag A550 powersupply for just $56. And finally, forthe case that we are using, this is justa generic case that I found on Amazonfrom a brand called PC Cooler for $60.And it came with two pre-installed ARGBfans. And I ended up adding a coupleextra fans on the PC just to have betterair flow. But the final build turned outamazing. a clean, simple, wide gaming PCthat can run every game very smoothly.And to give you guys an idea of theperformance of this PC, in Fortnite withmedium to high settings, we were gettingover 200 FPS. In Call of Duty Black Ops6, we were getting around 140 FPS onmedium settings. And even in GTA withmedium to high settings, we were gettingaround 80 to 60 FPS, which is honestlyquite impressive for this budget,especially playing at a high settings.Now, believe it or not, the gamingmonitor that I was able to get to keepus under budget kind of soundsunbelievable. This is a 200Hz 1080p IPSgaming monitor with a 1 millisecondresponse time that I found on Amazon forjust $99, which is insanely good valuefor a gaming monitor for that price.You're basically getting two hertz onthe dollar, which is kind of unheard of.The bezel thickness is pretty good. Itis Vasa compatible, which means you canuse it on a monitor arm or a mole mount.It has freeync technology, butunfortunately it's not very adjustable.You can tilt it back and forth, but youcan't adjust the height. But honestly,for the budget of $99, the colors looksquite decent. The panels look good frommany angles and it played really welland it was buttery smooth like expectedat 200 hertz. Now, before I show you thekeyboard and mouse, we needed a mousepad. And I'm going to leave choosing amouse pad up to you since it's more of adesign preference, but you can find alot of good gaming mice between $10 and$20. I'm personally going to use onethat I already have since I already havelike five or six of them. I got thismouse pad for 20 bucks a while back andI honestly love the design because it'squite simple, white with a little bit ofdifferent designs, but it looks prettygood. Now, would you believe me if Itold you that the mouse I'm showing youright now only cost me $23 and it weighs43 gram? This is the Royal Clutch RK M30ultralight gaming mouse. It uses a PA3311 sensor and I can connect via 2.4gig wireless dongle as well as Bluetoothor the included braided cable. It has avery solid click and scroll wheel feeland a pretty decent slide. And it evenhas a DPI button on the bottom to adjustthe DPI on the fly. And for just $23that I paid for it, this mousedefinitely takes the cake. Now, for ourkeyboard, I found this $25 60%mechanical gaming keyboard from a brandcalled TMKB that has preloopstabilizers, doubleshot key caps, andlinear red switches that sound quitegood.[Applause]Even though this keyboard sounds reallygood, it has a couple of flaws. One ofthem is the switches are notinterchangeable, so you can't changethem to anything else. And the RGB isset to one color, which is this lightblue. You can change the RGB effect, butyou can't change the color. So, for just$25, I have no complaints about thiskeyboard, especially since I'm trying tofit it under a $1,000 gaming setup. Now,everybody and their mom has been talkingabout using IM for gaming. And I figuredI'd just try it out, especially sincethey're budget friendly. And I don'treally know much about IM or which onesare the best, but I found these IM onAmazon called CCZ Yo, and they had17,000 reviews at four and a half starscoming at only $19. These things lookpretty cool with a transparent designand honestly tuned really well. And whenI first put them on and startedlistening to music, I could not believethat these thing only cost 20 bucks. For20 bucks, these almost sound as good asmy AirPods, which cost $200. And withthat last 20 bucks, it brings our totalto around $1,000 for this whole gamingsetup. And this is the final result ofit.Now, like I said in the beginning ofthis video, I'm going to be sending thisentire gaming setup to one of you guyswatching right now. To enter for thisgaming setup, all you have to do is makesure you're subscribed to me, like thisvideo, and comment what is the firstvideo game that you're going to beplaying if you get this setup. It's alsogood to mention that multiple short formvideos of this video are going to beposted on my accounts on other socialmedia platforms where you can gain extraentries by entering on those videos aswell. With that said, I will choosesomebody in about a month from now. Bestof luck, my friends. And by the way,everything you just saw in the video islisted below in the description. Thankyou guys so much for watching and I hopeyou enjoyed watching this ultimate$1,000 gaming setup and I'll see youguys in the next video.[Music]","The last thing I owned & gamed on was a Playstation 2, so receiving a gaming monitor would be a dream come true CyberPunk seems like a good first game!
1:16 didn’t realize it’s called a redeon
Definitely would be playing some Clawed, ferocious, and other dinosaur survival horror games on this PC! Great video man!
The first game i would play on this pc would be ghost of tsushima since the time period and story looks really interesting!
Im starting a career in video game development, I play every game but unfortunately due to inflation and sudden spike in dollar exchange rate in my country, these PC which I would have easily afforded just 2 years ago is out of reach! It would be the greatest gift and boost to my life, feels like a blessing this video was recommended to me today. My 1060 is very aged now.
Rdr2 at 200 fps on this white beast been dreaming of a build like this for years. Respect for doing this giveaway
That setup is so pretty. I actually use my mom's work PC and sometimes she gets mad but I just like playing
Defiantly going to be playing some doom dark ages on this, I was impressed with how it handled 4K gaming.
According to ur caption, omg Away is so lucky to be given a Gaming Setup
Hmmmmm, the first game I would play would be Wuthering Waves. The new update comes Tuesday and I'm dying to see what happens next in the story. I love the white design, the extra money put into painting it was well spent
U always make incredible videos and who ever gets this pc will be really happy this shows two thing gaming doesn’t have a price and u can always enjoy playing even on a budget and second one person can truly inspire a group of people
I would love this build as my first proper gaming one, been gaming on a office pc for 4 years. And i love that you choose iems 
I myself use iem theyre great
This gaming setup would be a dream come true for me! I’ve been passionate about gaming for years, but I’ve never had the chance to own a real setup. I would use it not just for gaming, but also to start streaming and creating content. The first game I’d dive into is definitely eldenring and cod – it deserves to be experienced the way it was meant to be played. Thank you for giving people like me the chance to make this dream a reality!
That looks amazing! I been looking to get my first PC after being a Sony gamer my whole life, love the setup! I will be playing Apex or Monster Hunter
I am trying to learn Blender and I've almost quit because of my old laptop. As a 13 year old I would play The Finals if I had that setup. That is literally my dream setup. I haven't been able to get a console because of our financial situation.
Dude I wish I had a nice setup like this... because I only have a regular switch, but I'm sooo into gaming right now. So I will be very happy if I become this sick PC and nice setup
The first game I'd replay is Expedition 33. That game is beautiful.
First game I would play would probably be either Cod or Gta5. Also that wallpaper looks so good does it come with the setup?
i’ve been stuck with an ipad for quite awhile (my whole life ), and i would love to play helldivers 2 or something like that
I’m 21 years old and have been playing console my whole life, I’d play black myth wukong and hell divers 2.
Also this video reminded me that I have a white desk so the setup would actually look amazing on my desk.
Nice build. The 9060 XT 16GB is a good mid-range card from the reviews I’ve seen.
I been play on a console for a long time I been hoping to upgrade to a pc I like and subscribe oh yea the first game is Fortnite and Roblox
II’d play Warhammer 40K — the rich lore and strategy would inspire my content and fuel my growth as a creative and streamer. (I use my phone) It’d be a huge step forward as I have never owned a piece of tech like this or a console. Thank you for this opportunity
I haven’t been able to use my pc for 3 months now because my 1650 broke. My family is going through financial problems so I couldn’t buy a new one. This setup would be a crazy upgrade and looks awesome. I would love to finally be able to play god of war because that game looks super fun. Thx for reading my comment
Awesome build !! I would play cyberpunk 2077 and Wu Kong
The first game I play on this PC is Fortnight cz I love to play Battle Royal game like Fortnight, COD warzone,PUBG PC
Ive been stuck with an i5-2400s and a gt710 for the last 5 years, i tried upgrading the gpu 3 times but every time id have to return the gpu due to no display (bought used off of ebay). I bought this pc for £400 off of amazon back in 2020 during the gpu shortage. It's definitely not worth it, lol. The only games i have been able to play are minecraft and terraria, a small amount of valorant due to low fps, and i tried subnautica, which ran at ~15-20 fps at 480p lowest. The first game I'd play is half-life alyx since i own a quest 1 and would love to get into pcvr games. The first flatscreen game would be black myth wukong since that game's had my eye ever since it came out.
i would use this pc for making games and 3d modeling, and streaming
I would finally try intensive games like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2
I haven’t been getting the best luck lately and sure I just found your YouTube channel and you seem like a cool person to watch. I’m very into pcs but I don’t have the money to upgrade since I been trying to apply to jobs everyday. Ofc everyone has their own lives and their own problems, just having a new desktop pc sounds amazing bc I do need an upgrade I try to play my games on my old gtx 1650 laptop but I can’t really play my favorite games unless I do low 1080p and obviously it doesn’t run well idk if it’s bc it’s an laptop or it’s just reaching its old age. I appreciate that you’re giving us an opportunity to win a computer so good luck to everyone who wants it as well.
My first game will be the call of duty campaign, maybe the og series cuz never had a pc/laptoo to play, i just watch videos of it
the first video games i would be playing on this setup if i got it would be fortnite, and roblox and gta. I would love to win this because my birthdays coming up soon (august 2nd) and because all my friends have consoles and pc’s and i would love to have one as well. Best of luck! praying i get this pc.️️
I would love this setup since I play on PS4 and it's over a decade old I would play every game I can, Fortnite, call of duty, cyberpunk, minecraft, it would also help me a ton with content creation as I want to be a youtuber
I've really wanted to play Cyberpunk 2077 since it came out and I haven't spoiled anything for myself yet! I also want to start playing Rainbow Six Siege on PC which will be amazing with the 200hz monitor. Thank you so much for this opportunity!
Pc looks sick would love to upgrade my current computer and that is most definitely an upgrade
Definitely would play Black Ops 6 Campaign , a lot of Warzone and Apex legends . Can’t really play much of these as I’ve got a normal laptop but this upgrade would change my life
The 1st game i would like to play would be Infinity Nikki , i would love to explore the magical world , fight monsters and overall just have fun
Man I NEED this! I messed up my AM4 motherboard recently trying to upgrade my ryzen 7 3700x to a ryzen 7 5800xt . I'd be playing The Finals!
I'd definitely play Fortnite and cyberpunk. It's summersale, and I got it for 24€. My laptop is dying while playing it. The pc could easily play the game on high settings. And for Fortnite, the 5600 would be a good upgrade to my laptop CPU, drops every second and literally not playable other than creative. W video and thanks for the giveaway ofc.
""Dude, a full gaming setup is the ultimate dream! I live with 5 siblings, and frankly, my family just isn't in a position to afford a PC right now. Winning this wouldn't just be cool; it would genuinely mean the world to me and provide an incredible outlet. I'm always watching your videos, and this giveaway is such an amazing opportunity. Thanks for your generosity!""
I wish I had enough for any console or gaming equipment. I do all my vids on my phone and it would be so much easier especially for editing with a pc.
I would lowk run the R6 or Apex as first game, love my fps games
Prob cs2 enlisted cause geforce makes it look really fuzzy but respect for making a giveaway congratulations whoever wins it
The first game i would play is Call of Duty and i also want to start streaming. I only have an iphone right now so this would really help out
I really hope to get lucky in winning this snow beauty. Been laid off recently & this would immensely help with my current 15 year old laptop replacement as it is not windows 11 compatible. I would try my hand on the latest COD game Black Ops 6 like you did in your cool video. It's been years since I played any fps game. Fingers crossed & god bless for doing what you do best. Cheers!
I'm coming from the assembly video. I think the first game I'd play if I win would be Cyberpunk, which I bought on sale and have never been able to play due to the limitations of my current laptop. It would also allow me to be much more productive when working, since I'd be able to have more than five windows open without the computer slowing down. Greetings, and thanks for the opportunity to win this incredible machine.
i would love to run a good triple a game maybe god of war for sure good luck everyone
And I really need it for 3d projecting
If I won, I’d finally be able to play games like GTA, Valorant, and more like Fortnite with my friends. My ThinkPad can’t handle any of them, so I always get left out. It’d mean a lot to finally be part of the fun. Good luck to everyone though whoever wins deserves it!
The first game I would play would be Cyberpunk. I've been wanting to play that game for a while, but never had a system to get the best experience.
If I got this setup, I would definitely be playing some Elden ring on it. Also would probably be very useful for my game projects
shadow of the tomb raider, black myth wukon OR assassin's creed shadows im still using a oem work desktop and i really want a gaming pc
The first game im playing is gate of hell ostfront. Btw is my favorite game.
I do not have any grand reason like other people upgrading to a better PC. Even the thought of owning a Windows device, as a teenager from a third world country sounds like a dream.
Rust,siege, FPS games, the opportunities of a PC is endless
Huge fan!! The very first game I would play is probably ready or not.
I need that pc
The first game i will be playing is call of duty and then im super excited for the new upcoming games like battlefield 6 and borderlands 4! Also i wanted to play the division 2
The first game I will play is Minecraft, I’ve always wanted to play Minecraft with over 60 fps and I would also use shaders because my current laptop can’t run shaders without crashing, I will also use the pc for productivity, and I would love to play Minecraft with my friends without having to tell them my pc crashed every 10 mins, I love other games such as terraria but when I use mods on terraria it always stutters, wish you the best.
If I get this setup I’m definitely will finally play rust. Been watching people play it for years
First thing i would play would be Borderlands
I alr commented but i forget to mention the video game but the first game im gonna try is bo6 cuz ive always had trouble running it
I could really use that pc for MANY reasons. 1 being I have to play on my xbox in my basement on a tv almost as old as me cause there isnt enough room for a tv in my bedroom. Also I have to use a couch as a chair down there. Also besides gaming I want to learn things like coding and my laptop had been acting slow lately and is sometimes even laggy when I try to watch youtube on it. A PC would even help me with school work too as well as MANY other things. If I get that I can finally get my first setup in my room thats good. Good luck to everyone else
Finally, a gaming setup, instead of on console, I've never owned a pc, but the first game i would try would be cyberpunk 2077.
If I get this PC, I'll immediately play valorant since it's the game me and my best friend who sadly passed away played.
Cool video and PC setup. And I... would probably boot up minecraft first, and use some shaders to test the new ray tracing capabilities of the rx 9000 cards.
I've always wanted to play competitive games, especially fps titles, since my friends started playing warzone some years back, but a capable PC has always been out of reach. Winning this giveaway would be a dream come true, and the first game I'd load up would def be Warzone. Might take a while to catch up to my friends, but I've learnt a from watch gameplay online
Thank you for the chance
I really need to win this $1000 setup giveaway because my current PC and monitor are both extremely outdated and barely run modern games. My frame rates are so low that it’s hard to enjoy or even play competitive titles properly. The monitor is blurry and has a terrible refresh rate, which makes everything look worse than it should. I've tried making the most of what I have, but it's holding me back from fully experiencing the games I love. This new setup would be life-changing and finally let me game without constant frustration.
Hi I follow you back in 2020 and I really need a PC because my Xbox was broken in a thunderstorm. Love your vehicles.
I would definitely run some KCD2 on this PC if I had it.
If I get this PC I’ll play any type of smooth gameplay. I want to be able to have a fast working and smooth gameplay throughout everything I do. Like from the last video I would really love to have a pc, which I said before my parents don’t have enough money to afford one so I would be very happy to have this pc
Good luck. I hope i do win it tho but it not really my decision, my laptop from 2008 recently died it had 1 gig of ram an intel pentium cpu and it weighed about 9kg-11kg ( i called it chungus).
The first game I will play is probably minecraft at 16k with max shaders while running valorant and fortnite in the background both at max settings, can't wait
Satisfactory
looks great
First game will be minecraft with shaders!
I would try 4k gaming for first time on that beast
The first game I would play would be Metalstorm. I really enjoy it and it's free2play.
i will play palworld on this pc.
Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll win this PC or not, but if somehow I do — the first thing I’d do is play Palworld. 
I’ve watched so many people enjoy it on YouTube, and I’ve always wanted to experience it like that too. 
Right now, I try to play it on my phone using Chiiki cloud, but it lags so much. 
I don’t own a PC, and winning this would actually mean the world to me. 
Even if I don’t win, just wanted to say — thanks for giving people like me a shot at something like this
Definitely Spider-Man Remastered. This white setup is insane. —respect for this giveaway and i would love this since i am using a trash chrombook rn
I would play Black ops 6
I would love this pc, I've been playing on this dell OptiPlex 790 for 2 years now and it has a RX 560 and an intel core i7 2600 CPU this would be an absolute game changer!!! btw my first game would be some bo6 and Epic game titles!
i would like this setup because I need to upgrade my pc so I can play the latest games. I will be playing Assetto Corsa.
Hey man I would really enjoy playing rainbow six siege on this setup I really want it because all of my friends have pcs but I’m to broke to afford one
The first game I'd play on this is Warzone. I have an old Hp laptop that crashes a lot
would play uncharted 4 and rdr2 on this piece of art.
I would love to get this setup as I've been on co sole for a while, and the first game i would play is Minecraft, and i would try to get texture and shader packs. But if ur talking about the main game, then it would probably be fortnitw with the boys.
Bro I’d love to have it! I can’t continue my YouTube right now because my editing software just crashes when I load it.
The first game I would play is Destiny 2 or baldur's gate 3!
It’s a dream of mine to one day get a pc, the first game I would play is definitely cod
I have never had a pc but it would be a game changer if I got it and I make content and editing on my phone isn’t always the most efficiant
Hey man it’s me again. I would probably use the pc for either call of duty warzone or Fortnite. This would be a total game changer for me because me and my friends can enjoy gaming again. Best of luck to everyone - gage
The first game i would play is Wuthering Waves, but Isn't Rx 9060xt overkill for a R5 5600 (for me at least) ? Wish you also went with the white mobo and gpu to match the aesthetics, other than that, the system looks great, Man.
I need a pc for my architech study and have some fun when I want
I would really love this pc build recently all of my friends have been getting pc’s and I really want one too but everything is so expensive and I’ve been trying to save for a nice car and the first game I would play would most likely be call of duty because I love to play it at my cousins house
Satisfactory I need it
The first game would either be cod or gta cuz and the setup looks fire
Hi, the first game I would play is Valorant
Does graphic designing count has a game if so then it would be my first
I would play world of tanks because it has really good graphics and with the insane setup you put together I would be able to play the game with great graphics and that would be really fun and cool
I would probably play something like rocket league or COD for the first time as my current computer just can't handle it even with the worst settings on :( Also love the vids keep up the great work man!

Ipicked up this keyboard at MicroEnterfor $170 because it has three veryimportant specs. Rapid trigger lets youpress a key again before it even resetsback to the starting point. Hall effectswitches use magnets and sensors todetect the key press, which is a lotmore customizable and a lot faster. Andan 8000Hz polling rate means this isreporting back to your PC almost eighttimes more often than your averagekeyboard. Here we go. Typing test. Youknow, evenspacebar, please. Even beforeDoes this space bar not work?See, this is the trade-off. When youpush the limits, things start getting alittle finicky. The stabilizers soundgood, though. All right, I got itfigured out. And yeah, that'sresponsive. It feels like the key pressregisters before I even fully press downthe key, which is actually kind of hardto get used to. But if you did get usedto it, nobody's out strafing you withthis","All the fake schleerp ripoffs are crazy
Bro, this could make outros even faster! ️
I got used to the outro, and then we lost it...
Not giving SHLEERP his interview keeping you big as hell
keypress registering before you press it keeping you big as hell
we imposter shleerps must fight back against shleerpesque bots, like lil debbie and kevin durant fitness
The keyboards really give us a key in gaming.
Shleerp: 
Kevin Durant Fitness:
Lil Debbie:
the polling rate keeping you big as hell
And here i am, still with a G15v2 membrane keyboard thats 18 years old. Even every single led light is still working.
This can make outros even faster
Carter is amazing! And so would be our outros ️
Or, hear me out, wooting which has way more features, including RGB, for only 15-30 more dollars (depending on the size). Like wooting invented new technology for the 80he, and snappy tappy is literally so good that it’s banned in some competitive e-sports.
the key register is kinda hard to get used to… but it’s harder to get used to not having outros
the best keyboard you can buy keeping you big as hell
Every key registers except “O-U-T-R-O” ️
rapid trigger keeping you big as hell
gaming performance keeping you big as hell
Aren't all rapid trigger keyboards hall effect?
As far as i'm aware rapid trigger uses the magnet to even work
Someone gotta off little debbie bro
Bro doesn’t wanna reply to us!

All I care about is the thug shake Carter
Shleerp, we are waiting. Tick tock lil bro

Lil Debbie:

Bro you say this for every keyboard, lol
Man hall effect keyboards make me laugh so loud like what's next? Bernoulli's principle water-cooling?
Grab the camera for a Lamar Jackson Edit
for 170$ you could buy 17 keyboards off temu
Lil Debbie heard one keystroke and started baking an outro ️
What about the wooting 80he they make the best gaming keyboards and invented rapid trigger it’s the best keyboard even if you don’t want to game on it, it also sounds good
Now pick up the thug shaker ️
Bro is trying his best to glaze it XD
Shleerp, LittleDebbieisdagoat, ReKevinDurantFitnessOfficial, ShleerpFromTemu are the avengers of the youtube comment section
Keyboard clickin’ but the outro still missing in action
We want our Outro🫩
Carter idk if you’ll see this comment but could u buy or test out this gaming keyboard for me it’s called the Tiger Light Gaming keyboard by KBDFANS
Dothethugshake
Shleerp needs his Thugtro Carter
That keyboard got me emotional… but where’s the outro to wrap it all up
8 times more often that the average keyboard keeping you big as hell
Try the ducky one x multi point trigger keyboard, it’s deliciously good
It would also be nice if the thugtro would be 8000 hz ️
We need our apology after you thought GTA4 was GTA5
Just buy the attack shark X68HE has all those features for 70 bucks
Can’t stop laughing at that crash out fr
not talking about the durability of hall effect keeping you big as hell
The space bar doesn’t work - just like us without the outros
hall effect keeping you big as hell
carter im so mad at you.🫵 I’ve been watching you for 4 years . I’ve been bonding emotionally with your videos️… ever since the outros I would come home longing the next video and outro. the outros are so amazing they instantly level up my mood. you’ve said you’d become more responsive to us YouTube viewers but you are more responsive to those damn keys. how dare you not keep the outros?! how dare you disappoint me?! my life has been ruined! all thanks to you🫵🫵, Carter! The “king of pcs” or whatever it is that I bet you call yourself at home smiling at the mirror. this is truly just heart crushing…️
Bro lil debbie shleerp and daddy bron flooding the comments
gaming keeping you big as hell
Keyboard goin crazy, outro still on vacation ️️

Way more responsive than you to us telling you to put the outro back in...
Kevin vs schlerp has begun
Carter I seriously need a pc

Where is the Thugtro?️
Outro watching from the sidelines like: “he don’t need me fr”
pushing limits keeping you big as hell
magnets and sensors keeping you big as hell

Its really a responsibility to keep the Outro going.
The thing is that nowadays this is the standard, and I’ve heard there are pretty cheap boards that have all these…

Wooting is so much better Carter
mashing spacebar keeping you big as hell
You could totally be a narrator with that studio level shotgun mic monologue.
What is it called? I want it!!!!!
Bro it will make the thugtro quicker ngl
Mcchoose ace 60 has all of those for £30, used it for a few months and it’s great
Boy, that keyboard is sure fast! unlike Carter responding to us
microcenter keeping you big as hell
Bro why doesn’t he have 1 mill yet he deserves it
Please carter
This sounds perfect for rythm games
170$ is a little too much
The Atack shark ajaaz ak820 black with red switches is the perfect keyboard for me.
Amazing,now on the main topic.
1. Thug shake every 10 videos
2. An Intro and Outro every video,have your editors work 24/7 / no food / no water
3.Give Dino a PC
When is the Shleerp Interview
We want our outro back
The Problem with being faster than light, is that you only see darkness
Keyboard stabilizer sound keeping you big as hell
Keyboard crispier than a Lil Debbie snack ️
the space bar made bro crashout
Bros changing keyboards every week he ain't beating the rich allegations.
bro picks up his keyboards but doesn’t pick up girls (Carter pick up on us telling you to bring back the outros)
customizability keeping you big as hell
New keyboard so responsive, it dodged the outro mid-keystroke
Give us an Outro Carter
So many contestants. This will be tough to beat.
Bro this is actually sick. Too bad it doesn’t look better
guys hes gonna start ignoring us again if we keep doing this
That poor space bar. Imagine crashing out to a space bar. Totally me
Day 36 of asking carter to apologize to the GTA community for mistaking GTA 4 with GTA 5
The wooting is just better
Putting it on the deskmat sound have sounded better potentially
i got used to super sensitive keys and its great
You better keep that 8,000 hz response time for the outro
It is THE best cuz Carter said so. Carter
Is the razor huntsman mini v3 pro good?
Sayodevice
I personally like the Wooting 80HE more than the PCMK2
i would need this for rythm games man
Schleerp is my savior
Kevin Durant Fitness Needs His Pc
That keyboard snappy — unlike the outro delivery

170 dollars keeping you big as hell
Is that shleerp PC!?
I wonder how fast I could type ""we need our outro back!"" on that keyboard. ️
DEBBIE YOU ARE NOT SHLEERP YOU WILL NEVER BE SHLEERP
You should be able to change the rgb on the ram sticks to match them with the rest of the build.
rapid trigger will help so much for playing fnf
That black gpu sticks out so hard from the rest of the build. Like the outro… which isn’t here…
#ineedmyPConmydoorarrived
carter asmr keeping you big as hell
-Brand new product
-plug it in
-something's not working
-smash it
Someone needs to customize Carter’s MonkeyType
When are you dropping the lil debbie mukbang
i thought the mic was carter's secret robot hand
If anyone needs a pc that'd be me
Carter’s gonna make videos faster than the flash
Carter needs to make a flip book of him doing the thug shake. List it for 400 dollars
The keys are responsive but you aren’t… where’s our outro
Carter, just make keyboard videos please, they're the only ones where you actually know what you're talking about it seems
responsiveness keeping you big as hell
I want my dad back but I want the outros back more ️
Yesterday I commented on one of your new videos and I asked for this video and idk if you make it because of my comment but thanks for making it w vide
What style you rockin with the apartment? Gotta love minimalistic.
Shleerp outro gang
I need that cuz I play typing games and my keyboard limits me sometimes
When is gonna my PC arrive to my door Carter!
1. That keeb isn't even good, there are better options under 170
2. Most magnetic keebs have 8k polling nowadays
3. It isn't hard to get used to low actuation at all, unless you set it to bare minimum where it actuates even if you rest your fingers
you realise all mechanical linear switches actuate before they are fully pressed down righr
I am your bigest fan
Snap tap in the corner after you just said no one was out strafing
You can literally hear the keyboard responding… the outro? Not even whispering
Yhe key press might be registering immediately and it takes longer for yhe signal from the hand to get to your brain that for it to go to the computer, process, get to your eye and then to your brain
I bet your computer can run the thugtro
Bros hitting it like a baby
I will not stop until i get a pc
Bro listed 3 features that all modern hall effect boards have nowadays
If I could get this with a fill side number pad I would be happy
That's how mechanical and hall effect keyboard works man...

Okay.What? You thought that was it? Youshould get off the gaming camera.Cue the montage.[Music][Applause][Music],"Bro's an Inspiration to all the Nerds
Hello new people, please remember.. this man already finished his main story campaign called life, he's just doing side quests at this point or maybe just started new game plus >_<
The definition of ""I'm good at everything I do""
6 months ago I didn’t know who this man was. 
5 month ago I thought about blocking him. 
Now I want to be his bestie.
Proud to say that the Greatest Nerd of All time is a Filipino.
There's Cristiano and Messi but then there's Dino
Bro that chair is for decoration at this point with how little he gets to sit on it
No way bro visited avengers villa
Try as you may, this guy will never lose. He is invincible.
Bro like's ""dam i am good in everything""
The world is your gaming chair.
My dear cait_evacula. That ""Cue the montage "" hits harder than 5 Filipino back slaps.
Dude actually kinda looks sick
Dino being Dino. And I am here for it
the Ultimate bro nerd
can you sing the ""mas mahal mo ba ang dota""
again with the final boss?
That ""get of your gaming chair"" after grabbing the phone
Meanwhile I’m feeling blessed to just have the weekend off work . 

I am so happy for ppl when I see montages like this & at the same time equally inspired to try to somehow achieve even a fraction of this freedom.
Dam 
Fire ass montage man
Our bro is always funny but with the shaving he looks very sharp (now I understand how he got his girl )
I think your shorthair and godfather mafia mob hairstyle suit the best on you!! Keep creating smiles brother. 

Im also a father gamer from Indonesia.
Sir Dino, I realized po na maganda po mustache ninyo! Naku baka may sponsor naman to? God bless po and family. Watching your vids in FB and YT!
This man is really leaving his best life
Some of us get off to work to school to home and repeat all year long
Remember he is even a father
Love it. It's like I'm just taking a break from all I've done
Awww his daughter is cuteee
The Nerd Above All
Your such a chill guy
Love ur vids
absolute domination! bless you!
Elden Rings .....No Dino Rings
He's already flexing without needing to flex anything
Henry Cavil is dying to be bro's friend since 2015
Bro is the MC that he thinks he is, and that we all want to become
Love you Dino.. for what you are.
Bro bring 'touched some grass' to the whole new level
idk why people are still trying, this man always wins
Bros literally dino the explore
You should Compete in a body building competition
Bro is living the ultimate dream
What's sick is that he knew they would have asked him that. And he prepared montage worthy clips years ahead
bro that SHAAAAAAAVE!!!!!!!!
I frkn love this guy.
bench 180kg, squat 250kg, deadlift 300kg, do it dino!!!
Bro just reliving past travels
The final boss against gamer stero types
Am i trippin or did i just see him at the avengers headquarters
Bro doesn't flex . He is the Flexxx
Dino after that: tonight we will steal the
Day 3 of asking dino to make an updated room tour
Why is no one talking about the avenger building
Bro gaming in the hot tub is crazyyy
Remember guys, if Dino gives away a free PC. We need to check on him if his life is in danger.
Bro you are so fucking funny I love all your videos
He did get off the chair n slept on a ford car
The dry trumpets got me
I thought he was going to put a vr headset on and do some standing up gaming
Newbies thought he's sitting there all day. He's just sitting there since his baby is sleeping and his wife gone shopping.
Bros flex is more crazy
At this point this guyd is Undefeated I guess...
Inspiration to all us Mexican's
Bros mustache is like a hairy gaming mop
Dino idol kita pare. Gusto ko nga rin magkaron ng mga meron ka e. Pero ano kaya kung pumunta ka naman sa Church hahahaha. Gagawin mo ba?
Undefeated
that's awesome!
Kapabayan solid fan mo ako
Nice background edit
Bro got bored with having no competition so he gives reactions to idiots on the internet for entertainment

What a chad he is
In every single clip bro looks like he's mocking us
Another victory for Dino
bro literally won in life a wife a career related to his hobby and world tour
5k likes for a black ultimate pc build!!!!!!!
Thw definition of ""i have no real life but just social media videos at my disposition""
Bro has premium subscription to life
Yung alam mong mas gwapo ka pag naka clean cut ka and no beard and mustach, pero mas pinili mo pa din ang haggard look na mukhang siga sa kanto style hehe. I got you bro️
brow has been touching grass long before touching grass was a thing.
Biggest flexer ever seen on YouTube

Let's jump into the video.Hello guys, welcome back to my channel Unbox and \nBeyond and my name is Srini. This channel is allabout the first impression and overview of the \nproduct. So I have recently purchased a sit andstand desk from IKEA. So this particular table is \nspecially targeted to the people who are mostlyinto gaming. However, as it is a sit and stand \ndesk and very good for ergonomic. So that's thereason I have bought this table and I have bought \nthis table for my work purpose and also this tablecan be shared between my family members. So the \nheight of the table can be adjusted from 72 cm to120 cm and the tabletop size is 140 cm. However, \nthis also can be extended to 180 cm. So friends,overall this particular desk for the price of \n€300 is worth it and it can handle a maximumload of 70 kilos. Well, I have just purchased \na desk and I I just did the setup. I hope youlike the video. So without further do, let's \nget into the unboxing setup and the review.First, let's see what's inside the box.The gaming desk comes in two different \nsections, tabletop and underframe. Theunderframe has two boxes. Box one, instruction \nmanual, motorized legs, plus electronic parts.In box two, you have legs \nand some supporting frame.You can see all the parts in this short clip.Now before you start the setup or the assembly \nI would highly recommend to go through theinstruction manual couple of times. Now follow \nthe guide as per the instruction manual step bystep. And the first and important thing is to \nbuild the underframe as per the instruction.Rememberyour tabletop size is 140 or 180 cm and you \nhave to adjust the under frame accordingly.Once the frame is ready, it is now time \nfor fixing the electrical units. It isstraightforward. Just follow the manual \nand give the connection accordinglybefore attaching the underframe with the tabletop. \nBetter to test it. Here you go. I am now checkingthe up and down movement for my desk. And once I'm \nsatisfied, now it is time to open the tabletop.The tabletop which I got is of 140 cm \nand it comes with a solid black color.The build quality is good and \nalso it looks heavy. and sturdy.The tabletop comes with predefined holes and \nit is easy to connect to the underframe. So,simply fix the screw and you are ready.It took me almost 3 hours to assemble the desk and \nthat's because I was using a normal screwdriver.If you have a power screwdriver, \nthe assembly is even faster.The entire underframe is made up of metal \nwhich makes it strong and sturdy. And thelook and feel also matches the gaming vibe. I \nespecially like the color black. And now yourhigh performance gaming desk is ready for high \nperformance gaming. Remember to customize theheight presets. Refer the instruction manual for \nspecific instructions. And if you encounter anyissues with the height adjustment, refer to \nthe manual or contact IKEA customer service.Well, from my point of view, uh I feel in \nthe price of €300, this particular sit andstand table is worth it. The reason because it \ncomes with a strong and sturdy underframe. Thetabletop is also quite heavy and also which I \nlike it has a uh set of presettings where youcan store the settings of different heights. \nIt comes with a USB-A charging point. You canconnect any devices for charging and you don't \nneed to run around for USB ports. So friends,that's all in this video and I hope you like the \nvideo and also this video help you to make somedecision. I have also done uh setup and review \nof couple of other sit and stand desk. I'll sharethe link in the description below. So that's all \nin this video. Do let me know in comment sectionif you're using this particular desk and what \nare your thoughts. And also make sure to like,share and subscribe my channel and \nI will see you in the next video.","Durable, stylish, and ergonomic gaming desk the IKEA UPPSPEL is absolutely worth it!
Does this table wobble when you work on it?
€300 is expensive

So, thisis my Mac that was always been here. Buton this side was the PC. What's therenow? Well, another Mac. Huh. This is the2024 M4 Mac. And I've had this inanother room for I guess the last 6, 7months. So, it just wasn't really beingused. This is going to be a gamingcenter. And you notice I have twokeyboards and two mice. Like, what's upwith that? Well, Logitech provided methis keyboard. This is the G915 TKL. Ilike this one because just nice feel andI still don't know what this rollerthing does but it's just a nice layoutof a keyboard is clean. I have onecomplaint though. You see this littleadapter I had to buy put here. Thiskeyboard for some reason has micro SD.What in the one of the most popular micein the world? I think like the G502series is amazing. This is the X Plusthat Logitech provided for me. Thank youso much. Look what just came out today.Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate. So, this is aMac M4 with 32 gigs of RAM. So, this canhandle this game with no problem. Hey,here we go. Okay, by the way, I didfigure out this is volume. That's socool. It's Yes, I heard the quick presetfor this Mac is best cuz it'll use the,you know, everything automatically. Butlet's look at the other options. You cango low, medium, high, ultra. Wait, okay,then that's the rate tracing. So, lookslike it has cross progression. So, I canWow, I can get my account from playingit on Xbox. All right, I turned crossprogression on. Hit load game. Yep,there it is. And that's from my Xbox.So, I love that. And yep, I'm in. Thisis the uh what's it? Liberty DLC. And II finished it, so I won't spoil it.Don't worry. But it's good. You lookkind of tough. Oh,wait. One hit. Hey, dude. I'm reallysorry. You okay? Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh uh uhuh uh. All right. I am not a keyboardand mouse person. So, I'm pretty new atit. So, I'm learning. So, the game looksgood, performance good. I need yourhelp. Should I use the controller toplay or should I learn how to do mouseand keyboard? If so, what do yourecommend? Like, like how do I learn it?Cuz I I know it's WD and all that andthe move. But I I get confused. I'm old.I mean, this is a great mouse fromLogitech and this is a fantastic gamingkeyboard. So, I know I got the optimalstuff here. I just got to get braveenough to use it. So, I could use anyadvice in the comments. Living up.","Micro USB in the year of our lord 2025 is WILD
This setup is going to be PERFECT for Cyberpunk! Enjoy!
For any shooter i recommend Mouse and KB 
Anything thats not point and click, such as a racing game, controller
For my PC games I normally play with both a controller and mouse/ Keyboard and will switch between them depending on what I am doing in game also the setup looks great, thanks for the tour!
Hey Lamar, I heard there's a new donkey Kong out now and you should able to try donkey Kong bananza
Tbh, I would've expected Logitech to send the G915X TKL, not the original
I’m really not into technology but I just enjoy watching your shorts & I also learn something new lol much love
Didn’t know Cyberpunk was available for Mac. I am sure my M1 MacBook Pro probably can’t handle it but kind of gives me a reason to upgrade, even through I don’t want to lose the touchbar. Anyway regarding keyboard/ mouse vs controller do what feels most comfortable for you. They both have advantages and disadvantages. I tend to prefer controllers through.
W Logitech
I can only imagine how hard it will be going from controller to keyboard but I want to learn lol
Definitely learn mouse and keyboard! once you get used to it, is so much more fun to use, makes joystick feel like you are handicapped. but only for Shooters and stuff like this where you need to aim.
i've tried k/m, but i prefer controller. especially for action / shooter games. i just like the feel of a trigger instead of a mouse click. especially if you have a pro controller. some games like Sims i'll use k/m for that though.
Learn M & K it’ll be fun to hear your progress as you play
Use a PS5 controller connected via usb-c cable. Best experience overall. And more comfy; you can lay back and relax.
I downloaded it for my m4 MacBook Air works well on medium 1080p im getting around 40 fps but I limited it to 30 fps for duh termal management it doesnt have a fan. I will use this m4 air gaming on the go with cross save. also ps5 controller has adaptive trigger, haptic feedbacks and AirPods has head tracked audio. experience is surreal imho at least its good on the go because it only used 13 percent battery in 40 minutes, this is nuts
I usually use PlayStation controllers when I play games on my laptop, but doom eternal isn’t compatible with PlayStation controllers for some reason, so I played the entire game plus dlc with keyboard and mouse. It was jarring and odd at first, but once you get into the flow of things it feels incredible. Now I’m not sure if it’s the same for Cyberpunk, but I was able to quickly swap weapons with my scroll wheel or use the number keys at the top to do the same thing. But it’s mainly just getting used to the layout there’s not too much advice I can give other than that, so just try keyboard and mouse if you feel like it and get yourself comfortable with the layout of all the buttons, over time it does become muscle memory so you shouldn’t have too much problems after a while.
Mouse and keyboard is better, just stick with it, keep playing and you’ll get used to it. Like riding a bike
Nice!
That’s cool! I would use controller.
You should play with Controller on your Mac ️
Love you Lamar
67
I say if you're used to controller use controller. If you want to use mouse and keyboard go for it. Take your time and learn mouse and keyboard if you want?
Play how you want to play
6 7LOL️
How tf do people just send you stuff how do i sign up ?
Why does gaming on a Mac feel weird
learn keyboard and mouse while play on controller
I would just stick to controller but Lamar why would you get rid of a PC and Switch to a Mac to play video games? What they got like 3 games on Mac now?
Gaming on Mac is not really a thing everything on pc
lammmmar!
I can't tell that clearly from the video, but it looks like you're using your index finger on the W key. 

Make sure you use your middle finger on W and your index on D, with your ring finger on A.

I chosethe Xbox One S to power the whole setupcoming in at a price of around $100used. It surprisingly performs prettydecent in every game still. And sinceit's an Xbox, you get access to so manymore apps. For the monitor, I went withthe Titan Army 240 Hz monitor, whichcosted $130. Although this is superoverkill for the Xbox, it was the onlymonitor I could use, but I'm definitelynot going to complain. I also decided togo with this MAG 75% keyboard with thiscool white and black design. It has redswitches and even a cool volume knob.And for only $25, it was definitelyworth it. Next up, for the mouse, I'musing the Steel Series Rival 3. It'snothing too special, but for $20, you'regetting an amazing quality wired mouse.The whole setup came out really simple.So, let me know what you guys think andstay tuned to see how the setup performsin gaming.","I love how he has a 60fps console pair up with a 240hz gaming monitor that is more expensive then the console it self
Holy 2 vids in same week ️️
I hope u make the comeback
I like how you basically did what I did on my channel. I have a 60 hertz 1080p monitor that my teacher gave me, a keyboard from walmart (12$), a mouse from walmart (14$), and an original 1 TB xbox one that I bought off my dad for 90$ (with a manually installed rgb fan [pack of 5 rgb fans was 15$] and new thermal paste [7$]).
sound.
gimme 300 dollars i can make a gaming setup with a pc
You could get a GTX 1060 with like a Ryzen 5 4500 with a cheap motherboard and 16 gig of DDR4 or even 8 if you find them all used you could get a pc for under 300$
you could make a pc to beat the xbox. but im not complaining.
You could have gotten a used series a for around 150$
Yo i just need the 130$ screen
This setup is pretty good for when you get a PC but the one s is trash for performance
BRO WHAT IS KEYBOARD I NEED IT FOR REAL IS IT ON AMAZON??
«And since it’s an XBOX you get access to so many more apps”… dawg what? PCs have a thousand more apps than XBOXes, but you can also use messengers, browsers, work, and do anything on them, and like a PC with some integrated graphics would’ve been better

BUT, still great vid, keep trying, I believe you can hit like a 100K, you deserve it ️
Fire
Nice
You spent way too much on the keyboarded mouse and the monitor you probably could have gone in an Xbox series. S and a controller and monitor
yo sai howd u get xbox s for 100 bucks?
I dont think its a pc anymore
waht is a xbox one s
br0 130 d0IIa f0r a m0nit0r thats 0nIy 40 hz is a scam br0 u c0uId have g0tten 120 0r 180 hz
He spent more money in the montitoe then the Xbox and the monitor is useless for the one s. If he spent the money in the Xbox it could he better
Keyboard and mouse on a mostly controller setup is stupid

We have aWindows 11 machine right here, but itcurrently wants me to connect to anetwork, or else it will not let mecontinue. But there's a way around that.When you're greeted with a screen,you're going to click shift F10 like so.And it's going to bring up your commandprompt. And then we're going to type inOB/passn. So, now that we have the commandprompt done, it's going to reloadWindows. And the next time you're goingto have a completely different promptwhen it gets to that Windows screen. So,let's go ahead and check out the Wi-Fi.And then we're going to skip the layout.And you'll see this is when it's goingto ask you for your Wi-Fi. Now, you havethe option that says, ""I do not haveinternet."" So, we can skip all of that.And if you don't have Wi-Fi or internetat the time, you can actually getthrough this and install Windows.","The oobe\bypassnro command does not work anymore on newer windows 11 builds. So instead, another way to bypass the MS account requirement is to type in a command into cmd called start ms-cxh:localonly. This will bring up a window where you can type in your local account information instead of the one for Microsoft.
We have a windows 11 machine right here the machine: Windows 10
I would create a flash drive and load Arch btw
Linux users can build their entire system from scratch on an air-gapped computer while Windows users can't even use their OS without internet
THANK YOU SO MUCH DUDE. im a budding it tec and this is something i am stuck on right now.
i was just doing this the other week, so this is very useful!
Clean your screen man!!
Oobe means out of box environment or experience depending on who you ask. It's basically just away to setup third party software for system builders.
can't do that no more :(
I had to do that today for my friends pc because he was switching from amd to Intel so we had to install windows to his new system but was a hole thing.
How is this the leading operating system???
Clean your monitor screen bro
anti consumer bs
start ms-ch:localonly
This command prompt bypasses the need for that annoying restart you triggered.
I had windows 10 then upgraded and still have a local account
That Windows 10
Cyberpower!!!!!!!!
You know what would be easier. If Microsoft didn't do this bullshit with its os.
Dude, clean up your screen before you fill it

That's literally Windows 10
Dumb they wouldn't just have it in there
hey hey hey hey GUESS WHAT Microsoft took that out you can no longer bypass the sign in now lol lol thank god i have my windows 11 CD ahahhahaha if i ever decide to go to windows 11 in about 5 years
That is not windows 11
My appreciation for Linux grows daily.
you said slash but showed a backslash so for the people out there it’s oobe\bypassnro

Now, I'm going to be runningthis for at least a month. So, if I haveany problems going from a super high-endbuild to like an entry-level build, I'mgoing to tell you guys all about it.

That mini pc is my dream pc bro
Try not to look out of touch 2025: IMPOSSIBLE VERSION
$1,000 is mid range to high end, i'd consider around the $450-$600 price point to be budget, and everything in between is mid range
700 to 1000 dollars and ""budget build""? Bro, that's a dream pc for me. Mine current is 280 dollars
What are the specs on that $3000 build? From the looks of it, my $700 budget build will outperform it
ITX a BUDGET BUILD??????
Budget builds like the one in this video tend to be more expensive when bought onlime compared to building it yourself. My take is, if you cant build it yourself you are better off buying a high end PC compared to these so called budget builds which cost about the same or higher price when making an online purchase.
Buddy. 1,000 is NOT a budget build. That’s midrange.
Ditch it right over here!
700$ is mid range and anything under 550 is budget
What is that case? That gpu mount postition is dope!
bro 700-1000 is more than my entire pc setup pc monitor speakers amp mouse and keyboard combined falls at like 500 new
300-500 is a budget build
Dune Awakening is a really good game, the endgame has to be reworked a bit, because for solo players it's impossible to progress but overall goty 2025 for me
Can i have the pc you gonna ditch? Maybe just the cpu lol

Anyways,i think it looks nice
But i assume you have a very cool room
You shouldnt have any problems with it
Can I have a PC pls

Sedetta. Don't know how tosay it, but it's an L-shaped gamingdesk. It's 62 inches, but it's L-shaped,but you can make it one long desk tomake it 87 in. It has cabinets anddrawers and pegboards. But instead of mejust talking about it, let's put ittogether so you can see what I'm talkingabout. I got a timer here. See how longthis takes. I've built desks before andit's taken me hours. So, I'm not lookingforward to this, honestly. So, let'sjust get this started. What? Or not? Youbeeping on me. Is that the right Oh,there you go. And timer started. Allright. Let's Let's get started.I need space.[Music]This is going to take me a while.[Music]It's been5 minutes.Let's break. Uh there's differentoptions. Four options. Lesk. Let's justdo option one. And then what? You knowwhat? I don't have enough memory onthese memory cards. About to find out.Step one. How many steps are in thisthing? It's a lot of pages. Oh jeez.This thing is 40 pages. All right. Or 40steps.Three and four. All right. Oh, JesusChristover here just for now cuz I think I'mbuilding the frame first.[Music]Oh, cool. this outlet thing. That'scool. It's got four uh four outlets uphere and USB A, but that's fine. Yeah.See, some of these steps are reallyquick stuff. I was just putting twoscrews in.[Music][Music]Let's get this on the ground before Iscratch this up.All right, soC camera 2 was down, so resounding thisone now. It's fine. And we're aboutover an hour in now.All right, we are on step. What step isthis? Step11.All right, where are we at, though? Hey,before I start, I lost my tool. No,turn you around.It's actually pretty late.Actually,[Music]I'm pretty sure you're set, right? So, Ijust put you Oh my god, you're heavy.[Music]Let'sheavier this way. Jeez, I forgot you'reheavy.Heavy.I'm right.That's it. I think we're done. Otherthan the wall mounts, but I can't reallywall mount this right now cuz not thisis not where I'm leave everything at.111 minutes plus 21. It's 130 132minutes. That's over 2 hours. 2 hoursand12 minutes. 2 hours 12 minutes. Allright, that camera 2 is back. And wherewe at here? I took way too long. 2 hoursand 12 minutes to put this thingtogether. But it's done.All right, I'm going to take a break.Then we'll go over all the features ofthis desk. I'm so tired.Oh man.So yeah, here's the L-shaped desk fromSedetta. Now, this is just one of fourconfigurations for this desk. You canhave it set up the way that I do here,or you can have the hutch on the otherend of this desk, or you can make itjust one long desk with the hutch onceagain on either side. The desk is madeof P2 particle board, which is durableand anti-cratch, which I scientificallytested earlier. Three and four. Allright. Oh, Jesus Christ. It uses a thickmetal frame to keep everything togetherand secure. It has adjustable feet padsto keep the desk stable on uneven floor,and they also help to protect the floorfrom scratches. So, this has fivedrawers on the side. From the pictures,I thought they were going to be moresolid wood or metal drawers, but they'refabric drawers. Not a big deal, butsomething to know so you don't get yourhopes up like I did. They're pretty bigdrawers, though, which will help youkeep your desktop organized and free ofclutter. Let's not talk about how mycurrent desk setup looks like right now.There's a display cabinet over here thathas pop out glass doors. I don't thinkit's actually glass, but either way,it's see-through, so you can seeeverything that's in there. And there'sthe LED light strip along the top here.here to nicely light up whatever youhave in here. There's an app that youcan use so that you can control thelights, or you can just use the controlthat's wired into the lights. You willhave more control of the lights ifyou're using the app, though. The lightshave a mic built in, so you can have thelight color change in rhythm with soundor music. Does this light up the soundof my voice? Oh, it's it's changing atthe sound of my voice. That's kind ofcool. Or you can just use the timerfunction to create an enjoyableatmosphere. There's a pegboard alonghere, so you can hang things likeheadphones or controllers.It only comes with five hooks, though,so you'll have to pick some up if youneed more. Along the side where thedrawers are are two iron hooks, so youcan hang a bag or whatever over here.Built into the tabletop of the desk is apower strip with four outlets and twoUSBA ports so you can easily power upyour printer, phone, computer, anythingyou need to power on up here. So, mythoughts on this desk. For the price ofjust over $200, it's a good option. Thedesk isn't as deep as I would prefer. Imight be too used to my editing desk,but I like to have a lot of space on mydesk. This is probably good for peoplewho don't have a lot of space in theirwork area, though. The drawers beingfabric. I know I said it's not a bigissue, but it uses plyboard to keepeverything together, so you're not goingto want to put heavy items in there. Thepower strip is nice, but it's in thecorner, or if you have the desk set uplike I do, it's on the far end of thedesk. I'm not sure how to improve onthis, though, since the placement can begood or bad for you depending on whichdesk configuration you go with. But theway I have this set up right now, it'snot really ideal. The display case doorsdon't really sit even. It doesn't botherme until I turn the lights on in thecabinet, and you can see the uneven gapsin the doors. This triggers my OCD alittle bit. And finally, those lightsare just a light strip that you stickonto the top of the cabinet. I've onlyhad this desk for a little bit, and thelights already started coming off on theside. I do have those clips that I canmount there that would help, I guess,but it still just feels a little cheap.But yeah, once again, for the price,it's a good option. I have the blackcolor here obviously, but you can alsoget it in rustic brown or white as well.I'll have everything linked in thedescription if you're interested in thisdesk. All right, I need to go clean upmy editing desk. I didn't realize howmessy it was until right now.See you.[Music]","40 Steps omg and the part where you almost fell
great review!!! i just bought this and currently have it staring at me in the living room waiting to get put together but this gave me a great idea on what to fully expect once it’s done + assembly time!

He is genuinely impressed with it all and it has elevated his gaming experience.\n\nHere is a link to the Atlas Desk: https://tinyurl.com/2bt5c2br\n\nYou can also use my code “PETER20” for a sweet 20% off 💪🏻\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please give it a thumbs up and let me know in the comments what you think of it or if you have any questions about it ✌🏻\n\n🚀 Don’t forget to subscribe and hit the bell so you never miss a video!\n\n📲 Stay Connected\n—————————————\nInstagram: @peterpandev\nTikTok: @peterpandeveloper\nWebsite: https://links.petergeorgiou.tech\n\nThanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one! 🚀\n#gamingroom #setup #esports #blacklytedesk #blacklytegamingchair #gamingdesk #blacklyte #desksetup #gaming #gamingsetup\n\nTimestamps\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 The plan\n01:41 Unboxing\n03:28 Initial thoughts\n04:52 George’s reaction\n05:38 Desk features\n07:12 One week later\n08:27 My honest thoughts",UCh_3XIVQLMvM50Z0xQltlwQ,@peterpandev,,139000,73189966,218,2022/8/12 0:00,"Hey everyone!\n\nMy name is Peter and i'm a frontend web developer with a passion for awesome tech.\n\nI started this amazing journey on Instagram (@peterpandev) which has helped me break out of my comfort zone and share my journey in creating the dream setup. I believe the place you spend most of your life should work for you and help you achieve that maximum productivity boost. \n\nI'm here to help you achieve just that by sharing cool tech, productivity tips and most importantly how you can work smarter, not harder.\n\nIt's going to be a hell of a ride and I can't wait to share this experience with you all.\n\nPeter\n\n\n","Heat.[Music][Music]Heat.[Music]It's hot out there, man. If you live inCyprus, you know the heat. Welcome backto the channel. My name is Peter, andtoday I'll be doing something a littlebit different. You see, a friend of minemoved to a new house, and he's an activegamer, so he's been gaming for prettymuch forever. So, I reached out to abrand that I've worked with before, andthey've sent over the Atlas desk. AndI'm really looking forward to unboxingthis thing. It's heavy. So, the boxactually arrived a week ago. We moved iton Thursday. I think today's Sunday.These boxes were very heavy, which Ihope show that they're very durable andvery, very good quality inside. Now,we've moved those boxes and I can seethem right here. I'm looking forward toactually unboxing this because I've hadmy eyes on this desk for a while now.Now, full disclosure, Blacklight didsend me the desk for review and to helpmy friend with this video, but thatdoesn't mean I won't provide any honestreviews about it. This is the space thatwe'll be setting it up.So, yeah, we're not going to go over thetop here. We're just going to set up thedesk. I want to actually see how thisthing functions and if it lives up toits hype. So, let's get to the unboxingand I'll see you on the other side.[Music]Heat.[Music]Heat.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Applause]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]Heat[Music]uphere.[Music]So, that was tiring. Not going to lie.Really, really tiring. But nothing to dowith the desk. Desk was super easy toset up. This desk literally has RGB allover it. I absolutely love these cornerelements of the desk. I mean, they'remag they magnetically attach to the deskand it's just an amazing feature. Youcan manually adjust them and controleach light individually. And obviously,the desk itself is a sitst stand desk,so it will rise. It's heavy. It'sdurable. All right. And the size is notthat bad. I thought at the beginning thesize would be a bit small, but lookingat it now, I actually really like it.It's a perfect size. It can fit his PCon there. We've got a 32-in monitor inthe middle. He's got a 28 in, I believe,on the side vertically. Obviously,thanks to the monitor arms, that doeshelp free up more space on the desk. So,yeah, if you're in the market for agaming desk, something that's full ofRGB all over it, something that's gotadjustable lighting. Um, there is onething I want to try. There is a driverthat I need to install on the computer,and I think that makes the lights syncup. I mean, it's a great start. In time,I think we're going to upgrade the wall.We're going to get some get somepaneling up on the wall, get some morelights, maybe some hex lights from NanolLeaf or something like that. Um, but inthe meantime, let's wait for hisreaction. So, yeah, I'm just waiting forhim to get home and I'm going to filmhis reaction to see what he what hethinks of this.Welcome. Hello.I know you said wait for you, but Ididn't wait.Yeah. No. Come on, man.cable. I did a little bit of cablememory. Oh, it's fine. Oh my god. I willchange it in the near future to getanother one horizontally. One of thecoolest things about this desk comparedto its competitors is that RGB lighting.So, you can actually customize it withina dedicated app by black light. And youcan you can have the lights sync upbased on the music that you're playingand also have them sync to various gamesthat you're playing as well. This way itgives you completely full immersion intothe actual game itself. The lights willchange color depending on what gameyou're playing and what colors are shownon the screen. This is done via USB uhcable that comes within the desk. Sobasically you plug the desk into yourcomputer via the USB cable and let thedriver do its thing. That is the onestandout feature compared to itscompetitor. That paired with how heavythis desk is. It shows its durability aswell. Fact that it comes with a dualmotor system means it's sturdy enough.It's quiet when it rises and quiet whenit's lowers down as well. Does come witha magnetic mouse pad as well. The deskitself is magnetic. So, it's got allthose features just like its competitor.As well, you can buy various accessoriesfor it including a headphone standholder as well that you can slide on theside of the desk. You've got twoprogrammable buttons, and I love thefact that it comes with these extrabuttons that control the lighting. Imean, it it really is completelycustomizable, and the fact that thatlighting can actually change dependingon what game you're playing or whatmusic you're playing just immerses youstraight into the desk setup, and Iabsolutely love that. Overall, this deskis aimed at gamers. So, if you are agamer and you're looking for a desk,this one is definitely one to check out.What do you think of the lights? I thinkthat's one of the main differences withothers. Well, it is cuz it's it'sactually very reactive to every move youmake in the game despite the game youplay. Yeah. It changes on everything.Let's go. Let's go. Let me chooseanother one. Boom. There we go. There wego. Lovely. Yeah. It's so nice with thelights. Yeah.Sniper light. Oh, now it's on. So, thelights actually do change with the game.Yeah, they they change the game. Eachshot, each death, each everything itchanges. So, now that you've had thisdesk for a while, would you recommend itto other people? I would actuallyrecommend it cuz even when I'm workingon it, I just press the button it goesup and I'm standing while I'm working,which is nice. Researching as well,studying. It's lovely, man. It sets themapart. It's truly a gaming desk in myeyes. Very compact. The length is goodfor a dual screen setup, plus to haveyour desktop on. And with everything,it's it's a very respectable desk and avery nice one as well. I would recommendit to other people as well. I reallylike the chair to be honest cuz when I'mgaming with the with the cushion lumbarsupport and it just changes the game.I'm straight. I'm sitting straight. I'mplaying. There's no discomfort. There'sno pain in my bones. And if I just gettired of it, I can just, you know, thereyou go. Goes down and I'm back in actionagain. Thank you so much for watching.If you made it this far, of course,smash that like button, give me asubscribe, and um let me know if youwant me to do any more of these or ifyou have any more questions about thisdesk. Again, thank you so much toBlacklight for sponsoring this video.Honestly, it's a good desk. It's areally, really good desk. And if you'relooking for a gaming desk, one with alot of lights, like I said, definitelylook at this one. I'll catch you in thenext one. Bye.[Music]","Oh… oh my…. I love those corner pieces.

Loved the stealthy vibe of the setup. Great video bro

Hi Peter, you have quality videos! Love it. 

I just wanna ask, I scroll down on your feed. I can see that you had your Sihoo V1 then replaced it with Sihoo Doro then started using gaming chair. I love my secret lab but somehow my blood circulation on my leg is the problem, so i've been searching for a perfect chair (budget friendly) to have my back up during long hours. I've been eyeing this Sihoo V1 chair, may I ask why you shifted to Doro then lastly to Secretlab? 

Your response is a huge help. Thank you so much!

First up is the AM8Ti mic. I got this 2 years ago. It isstill my main mic. Aestheticallybeautiful. You can attach it to a mixerbecause it is XLR and USB compatible.This is many people's beginner micbecause it's so cheap and providesquality sound. And Fifine has their ownlowprofile boomark. I have both the veryexpensive one from Elgato as well as theone from Fifine. The only difference Inoticed is that the Elgato one cablemanagement log is magnetic. It does makeit very easy to like play around withyour cables, but if you're not going totouch it, who cares? Low profile armsare so nice because you don't hog up somuch desk space. As you can see, it fitsperfectly under my monitor. This is agas spring mount, and I definitelyrecommend those over other ones becauseyou can adjust it any way you want.

And it might justbe the best budget setup I've everbuilt. Getting started, as you guys cansee, we have so many items right herefor this setup. And it's literally only$700, like I said, and it's amazing. So,yeah, I'm actually just going to go overthe peripherals first. Um, right hereactually is the Nubo Gio6 headset. I'veactually done like a short video onthis, and this headset is actuallyreally good. It's literally less than$30. It's like wireless or you can dowired and it just has a bunch of optionsthat are really, really good for theprice. But yeah, taking it out of thebox, as you guys can see, we got all ofthis stuff for the headset right there.It also comes wrapped in two differentthings. And then right here, we canactually get the headset out and you canjust see for yourselves. Like it justlooks really good, but you can't reallyexpect that much. And it's supercomfortable. Like literally, it alsolooks pretty good, I think. And for aheadset, it's definitely not bad by anymeans. And then next up, we actually gota white mouse as well. And right here isthe Razer Essential Mouse from Amazon.It's literally I think less than $20,but it's a super super clean mouse asyou guys can see. Honestly, I have usedit before actually, but it is reallygood and it's only 20 bucks. And forthis setup that we're building, guys,right around $700. Like, I'm telling youguys, everything in here you're going toenjoy a lot if you choose to get ityourself. And then next up, we're goingto go with the keyboard. And this isalso a white theme. And as you guys cansee, we have a lot of white peripheralsright here. Um, that is on purpose. Thesetup is going to look really good, likeI said. But yeah, this is the TK68SEon Amazon. Literally right around $20.And when I tell you guys you can'treally spend $20 anywhere else for akeyboard besides right here, I mean it.Like literally, this has red switches.You guys can hear it. It also comes withthis detachable cable along with akeycap puller that clearly works as youguys can see. And then you can also justtake a look at the red switches rightthere. I was cleaning up some old filesthe other day and I accidentally deleteda folder with all of my old videos init. And I thought that I was deletingjust temporary files and stuff, but itwas actual footage that I needed. Andyeah, it was completely gone. Like noteven in the recycle bin or in any backupfiles. It was literally gone. So I endedup using this software calledWondershare Recover It. And somehow itbrought everything back. It was theoriginal full quality file. There waslike no corruption or weird glitches. Itwas like they were never even deleted inthe first place. I honestly don't knowhow the software recovered the files,but I'm so glad it did. It works withover 1,000 different file types,including videos, photos, and projectfiles, and can even recover fromexternal drives, SD cards, or even crashsystems. It's super easy to use, and itactually shows you a little previewbefore you recover anything, which isvery nice. But yeah, if you've everdeleted files by accident or lostanything due to crashing, recover itmight actually save you. I'm going toleave a link in the description if youguys are interested in getting it, butit definitely helped me. But yeah, Imean, it's really solid. Like usually,like I remember years ago, mechanicalkeyboards used to cost a lot more.Literally only cost 20 bucks if not alittle less than that. And next up, weactually have a mic. So, we do actuallyhave a mic in this setup. It wouldn'treally be a complete gaming setup. Imean, I know the uh headset does have amic on it, and it actually is prettydecent, but you know, having a dedicatedmic is always great. And, you know, yourvoice sounds crisp and clear. Like, eventhough we don't necessarily need onebecause this headset does literally havea mic on it and it works pretty decent.Um, you know, it's in the budget. It'swithin 700 bucks, so why not get it? Imean, you guys can spend this anywhereelse if you want to, like for a monitorarm or something, but I'm going to showyou guys this mic. This is the FifineAM8 microphone. Very, very good quality.I'm not going to lie. Put on the bassjust like that. And the whole thing doeslight up as you guys will see a littlebit later on. But yeah, this is the micright here. Like I said, it's a verygood budget microphone. Literally, Idon't know what else you could getbetter for around that price. Yeah, italso does come with a detachable cablejust like the uh keyboard did and theheadset actually. So, the only thingwithout a detachable cable here isliterally the mouse, which is prettyfunny. Yeah. Now, finally, we can get onto the more interesting part of this uhsetup right here, which is the monitor.And this is a Titan Army 144 hertzgaming monitor. It is 24 1/2 in. So,definitely a pretty decent size.Although, you can probably find onethat's 27 in. This one is under $100.So, I mean, for the budget, this is likea really good monitor. And we're goingto be able to see 144 FPS on this thing.So definitely not bad at all, especiallywith the computer we're getting, whichI'll actually go over right now. And Iam going to have to unbox it cuz it isbrand new in the box. As you guys cansee, it is always hard to get thesethings out of the box sitting down. SoI'm going to have to make you guys widerand take it out this way. But yeah,before I take it out, it is fromBlackout Computers. It is the Eclipsegaming PC. So we'll take this out. Firstthing that you guys see in the boxthough is just a couple of things. Thisis like a troubleshoot guide right here.This right here is some otheraccessories, I'm pretty sure. And thenwe have the PC. It is literally alwaysso difficult with one arm. Well, if thecomputer doesn't perform very good inthis video, I think I know why. But mybad, guys. But I was going to say thatI'm just going to put it upside down soit can actually come out pretty easy.So, there we go. Get that box out ofhere. It does have a lot of packagingaround it, so it's definitely not goingto be damaged or anything like that.Dude, I am dropping everything rightnow. There we go. We finally get thelast piece of packaging open. Andactually not the last piece ofpackaging, but you guys can see theaesthetic of this computer actuallylooks really good. The funny thing iswith all these white peripherals, we dohave a black PC, but it's funny cuz theydo actually have a white version of thisPC as well. And I'm pretty sure it'slike the same price, but I didn't wantto get everything white, you know. Uh wealso do have a black mic, so it kind ofhelps it. But yeah, this is the PC. I'lltake the packaging out and show you guysthe RGB.Dude, this song is stuck in my head,guys. Hold on. I have to play it for asecond. Hopefully I don't getcopyrighted. I'll play it for like 1second. I'm going to play like literallylike one second of it cuz I don't want achance to get copyrighted. Butthat song right there, you guys knowwhat I'm talking about. Anyways, back tothe PC. It's actually not even like asong. It's like a remix that someonemade in like whatever software they callit on PC that they make music and beats,whatever. This is the packaging righthere. Go ahead and take this out. Andguys, if I if there was like a recordfor how much packaging you can have in aPC for it not to get damaged, I swearit's literally this PC right here. Butyeah, looks very good. Hold on. Let meplug it in. All right, it's all pluggedin right now. So, we can actually powerit on hopefully. Power supply. My myfault. Rookie mistake. All right, so nowit's actually plugged in. We can turn iton. And yeah, you guys can see the RGBon it definitely looks uh like prettygood. Again, it's literally only $500.And this PC's actually been on sale alot. So, like for $450 and stuff. Um,all black as you guys can see. Even theGPU, like if we zoom in, even the GPUhas this like back plate on it thatmakes it look really good. And the wholething just all blacked out. Sodefinitely really good aesthetically.Yeah, obviously aesthetics aren'teverything in a computer and youdefinitely want the specs to be prettydecent for what you're paying for. Sothis PC right here actually does have anRX 580 GPU. Um, very decent, especiallyfor 1080p gaming and for a pre-builtcomputer under $500. It also has twosticks of 16 GB of RAM as well as a 1TBTE SSD and an i74790CPU. And instantly you guys are probablylike, ""That's a really old CPU."" Buthonestly, this CPU handles gaming prettywell, especially like low settings 1080pgames. Definitely pretty well still in2025. Um, and you can't literally gosearch for yourself on Amazon right nowand try to find one that's much betterthan this for $500. Like, you literallycan't for pre-built gaming PCs. And youguys will see later on in this video,like you still get well over 100 FPS andthere's not really many issues at all. Ido want to go over these right here.These have been here the whole time andI forgot to go over them, but these aremy own mouse pads which we will be usingfor the setup. They are only 25 bucksand they just make the entire setup. Anysetup you have looks so much better. Um,but yeah, only $25. They're my owncustom mouse pads. I have a ton ofdesigns like this black one, this darkblue swirl one, this light blue swirlone, this white swirl one, and a bunchof other designs. Um, I'm not sureexactly which one to use for this setup.Maybe the white one. I don't know. Yeah.Also, if you guys do want one of thesemouse pads and you don't want one of thedesigns that are already out, you cancustomize your own literally bycustomizing, meaning I can makeliterally anything you can think aboutand put it on a mouse pad for you foryou to buy at no extra charge at all.So, it'll still be $25 if you just joinmy Discord and DM me actually willing tobuy it. So, yeah, definitely very good.They're very big and comfortable as youguys can see. But, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonnastop talking about everything and justgo ahead and get right into the gamingpart of this video and show you guys theentire setup all set up.All right, guys. We got everything setup right here. I also just want toquickly show you guys the microphonequality. So, I'll go over to switch toit right now. And as you guys can hear,it's a pretty good mic. Like I'm saying,the Fifine AM8 microphone. Definitelynot a bad choice at all if you'relooking to get into it. And thenobviously you have a bunch of uhlighting effects right here as you guyscan see while you're rotating throughthem. So yeah, it's a definitely apretty decent mic. Yeah, we're going togo ahead and get right into this game.The first game we're going to be playingis War Zone. I think we're going to beable to get pretty decent FPS. I'mhoping over 60, but there's only one wayto find out. So, let's go ahead and loadin. Right off the start loading in,we're literally getting 80 FPS. This isso good, dude. 60 FPS. Over 60 ishonestly insane. Like, anything over 60is great. There's like there's nostutters either. So, this is like apretty solid 60 fps. Not a stuttery 60fps, if that makes any sense. Oh my,dude. He scared me so bad because I wasjust about to say something. My mind wasnot in the game at all. I haveheadphones that are studio headphonesliterally cost like over $150. The DT990Pros. So, I know what good headphonesare and these are good like and I alsoknow what bad headphones are. Like Ihave like some Senzor SG500 cheap budgetheadsets and this is a really budgetheadset and it's also wireless and it'sreally good sound quality.[Music]Take him out. Oh my god, he just gotfaked out so bad. He just got faked outso bad, guys. Y'all saw that. Y'all sawthat IQ. I know y'all did. Let's go.Another person.He want the smoke as well, man. Hey,come and get it. Come and get it. Oneafter the other. Clearly, you guys cansee I'm having no issues playing thisgame at all. I don't even play War Zone,but I do know that I am able to, sothat's really what matters. Oh, out ofthe sky. Oh, you're lucky.[Music]Oh, I thought I was going to respond, soI didn't even say anything. I wasn'teven going to show that in the video.But hey, we got enough gameplay, Iguess. But yeah, anyway, we're going togo and get to the next game. I'm prettysure this PC can run a lot of games, sowe're going to find out. All right,guys. We just loaded into Valerant rightnow. I don't even know how much FPSwe're going to get. Over well, we'reaveraging 200 FPS in Valerant. That isamazing.Able to bop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.Dang it. Yeah, that's why we don't pullout our knives. Okay, guys. That's whywe don't pull out our knives. But thisis just a warm-up anyway. But over 200,like around 200 FPS is very good on likemy gameplay. Hold on. Let me redeemmyself. Let me redeem myself. Let meredeem myself. Come on. Let me redeemmyself.Okay. Kind of. There we go. That's alittle better. We're getting We'regaining on it. We're gaining on it alittle bit.We're gaining on it a little bit.[Music]But yeah, I mean, this is great. Likethis is PC is a pre-built PC. If youdon't want to build one or get a usedone, this pre-built computer, look atour FPS right now. 230. Like, not bad,man. Not bad at all. Wait, my Oh, comeon. Wow. I almost just had a lisp thereand I don't even have a lisp. There wego. Both them. Should I just talk like Ihave a list for the rest of the video?Come on, man.I guess not, guys.Bop,[Music]two, one.I'm all Forn. Oh, wait. I'm all Forn.Yeah, we're going into a different gamenow. Um, Fortnite. Why not Fortnite?Let's see how that runs. Uh, I have highhopes. It is an all black creative mapas you guys can see. Um, we are gettingLooks like the peak FPS we got was 280FPS in creative. I wonder like is thatchanges the more we go out or something?I don't know. Yeah, 280. I saw 280 max.Not bad at all. There's also literallyno input delay on this keyboard at all.Like I'm telling you guys, I can buildand I feel no input delay. This keyboardis really solid and it also feels reallygood. Those other games I wasn't likeable to use it super fast cuz they'renot, you know, super fast-paced games.But everything right now is amazing.Definitely worth the $700 in my opinion.literally everything I'm using.Literally no issues whatsoever. Likeyeah, I'm g just go ahead and take thisinto a game. We're averaging 200 FPSwhile building and stuff in creative,which is insane. So, let's see if we canget hopefully we can average around 120to 144 in game, especially with the 144hertz monitor. But yeah. All right,guys. I can't even stress this enough.We're getting 150 while we are literallygliding down. Like, that's amazing.There's people all over us, though,which I do not like. He's literallycamping somewhere. But look at the FPS,guys. Just take a moment to look atthat. That is so good. I need to getout. I don't have mats. Sorry. Oh mygosh. What an escape.I do not have mats to fight anybodyright now, unfortunately.Okay, spray and pray. Spray and prayworks sometimes, and that was sometimes.So, let's go. Oh my gosh, he's low. AndI'm getting third party. That is notgood. That is not good.[Applause][Music]6464 Okay, nice. No way. No way, brother.No way. I'm getting shot at someone. Ihave nowhere to land now, guys. Thismight be wraps. This is probably wraps.I don't know why the whole lobby istargeting me right now. I have nothing.Isbox them.Oh my goodness. That was such a goodkill, dude. Dude. Oh my goodness. He hada spaz as well. If he just hit me, wewere dead. What am I doing? Oh my gosh.I did not mean to do that.If he literally just hit me, we weredead there. What a kill.Oh my gosh. There's no way. There'sabsolutely zero way possible that justhappened. Oh my goodness. We are likethat. I'm telling you, that purple spatsaved me. I hit him for like 190.I don't know what to tell you guys, butthis PC seems to be fine. Didn't shoot.We're dead. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Wecouldn't win. My shotgun just didn'tshoot when I looked at him, cuz we wouldhave killed him there. I'm not going tolie. But yeah, this PC is very good. umover 144 fps consistently ishonestly that that exceeded myexpectations for this PC, but clearly itcan run some games. I'm going to do afew games super quickly just to show youguys how they run. But Fortnite,definitely check that one off the listas well. All right, guys. Rocket League,I'll show you guys the settings in asecond, but it's definitely runnable aswell. Like, it's not surprising thatit's runnable. Literally, all the othergames were. And this game does not taketoo much at all. So you guys can seethat uh if we go to here, this is mysettings. And honestly, like on anysingle PC, this is still the settingsI'm going to use in Rocket League, justcuz I don't like playing in highsettings on a game like this, just cuz,you know, the competitive advantage islow settings. Um, even in Rocket League,but I will show you guys what highsettings does look like and how itperforms. All right, so I'm going applythese settings right here. You guys cantake a look at them if you know RocketLeague. I guess they already appliedthat quick. Wow. Okay. I wasn'texpecting the PC to be that fast, butwe're still getting like the same FPS.Wow, that's actually kind of crazy.We're getting still 160 in RocketLeague. No issues at all. Definitelylooks good for the enjoyment of thegame. Not for competitive reasons,though. That's just how I've alwaysbeen. But yeah, we're going to go intothe next game. I'm going to show youguys Minecraft and how much FPSMinecraft can get. But all of thesegames are runnable. Like it seems ifthey're not AAA games, you're going tobe able to run them perfectly fine. Andeven some AAA games you can probablyrun. All right, I'm making a new worldright now. We see how fast it loads up.That's loaded in. We are getting over400 FPS. Wow. I mean, that is notsurprising, honestly. Almost 500. So,you can definitely run this game withsome high quality shaders. I'll show youguys my settings right now. This isthem. All right. Now, my thing. I alwayswant to test out maximum FPS. So, let'sgo. Whoa. Hold on. If we just look righthere.All right. 1,00 FPS. All right. Thatthat Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.Blackout PC. I was looking for somehorse armor or something, but look, morediamonds right here. More diamonds righthere. Wow,what a cave. What a cave. I think wejust sell more diamonds as well, maybe.All right, at the bottom of the worldright now. I really just want to see howmuch FPS we get looking down at it. Allright, so Minecraft FPS on this computermaximum 1343. I saw 1473. 1473 is thehighest FPS we can get in Minecraft. Idon't know why. I just wanted to dothat. But that's insane. I really don'thave any other games to really test foryou guys cuz most of you guys haveprobably played one of those gamesbefore and you know how good thecomputer is basing it off of that. Butyeah, I'm going go and go to the outroand tell you guys my final thoughts. Allright, so $700 and we're getting thisright here. Yeah, I'm not going to lie,that's a very good deal. Literally theonly thing you can do better is the PCby building one or buying one used. Butyou guys saw the performance. Like it'snot bad at all for a pre-built.Instantly people assume when you heari74790 it's so old 10 years old. Butyeah, but like how much FPS we werestill getting though. For me it reallywasn't an issue at all to have some goodgameplay and you know entertain you guyswith it. Yeah. I mean taking a look foryourselves like you guys can just seethe aesthetics is also really good on itas well. It's not like it's just somecheap put together PC. It has a blackback plate on it as well. Two sticks of8 GB of RAM and yeah just overall verygood. Not to mention the greatmicrophone, amazing headset, keyboard,mouse, monitor, mouse pad especially.It's just simply that good in myopinion.All this stuff will be linked down belowin the description. And also, if you'vedeleted any of your old videos oranything that you want, make sure tocheck out recover it uh in thedescription. The link will be there.Definitely a very useful software. Butyeah, this right here is the uh verse ofthe day. You guys can read that righthere. Um, yeah, remember that Jesus doeswant a relationship with you guys. So,just make sure to look into that. And,uh, yeah, also check out the videos hereand here if you're interested. Um, verygood videos. And I'll see you guys nextone.

Bro is showcasing 580 prebuilts
Can you do a bunch of a gaming set up? 1500
Been here since 1K great to see you evolve to 30K
Hello Fluxphy, My name is Mohab, and I’m a 13-year-old boy from Canada. I’ve been a huge fan of Fortnite for years, but I’ve never had the chance to play on a real gaming PC. Right now, I play on a school Chromebook that I had to borrow, using GeForce Now Experience just to get into matches. It’s super laggy, and the delay makes it really hard to improve or even enjoy the game the way I want to. But I keep playing anyway because I love it so much.

I’ve entered tons of PC giveaways from different content creators, hoping for a chance, but I’ve never won any of them. I know there are so many people out there asking too, and I don’t want to seem like I’m begging—but for someone like me, who comes from a family that can’t really afford something like a gaming setup, it would honestly mean the world.

Gaming is more than just fun to me—it’s where I feel the most confident, and it helps me escape when things get tough. You’ve already helped so many people, and even if nothing happens, just being able to message you gives me a little hope. Thank you so much for always being generous and inspiring so many kids like me to keep dreaming.
you improve day by day, underrated af
if you want more fps with an RX 580 you need a Ryxen 5 5400 or 5 5600
for 400 dollars that isnt a bad pc 80 fps on MW3?
I can get the pc?
I would get this computer, I'm not a pc gamer but it's good enough for my photography. One problem though, it uses windows 10 and I'm pretty sure it can't be upgraded to Windows 11. It's a shame because the price it good as well.

And it might justbe the best budget setup I've everbuilt. Getting started, as you guys cansee, we have so many items right herefor this setup. And it's literally only$700, like I said, and it's amazing. So,yeah, I'm actually just going to go overthe peripherals first. Um, right hereactually is the Nubo Gio6 headset. I'veactually done like a short video onthis, and this headset is actuallyreally good. It's literally less than$30. It's like wireless or you can dowired and it just has a bunch of optionsthat are really, really good for theprice. But yeah, taking it out of thebox, as you guys can see, we got all ofthis stuff for the headset right there.It also comes wrapped in two differentthings. And then right here, we canactually get the headset out and you canjust see for yourselves. Like it justlooks really good, but you can't reallyexpect that much. And it's supercomfortable. Like literally, it alsolooks pretty good, I think. And for aheadset, it's definitely not bad by anymeans. And then next up, we actually gota white mouse as well. And right here isthe Razer Essential Mouse from Amazon.It's literally I think less than $20,but it's a super super clean mouse asyou guys can see. Honestly, I have usedit before actually, but it is reallygood and it's only 20 bucks. And forthis setup that we're building, guys,right around $700. Like, I'm telling youguys, everything in here you're going toenjoy a lot if you choose to get ityourself. And then next up, we're goingto go with the keyboard. And this isalso a white theme. And as you guys cansee, we have a lot of white peripheralsright here. Um, that is on purpose. Thesetup is going to look really good, likeI said. But yeah, this is the TK68SEon Amazon. Literally right around $20.And when I tell you guys you can'treally spend $20 anywhere else for akeyboard besides right here, I mean it.Like literally, this has red switches.You guys can hear it. It also comes withthis detachable cable along with akeycap puller that clearly works as youguys can see. And then you can also justtake a look at the red switches rightthere. I was cleaning up some old filesthe other day and I accidentally deleteda folder with all of my old videos init. And I thought that I was deletingjust temporary files and stuff, but itwas actual footage that I needed. Andyeah, it was completely gone. Like noteven in the recycle bin or in any backupfiles. It was literally gone. So I endedup using this software calledWondershare Recover It. And somehow itbrought everything back. It was theoriginal full quality file. There waslike no corruption or weird glitches. Itwas like they were never even deleted inthe first place. I honestly don't knowhow the software recovered the files,but I'm so glad it did. It works withover 1,000 different file types,including videos, photos, and projectfiles, and can even recover fromexternal drives, SD cards, or even crashsystems. It's super easy to use, and itactually shows you a little previewbefore you recover anything, which isvery nice. But yeah, if you've everdeleted files by accident or lostanything due to crashing, recover itmight actually save you. I'm going toleave a link in the description if youguys are interested in getting it, butit definitely helped me. But yeah, Imean, it's really solid. Like usually,like I remember years ago, mechanicalkeyboards used to cost a lot more.Literally only cost 20 bucks if not alittle less than that. And next up, weactually have a mic. So, we do actuallyhave a mic in this setup. It wouldn'treally be a complete gaming setup. Imean, I know the uh headset does have amic on it, and it actually is prettydecent, but you know, having a dedicatedmic is always great. And, you know, yourvoice sounds crisp and clear. Like, eventhough we don't necessarily need onebecause this headset does literally havea mic on it and it works pretty decent.Um, you know, it's in the budget. It'swithin 700 bucks, so why not get it? Imean, you guys can spend this anywhereelse if you want to, like for a monitorarm or something, but I'm going to showyou guys this mic. This is the FifineAM8 microphone. Very, very good quality.I'm not going to lie. Put on the bassjust like that. And the whole thing doeslight up as you guys will see a littlebit later on. But yeah, this is the micright here. Like I said, it's a verygood budget microphone. Literally, Idon't know what else you could getbetter for around that price. Yeah, italso does come with a detachable cablejust like the uh keyboard did and theheadset actually. So, the only thingwithout a detachable cable here isliterally the mouse, which is prettyfunny. Yeah. Now, finally, we can get onto the more interesting part of this uhsetup right here, which is the monitor.And this is a Titan Army 144 hertzgaming monitor. It is 24 1/2 in. So,definitely a pretty decent size.Although, you can probably find onethat's 27 in. This one is under $100.So, I mean, for the budget, this is likea really good monitor. And we're goingto be able to see 144 FPS on this thing.So definitely not bad at all, especiallywith the computer we're getting, whichI'll actually go over right now. And Iam going to have to unbox it cuz it isbrand new in the box. As you guys cansee, it is always hard to get thesethings out of the box sitting down. SoI'm going to have to make you guys widerand take it out this way. But yeah,before I take it out, it is fromBlackout Computers. It is the Eclipsegaming PC. So we'll take this out. Firstthing that you guys see in the boxthough is just a couple of things. Thisis like a troubleshoot guide right here.This right here is some otheraccessories, I'm pretty sure. And thenwe have the PC. It is literally alwaysso difficult with one arm. Well, if thecomputer doesn't perform very good inthis video, I think I know why. But mybad, guys. But I was going to say thatI'm just going to put it upside down soit can actually come out pretty easy.So, there we go. Get that box out ofhere. It does have a lot of packagingaround it, so it's definitely not goingto be damaged or anything like that.Dude, I am dropping everything rightnow. There we go. We finally get thelast piece of packaging open. Andactually not the last piece ofpackaging, but you guys can see theaesthetic of this computer actuallylooks really good. The funny thing iswith all these white peripherals, we dohave a black PC, but it's funny cuz theydo actually have a white version of thisPC as well. And I'm pretty sure it'slike the same price, but I didn't wantto get everything white, you know. Uh wealso do have a black mic, so it kind ofhelps it. But yeah, this is the PC. I'lltake the packaging out and show you guysthe RGB.Dude, this song is stuck in my head,guys. Hold on. I have to play it for asecond. Hopefully I don't getcopyrighted. I'll play it for like 1second. I'm going to play like literallylike one second of it cuz I don't want achance to get copyrighted. Butthat song right there, you guys knowwhat I'm talking about. Anyways, back tothe PC. It's actually not even like asong. It's like a remix that someonemade in like whatever software they callit on PC that they make music and beats,whatever. This is the packaging righthere. Go ahead and take this out. Andguys, if I if there was like a recordfor how much packaging you can have in aPC for it not to get damaged, I swearit's literally this PC right here. Butyeah, looks very good. Hold on. Let meplug it in. All right, it's all pluggedin right now. So, we can actually powerit on hopefully. Power supply. My myfault. Rookie mistake. All right, so nowit's actually plugged in. We can turn iton. And yeah, you guys can see the RGBon it definitely looks uh like prettygood. Again, it's literally only $500.And this PC's actually been on sale alot. So, like for $450 and stuff. Um,all black as you guys can see. Even theGPU, like if we zoom in, even the GPUhas this like back plate on it thatmakes it look really good. And the wholething just all blacked out. Sodefinitely really good aesthetically.Yeah, obviously aesthetics aren'teverything in a computer and youdefinitely want the specs to be prettydecent for what you're paying for. Sothis PC right here actually does have anRX 580 GPU. Um, very decent, especiallyfor 1080p gaming and for a pre-builtcomputer under $500. It also has twosticks of 16 GB of RAM as well as a 1TBTE SSD and an i74790CPU. And instantly you guys are probablylike, ""That's a really old CPU."" Buthonestly, this CPU handles gaming prettywell, especially like low settings 1080pgames. Definitely pretty well still in2025. Um, and you can't literally gosearch for yourself on Amazon right nowand try to find one that's much betterthan this for $500. Like, you literallycan't for pre-built gaming PCs. And youguys will see later on in this video,like you still get well over 100 FPS andthere's not really many issues at all. Ido want to go over these right here.These have been here the whole time andI forgot to go over them, but these aremy own mouse pads which we will be usingfor the setup. They are only 25 bucksand they just make the entire setup. Anysetup you have looks so much better. Um,but yeah, only $25. They're my owncustom mouse pads. I have a ton ofdesigns like this black one, this darkblue swirl one, this light blue swirlone, this white swirl one, and a bunchof other designs. Um, I'm not sureexactly which one to use for this setup.Maybe the white one. I don't know. Yeah.Also, if you guys do want one of thesemouse pads and you don't want one of thedesigns that are already out, you cancustomize your own literally bycustomizing, meaning I can makeliterally anything you can think aboutand put it on a mouse pad for you foryou to buy at no extra charge at all.So, it'll still be $25 if you just joinmy Discord and DM me actually willing tobuy it. So, yeah, definitely very good.They're very big and comfortable as youguys can see. But, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonnastop talking about everything and justgo ahead and get right into the gamingpart of this video and show you guys theentire setup all set up.All right, guys. We got everything setup right here. I also just want toquickly show you guys the microphonequality. So, I'll go over to switch toit right now. And as you guys can hear,it's a pretty good mic. Like I'm saying,the Fifine AM8 microphone. Definitelynot a bad choice at all if you'relooking to get into it. And thenobviously you have a bunch of uhlighting effects right here as you guyscan see while you're rotating throughthem. So yeah, it's a definitely apretty decent mic. Yeah, we're going togo ahead and get right into this game.The first game we're going to be playingis War Zone. I think we're going to beable to get pretty decent FPS. I'mhoping over 60, but there's only one wayto find out. So, let's go ahead and loadin. Right off the start loading in,we're literally getting 80 FPS. This isso good, dude. 60 FPS. Over 60 ishonestly insane. Like, anything over 60is great. There's like there's nostutters either. So, this is like apretty solid 60 fps. Not a stuttery 60fps, if that makes any sense. Oh my,dude. He scared me so bad because I wasjust about to say something. My mind wasnot in the game at all. I haveheadphones that are studio headphonesliterally cost like over $150. The DT990Pros. So, I know what good headphonesare and these are good like and I alsoknow what bad headphones are. Like Ihave like some Senzor SG500 cheap budgetheadsets and this is a really budgetheadset and it's also wireless and it'sreally good sound quality.[Music]Take him out. Oh my god, he just gotfaked out so bad. He just got faked outso bad, guys. Y'all saw that. Y'all sawthat IQ. I know y'all did. Let's go.Another person.He want the smoke as well, man. Hey,come and get it. Come and get it. Oneafter the other. Clearly, you guys cansee I'm having no issues playing thisgame at all. I don't even play War Zone,but I do know that I am able to, sothat's really what matters. Oh, out ofthe sky. Oh, you're lucky.[Music]Oh, I thought I was going to respond, soI didn't even say anything. I wasn'teven going to show that in the video.But hey, we got enough gameplay, Iguess. But yeah, anyway, we're going togo and get to the next game. I'm prettysure this PC can run a lot of games, sowe're going to find out. All right,guys. We just loaded into Valerant rightnow. I don't even know how much FPSwe're going to get. Over well, we'reaveraging 200 FPS in Valerant. That isamazing.Able to bop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.Dang it. Yeah, that's why we don't pullout our knives. Okay, guys. That's whywe don't pull out our knives. But thisis just a warm-up anyway. But over 200,like around 200 FPS is very good on likemy gameplay. Hold on. Let me redeemmyself. Let me redeem myself. Let meredeem myself. Come on. Let me redeemmyself.Okay. Kind of. There we go. That's alittle better. We're getting We'regaining on it. We're gaining on it alittle bit.We're gaining on it a little bit.[Music]But yeah, I mean, this is great. Likethis is PC is a pre-built PC. If youdon't want to build one or get a usedone, this pre-built computer, look atour FPS right now. 230. Like, not bad,man. Not bad at all. Wait, my Oh, comeon. Wow. I almost just had a lisp thereand I don't even have a lisp. There wego. Both them. Should I just talk like Ihave a list for the rest of the video?Come on, man.I guess not, guys.Bop,[Music]two, one.I'm all Forn. Oh, wait. I'm all Forn.Yeah, we're going into a different gamenow. Um, Fortnite. Why not Fortnite?Let's see how that runs. Uh, I have highhopes. It is an all black creative mapas you guys can see. Um, we are gettingLooks like the peak FPS we got was 280FPS in creative. I wonder like is thatchanges the more we go out or something?I don't know. Yeah, 280. I saw 280 max.Not bad at all. There's also literallyno input delay on this keyboard at all.Like I'm telling you guys, I can buildand I feel no input delay. This keyboardis really solid and it also feels reallygood. Those other games I wasn't likeable to use it super fast cuz they'renot, you know, super fast-paced games.But everything right now is amazing.Definitely worth the $700 in my opinion.literally everything I'm using.Literally no issues whatsoever. Likeyeah, I'm g just go ahead and take thisinto a game. We're averaging 200 FPSwhile building and stuff in creative,which is insane. So, let's see if we canget hopefully we can average around 120to 144 in game, especially with the 144hertz monitor. But yeah. All right,guys. I can't even stress this enough.We're getting 150 while we are literallygliding down. Like, that's amazing.There's people all over us, though,which I do not like. He's literallycamping somewhere. But look at the FPS,guys. Just take a moment to look atthat. That is so good. I need to getout. I don't have mats. Sorry. Oh mygosh. What an escape.I do not have mats to fight anybodyright now, unfortunately.Okay, spray and pray. Spray and prayworks sometimes, and that was sometimes.So, let's go. Oh my gosh, he's low. AndI'm getting third party. That is notgood. That is not good.[Applause][Music]6464 Okay, nice. No way. No way, brother.No way. I'm getting shot at someone. Ihave nowhere to land now, guys. Thismight be wraps. This is probably wraps.I don't know why the whole lobby istargeting me right now. I have nothing.Isbox them.Oh my goodness. That was such a goodkill, dude. Dude. Oh my goodness. He hada spaz as well. If he just hit me, wewere dead. What am I doing? Oh my gosh.I did not mean to do that.If he literally just hit me, we weredead there. What a kill.Oh my gosh. There's no way. There'sabsolutely zero way possible that justhappened. Oh my goodness. We are likethat. I'm telling you, that purple spatsaved me. I hit him for like 190.I don't know what to tell you guys, butthis PC seems to be fine. Didn't shoot.We're dead. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Wecouldn't win. My shotgun just didn'tshoot when I looked at him, cuz we wouldhave killed him there. I'm not going tolie. But yeah, this PC is very good. umover 144 fps consistently ishonestly that that exceeded myexpectations for this PC, but clearly itcan run some games. I'm going to do afew games super quickly just to show youguys how they run. But Fortnite,definitely check that one off the listas well. All right, guys. Rocket League,I'll show you guys the settings in asecond, but it's definitely runnable aswell. Like, it's not surprising thatit's runnable. Literally, all the othergames were. And this game does not taketoo much at all. So you guys can seethat uh if we go to here, this is mysettings. And honestly, like on anysingle PC, this is still the settingsI'm going to use in Rocket League, justcuz I don't like playing in highsettings on a game like this, just cuz,you know, the competitive advantage islow settings. Um, even in Rocket League,but I will show you guys what highsettings does look like and how itperforms. All right, so I'm going applythese settings right here. You guys cantake a look at them if you know RocketLeague. I guess they already appliedthat quick. Wow. Okay. I wasn'texpecting the PC to be that fast, butwe're still getting like the same FPS.Wow, that's actually kind of crazy.We're getting still 160 in RocketLeague. No issues at all. Definitelylooks good for the enjoyment of thegame. Not for competitive reasons,though. That's just how I've alwaysbeen. But yeah, we're going to go intothe next game. I'm going to show youguys Minecraft and how much FPSMinecraft can get. But all of thesegames are runnable. Like it seems ifthey're not AAA games, you're going tobe able to run them perfectly fine. Andeven some AAA games you can probablyrun. All right, I'm making a new worldright now. We see how fast it loads up.That's loaded in. We are getting over400 FPS. Wow. I mean, that is notsurprising, honestly. Almost 500. So,you can definitely run this game withsome high quality shaders. I'll show youguys my settings right now. This isthem. All right. Now, my thing. I alwayswant to test out maximum FPS. So, let'sgo. Whoa. Hold on. If we just look righthere.All right. 1,00 FPS. All right. Thatthat Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.Blackout PC. I was looking for somehorse armor or something, but look, morediamonds right here. More diamonds righthere. Wow,what a cave. What a cave. I think wejust sell more diamonds as well, maybe.All right, at the bottom of the worldright now. I really just want to see howmuch FPS we get looking down at it. Allright, so Minecraft FPS on this computermaximum 1343. I saw 1473. 1473 is thehighest FPS we can get in Minecraft. Idon't know why. I just wanted to dothat. But that's insane. I really don'thave any other games to really test foryou guys cuz most of you guys haveprobably played one of those gamesbefore and you know how good thecomputer is basing it off of that. Butyeah, I'm going go and go to the outroand tell you guys my final thoughts. Allright, so $700 and we're getting thisright here. Yeah, I'm not going to lie,that's a very good deal. Literally theonly thing you can do better is the PCby building one or buying one used. Butyou guys saw the performance. Like it'snot bad at all for a pre-built.Instantly people assume when you heari74790 it's so old 10 years old. Butyeah, but like how much FPS we werestill getting though. For me it reallywasn't an issue at all to have some goodgameplay and you know entertain you guyswith it. Yeah. I mean taking a look foryourselves like you guys can just seethe aesthetics is also really good on itas well. It's not like it's just somecheap put together PC. It has a blackback plate on it as well. Two sticks of8 GB of RAM and yeah just overall verygood. Not to mention the greatmicrophone, amazing headset, keyboard,mouse, monitor, mouse pad especially.It's just simply that good in myopinion.All this stuff will be linked down belowin the description. And also, if you'vedeleted any of your old videos oranything that you want, make sure tocheck out recover it uh in thedescription. The link will be there.Definitely a very useful software. Butyeah, this right here is the uh verse ofthe day. You guys can read that righthere. Um, yeah, remember that Jesus doeswant a relationship with you guys. So,just make sure to look into that. And,uh, yeah, also check out the videos hereand here if you're interested. Um, verygood videos. And I'll see you guys nextone.

Bro is showcasing 580 prebuilts
Can you do a bunch of a gaming set up? 1500
Been here since 1K great to see you evolve to 30K
Hello Fluxphy, My name is Mohab, and I’m a 13-year-old boy from Canada. I’ve been a huge fan of Fortnite for years, but I’ve never had the chance to play on a real gaming PC. Right now, I play on a school Chromebook that I had to borrow, using GeForce Now Experience just to get into matches. It’s super laggy, and the delay makes it really hard to improve or even enjoy the game the way I want to. But I keep playing anyway because I love it so much.

I’ve entered tons of PC giveaways from different content creators, hoping for a chance, but I’ve never won any of them. I know there are so many people out there asking too, and I don’t want to seem like I’m begging—but for someone like me, who comes from a family that can’t really afford something like a gaming setup, it would honestly mean the world.

Gaming is more than just fun to me—it’s where I feel the most confident, and it helps me escape when things get tough. You’ve already helped so many people, and even if nothing happens, just being able to message you gives me a little hope. Thank you so much for always being generous and inspiring so many kids like me to keep dreaming.
you improve day by day, underrated af
if you want more fps with an RX 580 you need a Ryxen 5 5400 or 5 5600
for 400 dollars that isnt a bad pc 80 fps on MW3?
I can get the pc?
I would get this computer, I'm not a pc gamer but it's good enough for my photography. One problem though, it uses windows 10 and I'm pretty sure it can't be upgraded to Windows 11. It's a shame because the price it good as well.

Bro found the most biggest loophole in history that is “if they hate looking at your face,just show them your gaming setup with your images on them”
Too funny

bro this is so relatable. Doing the ""checking-in""
I go up the stairs like that sometimes lol
When i grow up, I wanna be like Dino
Nah, he’s checking if he’s still allowed to sleep in the bedroom
The stair crawl is spot on, nice
He turn that staircase a catwalk
That walk back up there stairs says it all. I feel you
Putting hands on stairs while going up lmao i still do that sometimes
Ngl smthng primal about going up stairs on all fours
The walk back up the stairs is what does it all together lol using all fours for maximum efficiency
He make fence in his stair for protect his baby. What a responsible daddy gamer. Superb.
Bro is crawling back to his cave
A true man of classic stair walking indeed!
the pose is swag, but the crocs are hilarious
Goin up the stairs like a true gentleman
He should prepare her favourite snacks and drinks to fully 100% sure shes good
You still have the inner child in you. The vibe still vibing.
THE SWAG ️‍ THE SASS THE GOAT
Just me or did anyone else see his cheeks hanging out while he was going up the stairs
Bro out here walking like a supermodel , I wouldnt be surprised if he was one back then he has done it all after all
Lol. I can relate. It's a must. It is a message that I still care about you and ok you're fine, don't disturb me in my next match, lab yah!
Dude must be such a vibe to be around
I still don’t know why we do that, but it happens Checking-in just to say “Hi! Sup! Love you! Bye!”
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
checking in is part of main quest now for me
I would do the same thing
Relatable. Well actually, we check if they have things to remind us in case we forgot to throw out the garbage.
Did his pants fall down
That’s wasup ! sometimes people game and forgot about the real world so this is refreshing to see
I'm thankful for this versatile channel
my husband do checking on me after long game at his bat cave
I do this... finish one game, go check on the wife and kids with the obligatory ""need anything?"" Then go back to the PS5. Repeat every 2 - 3 games
Man nowadays I'm only gaming when both wifey and kid are asleep
Bro really on another level
That a good gamer and a good husband.

If your kid ask you if any chore needed to be done and do a patrol around the house before playing, that kid a good kid. Or this is just some asian stuff
I bet u don’t have a huge lego collection
The social check before a league launch, and then de 4 paw run up the stairs 1 min before start. Yea that's me
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Lol! I do check my wife before march starts too.
Checking on the fam while in deep game sessions is a must! You alive?? Good!
Maximum efficiency going up the stairs like that probably cause of that little model walk you gotta get back before the game starts!
Damn' u should wear the prada bag dino
I think dinos most feared scenario is electricity crisis..
Oh he's playing dota 2, long queues
Them wives who walk in the room chatting and know to say ""oh shit sorry you loading in rn? Oh you in the gulag...rah ima talk to you in a sec then..."" Or just ""is your mike on?""We know more game lingo than we'd care to learn but we also know it helps us work around it(if we aren't gamers ourselves lol)
Love is for luck. Most especially when you're always dead in FPS games.
pretty sure most of us climb the stairs like that
Guys do climb up stairs that way on occasion ngl
This channel is a variety show
The intermission mission
dinos the example of why they say marry a wife that understands and supports you
This dude’s shoulder height with the handrails
First Comment! - I also do this to check if I should play another game or not.
He is renewing his license to play like parking tickets
Im a pinoy, and literally i do the same thing. I guess is in our DNA
what is the best gaming laptop??brand
That was a zesty check-in
Was that an invite? If so. She took to long to decide.
He is wearing the same shorts for his entire life .
Cuz if shes chillin the next round finna be lit!
Dude this ""check-in"" is just filling the quota so you dont suddenly feel lonely and crash the game
Wait is it just me or while going up the stairs his shorts get pulled down
This is not a brat summer
He's the guy, checking fam is ol good before the match coz God knows when he'll be back.
LOL the crawl so the blood rush dosent end horribly going back up
What’s with the gate at the end of the stairs?
Loving it
Fantastic posing my man
This be me
Bro, why don't they get the you good before I go back to war check?
Dino cornel looks like super mario you need to cosplay

EVERYTIME THAT OMINOUS SOUND GOES OFF IM CALLING THE PERSON WHO MESSAGED THAT THE B WORD EVERY OMINOUS SOUND EVERY.::
Loved it bro. You just bring smile to my face no matter what
HunterxHunter playing casually in the background is such a vibe lol. Even in the chimera ant arc
Bro drying his hands everywhere
I felt like he just slapped my face
Dino lose all his calories in one go of a yt short
I was about to say.. No matter where you come from, the house is hers Lmaoo!!
If he just said ""nah, I ain't got it"" would be better
Bro did the classic ""This whole house is her gift."" Let's hope his wife don't see this.
When you realised that he has a whole manson apart from his gaming home for his wife
Bro forgot his child
0:23 cute dogy

Bro was gesticulating with all his might
Bro really the biggest gift he gave his wife is himself. I mean she literally married a living legend
I Love his humour
The best part is the hunterxhunter playing on tv
Those are not gifts. Most of them are household items
I have a quaistion what you do for living.
Not gonna lie, bro's gotta whole lot of whiskey collection. Love it
Dog: tf's happening bro
Except for bro's gadgets and toys, the whole house is actually for his wife. That's the mark of a true gentleman.
The baby as a gift
I say the same things to my wife, everything apart from the mattresses, pillow and my PC tables are all brought for you. I just need these three

I upload gaming tech reviews and share my gaming setup.","Hey guys, Moon Rider here. For today'svideo, I'm adding some streaming gear tothe gaming setup. And no, this isn't forthe sake of a review. I'm actually goingto start making gaming content on mysecond channel, which is something I'vebeen planning on doing for a while, butkept pushing it off for any reason myoverthinking brain could concoct. ButI'm not getting any younger, so today'sthe day I'm finally doing it. Also, I'vebeen thinking about switching out my PCcase, and today I started looking intosome options. I'll share those ideaswith you later on in the video. Allrighty, intro's over. Let's check outthat streaming gear. And I do usestreaming loosely because I'm notplanning on actually live streaming onYouTube or Twitch. I'll be recordinggameplay and editing the footage. Andbefore anyone in the comments suggestsit's more beneficial to live stream thanedit the footage, I totally agree, butI've got this whole hereditary facialtick thing going on that I'm notconfident enough to show off. So, thisis what I'll be adding into the setup.I've got the Emit S800 webcam, FifineSC3 audio mixer, and a newer productfrom Fifine, their Amplagame D6 streamcontroller. As much as I would love toreap the rewards from a DSLR camera, aproper one isn't in my budget. I have anold Canon EO70D, but it only shoots 60frames per second in 720 resolution and30 frames per second in 1080p.Meanwhile, I can get 60 frames persecond out of the S800 with 1080presolution or 30 frames per second with4K UHD. On top of that, the S800 isequipped with an 8 megapixel lens,half-in Sony sensor delivering f1.8aperture and focal length of 4.71 mm, aswell as smart features like phasedetection autofocus and time offlightdual autofocus that work in sync todeliver faster, more preciseautofocusing, which should be great whenI'm getting all hyper. It also has twoomniirectional microphones, but I won'tbe using those. All right, time to picka home. I really don't want this side ofmy room showing up in any of my contentreally. So, I'm going to position it ontop of my Edifier speaker. I just spend15 minutes searching for one of my oldmini tripods only to remember the S800can angle out from its stand and pivotand it's the perfect height for what Ineed. Next is the Fifine SC3 audiomixer. I know compared to other audiomixers, this one is more on the basicend of the spectrum. And that's totallyfine because for my intended purpose,I'm not looking for any advancedfeatures. All I'm going to use it for isplugging in my headset and monitoringthe mic. Meanwhile, the headset I willbe using is the wired Razer Black SharkV2X. Now, I adore this headset. I pickedit up from Target for $40 about 2 yearsago after purchasing my Series X. Itactually retails for $50, but isfrequently discounted to 40. It's sogood and so affordable, even my wifepicked one up. Anyway, the mic on thisbad boy is epic. I'm actually recordingvoice over through it right now. Itfeatures a hyper clear cardioidmicrophone offering greater speechpickup and noise cancellation, which I'mreally hoping will work for tuning outany keyboard smashing. Otherwise, Iwon't be able to use my Gravitar MercuryK1 light, which would be sad days. Butat least I have options. Now, the lastpiece of gear isn't as necessary as theother two, but I'm hoping it'll offersome convenience in the form of shortcutkeys. It's called the Amplame D6 StreamController, and it's Fifine's responseto the Elgato Stream Deck, which I neverowned or tested cuz I could neverjustify the $150 price tag. Meanwhile,Fifine Stream Controller sells foraround $80. So, around half the price ofthe Stream Deck, especially when it's onsale. Of course, I didn't buy this oneeither since Fifine sent it over for meto try out. So, let's get it set up andassign some shortcuts.I assigned shortcuts to my most visitedwebsites like YouTube and Upbeat where Iget all my music for videos.Productivity shortcuts like my YouTubechannel, Libre Office Writer, and myprojects folder. So, I'll be using twoprograms to record gameplay and facecam.OBS will be used for recording myfacecam and GeForce Experience forrecording gameplay. Real quick, let meexplain why I'm using two differentprograms instead of just OBS. I had agaming channel a few years ago and Iused OBS for both gameplay and facecamrecording. The problem was every once ina while OBS wouldn't record gameplayaudio or the audio would sound horriblydistorted and I would have no way ofknowing that was happening in real time.Even if I did an audio test run prior toplaying, the audio would record normallythe first time and the second time I'dhit record, it would get messed up and Iwouldn't know until playing it back anhour and a half or 2 hours later and allthat time would be wasted. I've neverhad issues recording my voice withFacecam with OBS and I've also neverexperienced issues recording gameplaywith GeForce Experience. So, that's whyI use both. That being said, I'm goingto try to set two of those shortcutbuttons to start and stop recording inOBS and GeForce Experience. and the tworemaining buttons can serve as shortcutsto opening up those programs. Let's seeif it can be done. So, this is Fifine'scontrol deck software. The drop-own menuon the right includes pre-installedDiscord, OBS, and Streamlab shortcuts,as well as various Toolbox, audioplayer, and Operational Flow shortcuts.The OBS dropdown doesn't seem to have anapp launcher shortcut, so I'll tryselecting the toolbox menu and draggingover open an app, then selecting OBSfrom the app name dropdown.When I try to drag record from the OBSdrop-own menu, it prompts me to enter aserver password, which I have no ideawhat that is. So, instead, I assigned akey combo shortcut within OBS to startand stop recording. By opening thetoolbox menu and dragging over hotkey, Ican assign left alt + zero. And when Ipress the button on the streamcontroller, OBS starts and stopsrecording. Now, I could probably do thesame thing for GeForce Experience, butsince it always seems to be accessibleby pressing left Alt + Z, I'll drag overhotkey from toolbox, assign left alt +Z, and it opens. Lastly, let's drag overhotkey again, and this time assign leftalt + F9 since that's the shortcut usedwithin the software.Oh, and it seems I still have a vacantspace, so let's fill that with mute.As for custom button icons, I downloadan image, usually a program logo, byclicking the cog at the top right ofthis box. You can either select openicon library to choose one of Fifine'scolorful options, uh, but for somethingmore specific like a program, clickselect local file, and then click yourdownloaded image. From there, you canshrink it down and click okay whenyou're done, and you've got a custombutton icon.[Music]Also, I just want to point out that theD6 allows you to create up to 10 pagesfor loads of custom shortcuts. Toalternate between these pages, you canclick the Fifine control deck dropownand drag over previous page or next pageto act as a page turner.Now, let's talk the monitor andlighting. Starting with the monitor,being an ultra wide isn't ideal for gamerecording, but there are a few reasonsI'm going to carry on using it. One, Idon't have room in my current layout foranother 16x9 aspect ratio monitor, letalone in landscape mode. Two, I can'tsacrifice the utility of an ultrawidejust to record gaming videos. It's fartoo valuable to have for video editing,multitasking, and gaming in a 21x9aspect ratio when I'm not recording. Asfor lighting, no, I don't have anystudio or streamer lights. They're notin my budget and I do have this GOIglide beam overhead that is very brightwhen set to bright white. I suppose myFifi microphone is worth an honorablemention. Why am I using a headsetmicrophone when I have a dedicated mic?With how my desk is currently laid out,the only place I have for the lowprofileboom arm is far off on the right side ofmy desk. When I swing the mic over,it'll be in front of the camera. I couldswitch things up, but at the moment, Ilike my desk layout the way it is,except I would still like to swap outthat PC case, which I'll touch on injust a moment. Depending on how thingsgo with my second channel, maybe I willalter the desk layout to be bettersuited for streaming or recording. Ifthat happens, maybe I'll go back to anLes. Now, earlier I mentioned that I'vebeen thinking about switching out my PCcase. Well, this is what I havecurrently. Corsair 6500X in white withbamboo. I picked this case up solely foraesthetic purposes. Prior to this, I hada Lean Lee O11 Dynamic Evo, which Iabsolutely loved, but it was black and Imissed having a white case. The bambooand lack of a corner pillar are prettymuch the two features that sold me onthis case, even though I could have justupgraded to an O1 Vision or compact. Butno, I wanted the white and bamboobecause I thought it would fit perfectlyin my setup. But here's the problem.It's too big. It's tall. It's wide andit's ridiculously deep. I mean, look howfar back my side fans are. But I have tohave them there or I can't utilize thepass through grommets. I also don'tremember seeing so much cable slack inmy old O11, but in this I see so much.And it used to be even worse before Iadded the vertical GPU mount. Andspeaking of the vertical GPU mount, I'mforced to extend it out this far becauseotherwise I can't get the display cablesthrough to the ports because it hasthese horizontal bars on the back thatget in the way of the cables. But I onlydiscovered that hindrance recently. Mynumber one reason for still consideringa new case is the sheer size. It's sotall I don't want to place it on theright side of my desk or it'll block mywindow view. It's a beautiful case, butit limits what I can do with an alreadylimited space. At the moment, I'm in themarket for a white case for around $100,but ideally no more than $120. I'm on atight budget for this one, and I washoping to replenish my wallet withprofits from selling my 6500X. I wasdrawn into the Lean Lee O1 VisionCompact, but it is on the high end of mybudget and it's not much smaller thanthe 6500X, which wouldn't really solvemy biggest issue, just slightly lessenit. Another case under consideration isthe NZXT H6 Flow. It comes in white, ismostly an open design, it's only $19.99or $89.99 if it stays discounted, andit's noticeably smaller than the 6500X.By comparing measurements, I'veconfirmed it's 17.13 in tall compared to19 1/2, 16.34 in deep compared to 18.5,and 11.3 in wide compared to 12 and 3/4.And from what I've read so far, it seemsto receive praise for offering optimalair flow. And I have an RTX 380 andRyzen 75800X, so I need a case with goodair flow. The only downside I see is Iwould need to purchase two 140 mm fansfor the floor because none come includedand 120 mm fans will not fit. So, that'swhere I'm currently at with my PC. I'msure there are other options out there,so I'll do some more research beforemaking a purchase. I want to be moremethodical this time and not just jumpon a case for aesthetics. But, if any ofyou have any suggestions based on mycriteria, please drop them down in thecomments. And if you made it this far,thank you for watching. I know thereweren't too many changes this time andabsolutely no aesthetic changes. I'mhoping to keep the current setup untilthe new year and then do a 2026 refresh,but the desire for me to rip down mysetup and build a new one can changewith the wind. It's happened severaltimes, but for now, I'm happy,comfortable, and I do feel inspired inthis space, and that's what's importantto me in a gaming setup. As for theadditions I made in this video and mysecond channel, I guess we'll see howoften I post and if that takes off atall. For now, I just want that channelto be my place to let loose, be moremyself, and have fun. No productresearch or outlining, no scripts, justme playing the games that bring me joyand sharing those experiences withwhomever wants to join. If you'reinterested in checking out my gamingchannel, it's a casual AF gamer, aptlynamed because I'm no pro at any of thegames I play. I just play to have fun.And the games I'll most likely beplaying are Modern Warfare 3 andBorderlands, maybe with a bit ofFortnite, and of course, anything elsethat comes along that I want to play andshare with you. Anyway, that's it forthe video. Thank you so much forwatching. later.","thank you, this video helps so much

Dropping the comment for the giveaway for the $2k stealthy PC!
Hi! This is a long shot I’m willing to take. My cyber power crapped out on me two weekends ago. I am a 23 yr old mom, married, living with my parents because everything is so expensive. I work a full time job from home while also caring for my daughter full time. I got into PC gaming in 2022 and ever since then, especially now, it’s my relaxation on the weekends. I get me time, where I’m not needed as mom, wife or daughter. I cannot afford to fix or buy a new one unfortunately as we have much more important things to tend to. My baby comes first of course. Thank you for reading and good luck to everyone 🫶
Good chair for my set-up, although I probably will be removing the arm rests and legs so it fits in my set-up

And as you can see here,this desk features quite a few lightshere. And they do have a purpose. So,they are able to correspond to a game uhwhich we're going to test that outafter. And uh also, we got a light inthe front here on the sides as well. Anduh as you can see here, I have all thecables on the floor. So, I'm going tohave to hide all those cables insidehere. The other thing is you can see Ihave my monitor mounted to the wallhere. And the reason why I did that ismy previous desk was a little bitwobbly. But this one like at the lowestsetting here,it's it's not really moving at all.Taking a look at the right hand sidehere, we got the up and down. Also, weare able to set two memories here aswell. And then we have a little displayhere that displays the how high thetable is right now. So, at its lowest,it's 28 in. And uh I've gone ahead andset memory 2 so it goes to the highestpoint here.Not sure why you would need it thishigh, but it does go all the way to 53in here. And for any reason you're gonnahave the desk this high and you want tosee if it's wobbly, there's a little bitof a wobble to it, but not too crazy.Like as you can see here, I'm able todefinitely move it around, but when it'sat the midpoint or the lowest point,definitely there's like no moving thisdesk. And moving up and down is a verysmooth operation. And the motor is veryquiet, which is good. So whenever you'reputting the desk up and down and it'snot going to make like any huge uh noisethere. So right now like at around 33inches here there's really no wobblejust like a bit like right now I'm likereally pushing this desk hard. It's notlike moving around which is good. And ifyou're going to leave it at the lowestpoint uh which most people I think aregoing to do anyways if you're sitting ona chair definitely very sturdy. Like ifyou're moving your mouse doesn't matterhow hard you're moving your hand aroundit's not going to really move the tablewhich is good. And the chair like fitsgood. like the armrests here gounderneath as well. Uh there's thispiece of metal that's holdingeverything, but it doesn't really get inthe way of the armrest here, which isgood. On the left hand side here, wehave a few more buttons. So, we got theQ1, Q2, and Q3 here. And then you'reable to go ahead and choose a fewdifferent colors. So, you got the allthe like solid colors. And then we alsohave the rainbow color as well. Andthen, uh we got Q2, which controls theside light here. You can go ahead andcircle the colors here or set up therainbow color. And the Q3 are these kindof like side lights here. And these aremagnetic. So you're able like to goahead and circle the colors here. So onething is we are able to go ahead and uhcontrol these lights. So we got a USBcable here which we're going to testthat out after. Taking a look at themeasurements here. And the length hereis 150 cm. Checking out the depth hereis around 69 12 cm. So right now I'mgoing to go ahead and organize all thecables. Also the PC that you see therethat's uh around 30 kg more than 60 lbthere. So that thing is definitely veryheavy and which is going to go on theside there. And I'm going to go aheadand put all the cables inside here.We're going to see how well it hideseverything. The other thing which I wantto go ahead and cover before I puteverything together here is this leatherdesk mat. And it does cover the wholedesk here except the portion where youlift this up for the cables. And uhunderneath it is kind of like a magnetbecause the whole base here of the deskis metal. And here we got this uh niceuh leather with a nice stitching on theends here. You can easily like just uhtake it off if you want to cleananything and then uh just put it backon. And on the right hand side here, wegot the black light logo with thestitching. So, I got the desk all sethere. Everything on top like I usuallyhave. So, the PC, the speaker, thekeyboard, everything is in here. And uhoverall, there's a nice clean look herenow. And uh the RGB here. I thought Iwouldn't really like it so much to haveall this uh RGB around, but actually itlooks good. As you can see here, it hasthis nice clean look. And if I want togo ahead and just like switch out thecolors to this one here, I can go aheadand do that. Uh there's no adjustingbrightness from this controller here.But if we go ahead and install the app,which I'm going to show you in a second,we are able to go ahead and uh modifythese lights quite a bit. Also, in game,we are able like to set this up, whichI'm going to show you shortly. So,probably you can already notice herewith the amount of cables that we hadbefore. Right now, everything is hidingin the desk here. Here's the results.Pretty much I only have the power cablethere and just two cables going to thesubwoofer there. Pretty much that's it.Everything else is kind of on the deskright now. Since I have this hugesoundbar here, I decided to put it atthe end here, which fits perfectly anddoesn't move, which is nice. And uh herewe have all the where the cables arepretty much. I have a power bar herewhich is powering everything frommonitor to PC. Here you can see all thecables. Uh so I do have a power bar. Soeverything is plugged in through thereand then I just have uh one going to theoutlet and all the USB cables andeverything is in here. And uh here's acloser look at underneath here. So allthe cables are pretty much hidden here.So nothing is in the way. So just thatone power cable there and that's it. Sochecking out the legs here. They aremetal. So I have a magnet here and uheverything seems very solid all around.And uh just checking the width and depthhere. So around 6 1/2 cm with uh 9 1/2cm. So the max load you can have on thistable is 125 kg or 275 lb. And uhalready this uh PC alone is over 60 lb.And then we got the speaker here. Uh theonly thing that's not attached rightnow, I still have the monitor attachedto the wall. That's how I had itpreviously. So the good thing is thetable still stays in place here. Itdoesn't really move around. Even thoughI have like heavy on the right hand sidehere, it still stays pretty strong. Iknow I have it at the lowest point, butif I were to raise it higher, obviouslythere's going to be more wobble. But atits lowest point here, it doesn'twobble, which is nice. Checking out thecontrollers here. We are able to goahead and set a preset. So, we have oneor two. And uh this is the displayyou're getting when you're moving thetable lower or higher. So, if I was togo ahead and go to the lowest preset, Ihave that on memory. And for any reasonyou don't want uh only you to touch thetable or if you have any kids, you don'twant them to like kind of put the tableat the highest point, you can go aheadand lock the whole controller here. So,if you want to go ahead and hold the Sfor 13 seconds, around 13 seconds, andthen uh we'll see a lock here. And tounlock, just go ahead and hold the S for8 seconds, and then it will unlockeverything. And on the left hand side,this is where we have the controllersfor the lighting for the side and thefront here. So, we have three of them.Uh this one is a separate light, too.So, for the first one here, if you wantto go ahead and hold it, it will turn itoff. And then we got the second onewhich is on the side here. Turns it off.And then the third one which is this onehere. And to go ahead and turn it on,just press it once and that's it. Andyou're able to cycle through all thedifferent colors here as well. So I dohave the table all plugged in via USBcable. And uh you will need to go aheadand download the app which is for somereason 5.6 GB. I am not sure why itneeds to be so big. Um it does installthese Nvidia drivers, a few things likethat. So going to the desk option firsthere. Uh we can see here the light isonline but lift is offline. I tried toinstall the driver once again but thisdid not work. Hopefully in a futurefirmware update they'll uh be able tofix this because this is good because uhnot many other desks really have thisoption. The cool thing about this isyou're able to use this with a timer. Soyou're able to set this to whatever timeto go at this height and then to godown. So going to the lighting here, weare able to control the brightness hereas well. And uh the brightness can go aslow as uh like 1% here. So it's a verysubtle. So if you would if you're likeplaying a game, you don't want thelights to kind of hit your eyes oranything like that. So you can set it aslow as 1% if you wanted to. But I foundit like around like 10 or 20%, it'sokay. it doesn't really bother you evenif you go ahead and play any game. Soright here we are able to go ahead andswitch off uh any of the LEDs. So thefront one if I wanted to the side onesas well. So you're able to controleverything from here. And then we gotsome scenes here as well. So if I gocompetitive so it kind of cycles thecolors all around which is pretty cool.And then leisure here. That's anotherscene. Office.And then there's this good morning. Theone thing you can notice uh what theydid with the RGB strips here only likeone RGB lights up at a time which isgreat. That's kind of more of a premiumRGB lighting. Probably you've seen thoseuh other RGB strips like three at a timelight on which doesn't look smooth buthere you can see like how smootheverything just flows. It looks prettygood. Next jumping to the home sectionhere. Uh the other cool thing is uh soif I go ahead and click screen here andstart that. So, anything I show on myscreen is going to kind of you'll seethe colors matching. So, if I go aheadand just play this video here,as you can see, it kind of like matcheswhatever is playing there. And then, uh,we're also able to go ahead and do formusic as well. So, I just have somemusic playing and it's going by thesound.So, now let's go ahead and uh start thegaming one here. And I do have Valerantinstalled already. Uh there's a fewgames that are supported right now. Soyou can see Counterstrike 2, League ofLegends, and a few other games here. Andwe can see here the Valerant is runninghere. So it should open up prettyshortly. And as you can see, the lightsare already taking an effect to Sowhatever we're seeing on the screenhere.Welcome to basic training. Jet, come on.Put on. No. So, looking at Valeranthere, I think it makes it more immersiveif you're playing this game. Especially,I think if you're going to be playing asingle player game and having thelighting go around, it's going to bemore immersive uh rather than amultiplayer game because you don't wantkind of like lights going in your eyesand all that. But, uh you have thatoption if you want to go ahead and turnoff one of the lights in the front orjust leave the side ones. So, one thingto keep in mind is if you're going to beusing one of these scenes, uh, as soonas you close the app, if you go aheadand exit the app, it's going to go aheadand, uh, revert to the default just likeas you would, uh, turn the colors onfrom here from the switches. So, rightnow, looking at the resources this appis using is 0.4%CPU and uh, one gig of memory. Hopefullyin the future they'll go ahead and uhmodify this app a little bit to make ita little bit less uh demanding on thememory, but uh right now it's 0.5 to and1 gig of memory, which is a bit high. Sothere's a few things this table hasgoing for it. So we got the magnetic tophere, which makes the whole desk kind offeel uh premium. Um and then thelighting here looks good. It's not likejust a gimmick or anything like that.And uh I wish it had a LED like at theback as well. It would have beenactually good. I would have actuallypreferred more to have like the LEDstrip at the back rather than the fronthere. That's just me, but I think itwould have made more sense that way. So,this table has MDF and it's wrapped withmetal here. Very sturdy all around. Itdoes have this whole piece of metal inthe front here. So, nothing is reallyever going to bend or feel like it'sbending or anything like that, which isnice. So everything is going to remainnice and flat. The thing which I wouldhave loved to see this desk have is kindof adjust the scenes like maybe from asmartphone app uh rather than installingsomething on your PC because usually Idon't really like installing things onmy PC any especially this 5.6 gig ofthings in there and then leaving it openon the background while playing a gameand it's taking up memory and all that.So, but if you want to get more immersedand have all the colors kind of likewhat while you're playing a game. So, ifif you prefer something like that, thishas that option. But personally, I wouldhave loved just to have an app on myphone and just to control just to havemore scenes and brightness and all thatbecause you're not really able tocontrol the brightness straight from thecontrollers here. And looking at theassembly, you're getting one huge box,uh, just the table itself, and then asmaller box with the legs, but you willneed to have two people in order to setthis up. If you're by yourself and tryto set this table up, you're definitelygoing to struggle a lot. So, just keepthat in mind. The good thing about theassembly portion is the legs. You canjust go ahead and uh, put them on. Noscrews or anything like that, which isnice. The only screws that you reallyneed is just to put the base on thelegs. Pretty much that's it. And you'redone. No more screws anywhere else,which is nice. So, assembly was great,but you will need two people when youwhen it comes time to lifting andflipping the table around. Really hopeyou enjoyed watching this video. If youhave any questions about this tablehere, go ahead and leave a commentbelow. I'll be more than happy to answerit. And I'll see you on the next one.","I thought I would share this with you, as I experienced the same thing regarding the lift control through the software. I reached out to Blacklyte, and an expansion dock is a necessary new part introduced after a recent software update. The expansion dock as they explained it "" is a small plug-in part that connects to the control box and allows the software to communicate properly with the motor system"". After they were able to confirm that, they let me know that they will ship two expansion docks to me, since my second (work) desk will be delivered tomorrow. For me, it will take anywhere from 5 to 10 days to get the docks, but well worth it, since this is a feature not many other desks have.
Would this desk accommodate an under desk pc mount? And does it look like it would handle a dual screen monitor arm or if need be 2 separate arms? Im assuming the arm would mount between the main desk surface and the compartment door at the rear similar to the way the magnus desk is set up?

It's too big for the PC case,so we're going to water block it. We'regoing to be using a white Fantex waterblock to go ahead and take care of thisguy. If you've never taken apart a GPU,it only seems scary, but once you do ita few times, you get quite comfortable.Only a few screws with this MSI 4090,and we're right down to the PCB. Takingapart GPUs is definitely scary,especially if it's your only one. I knowhow it feels because you don't want tobreak your card, but it's a lot easierthan you think, and as long as you'recareful, you shouldn't have any issues.If you're doing any maintenance or waterblocking a GPU, you got to make sure toremove the original thermal base. Thisone's a lot more stout or thick than theother ones, and you can see it here.It's pretty dang hard to get rid of. Thegreat thing about not cheaping out on awater block is one, they're usually moreefficient, and they cover more of theGPU, but also all of the pads arepre-cut. So, this Fantex kit came inhandy. Everything was super easy, and itdidn't take very long. Now, it's time toadd the thermal paste to the GPU. And ifI'm ever doing any custom water cooling,I'm going to be doing this manually tomake sure every bit of that thing iscovered. If I'm not doing liquid metal,I'm definitely using a spatula to spreadthis thing out. Now that everything'sdone, we can sandwich the block with theactual PCB. I just line up the holesfrom behind and look underneath it justso I can make sure I'm not movinganything because you don't want the padsto move during this process becauseyou're going to have worse temps if theydon't move on top of the chips thatthey're supposed to be on. Now, wheneverdoing your loop, just make sure that youdon't power anything else on. You justwant power going to the pump because ifthere is a leak for whatever reason andyou did something wrong, you don't fryany of the components. But look howbeautiful this coolant looks. I knowthere's going to be extra maintenance,but I know that going in. But look atthese chilly temps we are","The cost it would have been of getting a bigger case than water blocking it
Yo that’s sick!! I’ve always wanted to take apart a gpu but I’m too scared of breaking my 7800xt
I sharted when i heard the gpu crack
im well aware that termal paste can be basically be just jizzed on rather careless and it will (given there is a sufficient amount of course) spread just fine as soon you mount it later (even tested it multiple time myself in various and the most daring ways) but it simply dosent feel right when there is still some shiny/metal part of the chip visible before you sent it so i 100% felt that goop spread there <3
Bro got me all motivated to go water blocks
do not remove ptm 7950 ,thats not thermal paste ,thats thermal phase changin material ,it will settle itself in the new block and is 3 times better than anything but liquid metal
I've taken apart probably over 100 at this point and the fan connectors still scare me. That coolant is awesome!
0:30 thats insane how close you came to taking out that entire row of transistors and ruining the card lol.
Yeah rather choose that aircooler, at least its using that X-Bracket. Its there for a good reason.
To be honest this should be standard these days, considering the sick prices.
Great! Now it'll fit my dell sff
Absolutely beautiful
If videocards get any bigger they are going to be their own motherboard soon.
They make little air pumps specifically for pressure testing custom loops
you drop a single screw onto carpet
Use 99% isopropyl alcohol over 91%

A lot less water content for fast drying when working with electronics
Taking apart a Gpu seems a lot like taking apart a laptop
Pretty sure you want to reuse that bracket on the back of the gpu that spreads the load evenly over the chip.
I mean it's kinda bizarre how every other component that makes a PC either stayed around the same size or actually got significantly smaller over the years but the GPUs just literally turned into Hulks sizewise and they keep growing every year.

Like if this trend continues in about 10y PCs gonna be essentially 90% just graphic cards and you gonna need dedicated GPU power supplies.
being careful unfortunately isn't enough, my 5700xt apparently was on the verge of failure, and a reassembly sent it over the edge
Wow, that looks nice. I need to do this. Do you have any longer instructional videos?
That's the temp I get on my 4060 when idling (it has one fan)
i have a fraqtal pop xl. case says it has room in the front for a 420mm rad, it does not. so i took some tools to it and now it does. 

looks kinda like an early 2000's ricer, but im at a flat 40c in an 80 degree garage in florida.

get an angle grinder and a sawzall. then you never have to worry of your case has space.
impractical but i understand . i like mini itx format but powerful big gpus make mini itx unpractical . if you compromise the size you have to go for medium tier in gpus so i would prefer visuals on the screen instead of the case . all this appart of using less active cooling and less noise . so in the long term your hardware gonna last longer . mechanic fail of the soldering is a real thing when you operate with constant temperature changes . contraction and retraction make cracks and false contactacts everywhere . this is part of why power phases are pushed down with the heatsinks
Removing the thermal paste Removing a capacitor
Thats so cool.
Poor gamer here, my 3060ti when its fully loaded setting hotspot at around 100'C and ""gpu temp"" is 82'C. I know it need maintance but ive never did it on any gpu, and where i live it costs 100$. now im stuck on indie games, saving money to take care of it.
GPU thermal Paste are really hectic to clean off, especially on Nvidia
What is that thing displaying the temperature? So cool
I am pretty happy with the 32c I get off this one... Stalk and its not a new card its over 12 years old R9's last a long time
Once upon a time I watercooled crossfire HD 6990, then got the very bright idea to mount the cooling cables to my home radiator... Cheap heating. Ended up gonking the waterblock and a complete system failure due to too much water pressure that shorted everything out. Luckily I was able to save all of 800TB of the data.
Wow quite a beauty wafer right there!
“chilly temps” referring to the gpu, shows cpu temps
Extra maintenance? I thought less maintenance
I damn want water cooling so bad but the risk of getting it wrong at some point scares me out of it
Is their a noticeable difference in performance compared to stock fans honestly?
i need this 4 my 9070 XT when the fans go 100% you thing a ariplain is starting xD
I found out that most Cards run okay at 65ºc and having OC with w/cooled at 54ºc will not give you better performance for that Struggle of maintenance and expensive gears to make it work..
The GPU doesnt fit the case so we are gonna spend three times as much to water block it instead of buying a new case.
Risk $2000 graphics card or buy $100 case HMMMMMMMM I WONDER WHAT IS A BETTER OPTION
What is the maintenance you have to do, and how frequent?
Even with the water block it’s still 84.2 degrees that’s crazy
When i finally get my 6500xt upgraded im going to take that piece of junk apart just to get the practice and it will be the best thing it's ever contributed to my PC experience. Dont buy graphics cards before researching.
Nice I took my GTX 750 TI out of my vintage gaming computer because it was getting insanely hot and still had its warranty stickers intact right on the screws put the new paste on went to screw it all back together and one of the screws has completely cross threaded and just spins perfect
When you butter the toast make sure to put a Hershey kiss in the middle to eliminate air bubbles
I'm a mechanic my whole life is taking apart expensive things and remembering how to put it back together
Yea guys use caution but don't be scared
Do you even understand that your GPU is running less efficient at that temperature? It's like cooling your car motor down to cold start...
Those things are built to run on a set temperature. Most gpus run best on 60-80°C

For water-cooling to be better than fans, you need to regulate/heat the water to 60-70°C depending on the power of your GPU and thermoresistance between your components.

But since it's only for show like apple vision pro it's ok, but don't pretend to know what you're doing or that it's necessary.
And still a 3 slot gpu. Why it don't come with a single slot gpu bracket
That cpu temp is on idle? Or gaming temp?
does all 4090 are compatible with that water block?
It’s not that it’s ticker or anything. It’s drying out
we water blocked the gpu, look at the temp of the cpu... buhee
Is there glitter in the water
AIO is the way to go, not chunky fans
I wish i had the damm money for a pc a good one damm
ok sometimes watercooling looks good but no way i do water cooling for my self too much risk and too expenssive for no reason no use for gaming .. .
Thats the CPU temp
Buy, bigger case




Nah just water block it
Why brands don't make AIO for GPU??
Can anyone share the actual name of the thermal pad kit he's using? I can't seem to find it.
Why not use ptm7950? It has better performance than paste and is basically immortal to pump out???
would you say its worth it repasting my 3060ti or getting a 5060 ti 16gb (im playing in 1440p where my 3060ti struggles)
First you said taking apart a GPU only seems scary until you get used to it. You then immediately said taking apart a GPU is definitely scary. I'm sore confiors
Is that temp display on mobo?
you removed the best thermal salution that gpu could have PTM7950
Those pads are backwards right? The textured side should face the GPU I thought.
use a leak tester! why doesnt anyone use a leak tester or recommended using a leak tester?
What about kryo sheets mine are by thermal Grizzly
cpu temp?
29° on the 4090 is BS!

Im kinda new in pc building but isnt phanteks like considered silent?
Your temps are the same as my 3090 TI with a lot more Wattage and no water cooling lol. All you have to do is undervolt it to .875 max, no reason to use water cooling anymore it's literally dead. My 3090 ti pulls about 300 watts instead of 450-500 while gaming, i have about 5-10fps difference on competitive unlocked fps games which i do not play anyway, and i always lock my frames to 120 because my monitor is 120hz. Idle temps on the gpu are around 25-28c browsing etc. Gaming is about 45-50c. ALL this on a nzxt h6 flow case 9 fans total + 3 from gpu. Top fans are the radiator from cpu.

But i cant deny water cooling looks nice, though overpriced and messy to deal with.
W
I wish you sent me a GPU
Water blocking is scary and disgusting
I've been water blocking my GPU starting with my 1080ti . Custom loop is the only way. Those AI coolers for lazy people.
Can you give me one 4060 for free ...
I live in India
Can I get a pc?
No ptm 7950? Cmon man
chicken
Im getter the same or better temps using fans. This is purely for looks.
Spend 70$ pn bigger case? I sleep
Spend 200$ on a waterblock and run the risk of flooding your pc? Real sheet
Regular thermal paste with water block man wtf, where’s your phase thermal paste
yeah dont scratch at the processor lol... Its fine its thermal paste. You dont need to get it off every nook and cranny.
Created a unsellable card nobody will pay even half of what you put into it once you decide to upgrade
""Look how beautiful that coolant looks"" *proceeds to show angle of PC where you can barely tell what coolant looks like*..... Yeaaa very nice so beautiful
Never open your gpu.
really don't need to spread the paste. 5 dots is all you need
lol. Thermal paste on gpu???????? I hope at least it is Phase-change thermalpaste
Damn stop buy custom designs when you literally throw away the cooler. Just buy a founders edition damn
Wrong you don't want bubbles.
Are you intentionally not installing the spring back?
That spread was HORRIBLE
dude its called Msi rtx 4090 trio respect the card and ofc its a big card TRIO tripple lame ass
DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GUY
You made it ugly you murder the badboi
too much paste, dude. Way too much
can you please donate me a GPU

Law ofequivalent exchange, Mrs. Irving. That'show we do it here,bro. You're","I can imagine the guy scratching his head saying ""what the hell Dino""
""Law of equivalent exchange.""... 
Me over here looking for the Philosopher's Stone.
""bro you're ducked""
Lmao, im not gonna lie, my wife personally has 2 Michael Kors bags that I specifically bought because of Dino, and my friend is now on the same wave. You're the man Dino changing the game!
I took Dino's teachings into practice and it really works, I went shopping with my wife and gave her €200,- to buy a nice outfit and then took her out for diner and paid for everything including our nanny who watched our kid at home, then the next day I casually mentioned I bought the PSVR2 and now after 2 weeks, still no complains or reactions about my purchase She's just exited for me.
Watched and learned too many Full Metal Alchemist episodes
I watched enough FMA to know how screwed you are when the exchange is not equal. Bro is losing an arm
“Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.”
That’s how he knew, he fcked up
That Labubu for food was straight up more diabolical than everything else because that's how bro's gonna get fed moving forward
He's the guy who puts everyone into trouble
""Law of equivalent exchange"" my left foot this transmutaion has backfired on Mr. Irving
Bro boutta wip out a philosopher stone to ignore the law
""law of equivalent exchange""...bro's gonna lose an arm and a leg
That cool but can u teach us single
Gamers how to get a maiden so we can flex as you do ps ur my hero bro
Bubu salary: 50k
Dudu salary: 70k

Household income: 70k
Bubu household budget: 70k

Law of equivalent exchange

Dudu ask to buy item-A
Taken from 70k but also has to give Bubu something worth of item-A also taken from what was taken from that 70k
Bro be talking Fullmetal
Bro raised the bar for her to the point where it's unreachable for him. Goated
Movies directors need to ask for your advice. You are too good.
""I teach married men ."" Aight imma head out
""Law of Equivalent Exchange"" We will not forget that boss
""Law of equivalent exchange"" like in Fullmetal alchemist
Bro saying the real thing in the end
Not sure what part of this is equal but yeah, your not wrong. Also, a room tour would be nice since you have added a lot to your setup since the last one.
The best law ever man
Versace for ER Nightreign? Bro is cooked
Dude, you can directly buy it from Chinese factories, same factory supplies to the boutiques where u bought them...
Lmao. Dino gonna make husbands go broke
Dino, the Wife Whisper
Bro you're cooked was pure gold
Bro you're f*** got me
I can hear mr. Erving cursing
Dino really summoned a meteor on the poor guys home lol
Such a good vibe...
Law of equivalent exchange my bro started teaching chemistry
""I thought... I thought we were friends ""
“Law of equivalent exchange” aka Law of negotiating desire.
From the get i had a feeling he was gonna take that route
Now he Gave human blood taste to the tiger.
Bro is cooking. 
Love from India 🇮🇳
My husband follows you. Whenever he got some techy thing that I let him sleep for weeks before he purchase, he would get me smtg twice the cost.

Thank you for educating our husbands.
He's trying to sabotage marriages
LOL! Law of Equivalent Exchange = Unfair.

I love the part of in exchange of nuggets for a bag
Ohh shit... Erving dude say goodbye to your money now.
Dino did you bad here my friend.
Labubus for Chicken Nugget Meal I can’t
I love your reference to FMA
40$ nightreign vs 10k$ channel law of equivalent exchange
Show us your car collection. Real cars not toys. We got him guys
The ending!
Dino put crazy pressure on that guy
Thank you bro. You are a good man indeed
I love your vibes, I just followed you. Im not certain, but you give of filipinovibes. I work w a filipino dude, and you remind me of him. BTW, as a woman, that purse is a flex!
As a husband, i could say dino words are absolutely accurate
You never know. You might be helping the husband too...
Yep! For every game or electronics.. I buy myself something or a weekend trip on him.
Poor Mr. Erving
Married men: Now we are cooked.
He's really funny
Ah no f no , no no 
Wife must not watch this ....
Wtf, now the missus' bags are your trophies too?!
Bro didn’t name the law for McDonald’s. That wasn’t equivalent af
mrs erving got new lesson about equality
Too late, that fan has his wife's family name as his last name.
I made sure my wife's YouTube algorithm never finds this man.
There's balance in the universe whenever Dino steps up
Jokes aside... It's always been like this, people just don't dare to put it this way because it doesn't sound endearing. But we all know phases in relationship isn't always lovey-dovey. You learn to be affertionate and heartful with any actions, no matter how unlikely it is to be felt as romantic gesture in generic context.
Best save ever
Love FMA
Oh no. Now Mr. Irving""s wants becomes expensive
The math is mathing!
Dino highering standards for wives everywhere I love it
You don't need equivalent exchange if you are forever alone
Just remember this , when they ask for something is cost 10x what yours will cost .
you were the chosen one!!!!! it was said that you would destroy the wives, not join them!!! you were to bring balance to the dudes, not leave us in the darkness….
Made in China bags, zipper sewn on in Italy, or wherever, and they say ""Made in Italy"". They also make huge profits this way. I couldn't believe it when I heard about it, but they do the same thing with meat. ""Product of USA"" labeled on your steak, but it is actually from some other country.
This man the biggest opp
The homie Dino man
Of course this is about Philosopher's Stone, it will explain his sum of cash, formed from rearranging steel rust atoms into gold.
How it’s done or two of everything, one for you one for her!
Law of Equivalent Exchange - 
Elden Ring Cost - $40 = Louis Vuitton Cost - $1,200
so you need $1,240 to buy an Elden Ring Nightreign
Mr, Erwin Good Luck.. LoL
Dino's law
There is nothing equivalent about those exchanges
Bro was humble. Bro is now just evil
full metal alchemists law of equivalent exchange
I love you videos you just make my day feel good and you are the best person to ever exist just saying it not to be get something from you but it's really cool I just like your videos
Ahh nostalgia feel as he said ""law of equivalent extange"" full metal Alchemist
The ""F""! How is that equal???
This is true. Because of Dino I was able to buy new monitor bought my wife a new bag and a dress
you got a hot fudge sundae??? I need to rethink my priority bro...
Brother thinks we have enough money to buy two expensive items instead of just one
Dino, my wife approved your messages!
Now I'm having Switch 2!! Part 2 is needed
I'll never let my wife see this.
You make Mr Ervings insecure
lol I’m glad my wife ain’t into purses. She ain’t even into jewelry, she only wears the ones I’ve bought her. I got a keeper
Versace bag isn’t the cost of nightreign
Mr. Erving.... run...
GOOD LUCK BRAAH ERVING :))
Your wife would never know about a digital purchase
bro i bought myself a motorcycle and bought my wife small car. She isnt complaining at all
Challenge: I wanna see Dino skateboarding... If he can

It looks like he declined the challenge🫡
single AF. can't relate.

carter watchu doing on your computer that you need to use a pedal to close a tab that fast

Needing one for doordash is just crazy
If you don’t Acknowledge us Carter by August 1st we will riot
Why do you need to close google chrome so fast when you have a gf
No I don’t need a foot pedal for my setup actually
NOTICE US. NOTICE YOUR YOUTUBE AUDIENCE. WE EXIST. OR ELSE, YOU WILL BE FORCED TO DO THE THUG SHAKE.
Opera GX can also change your tabs. When you press F12, it will close all the tabs, and switch to a cover tab (some are default, like wiki) and you can also add some of your own. If you press F12 again, u will return to the previously open tabs
Bro the foot pedal for DoorDash is the gluttony the Bible talked about
lol, bro forgot about ALT+F4 and Ctrl C+Ctrl V
Introducing... The foot pedal! The most inconvenient thing you could buy
lowk a foot pedal would go hard, can you get racing pedals to also do this? a clutch pedal to open a game? would be awesome
Nah, I tap my foot a lot while sitting there, I would definitely accidentally hit it
These are made for the osrs gamers so they we can relax our wrists sometimes while xp grinding.
Ok, but why does Carter need to close tabs??? whatcha got in there Carter??
The sky zone socks are wild lol
Why did I just see warzone players who all had foot deals so I commented asking what they were for since my controller has enough buttons on the short right before this. I knew it used everything for my feed but that quick? I mean I clicked post then scrolled. How?
I’m on trackpad and I have set it to make a three finger tap (custom gesture) do the alt + tab. It is instant

Carter? Anyways heres how scruedrivers are made

Screwdrivers are manufactured through a combination of metalworking, forging, machining, and assembly processes. Here’s a breakdown of the typical steps involved in producing a standard screwdriver:

⸻

1. Raw Materials
• Blade/Shaft: Usually made from high-carbon steel, chrome-vanadium steel, or tool steel for strength and durability.
• Handle: Made from plastic (polypropylene or acetate), rubber, or sometimes wood.

⸻

2. Forging the Shaft/Blade
• A steel rod is cut to length.
• It’s heated in a furnace and hot-forged (pressed into shape) to form the screwdriver shaft and tip.
• The shape of the tip (flathead, Phillips, etc.) is partially formed at this stage.

⸻

️ 3. Machining and Shaping
• CNC machines (or similar tools) further refine the blade, especially the tip:
• Phillips heads are milled to form the cross pattern.
• Flathead tips are ground to a sharp edge.
• The shaft may be knurled (textured) or grooved for grip or fitting.

⸻

4. Heat Treatment
• The metal is hardened and tempered through heat treatment to improve strength and wear resistance.
• This involves heating to a high temperature, then cooling rapidly (quenching), followed by reheating to reduce brittleness.

⸻

5. Magnetizing (Optional)
• Some screwdriver tips are magnetized using an electromagnetic coil to help hold screws in place during use.

⸻

️ 6. Coating and Finishing
• Shafts are coated for corrosion resistance using:
• Black oxide
• Chrome plating
• Nickel plating
• Tips may be hardened further or coated with anti-slip material for grip.

⸻

7. Molding the Handle
• Plastic is injection molded around the end of the shaft.
• For ergonomic designs, dual materials (hard plastic + soft rubber) are used.
• In acetate screwdrivers, the plastic is often chemically bonded to the metal shaft.
• Wooden handles are typically pressed on and pinned or glued.

⸻

8. Assembly and Quality Control
• Handle and shaft are assembled (if not molded as one piece).
• Each screwdriver is inspected for:
• Proper fit and shape of the tip
• Hardness and straightness of the shaft
• Handle attachment and comfort

⸻

9. Packaging and Shipping
• The screwdrivers are labeled, packaged (individually or in sets), and shipped to distributors or retailers.

Bru what if sm is trying to get into ur computer and they just hit the button for the password?
Just alt+tab and you‘re good to go.
alt + f4
or
alt + tab and use the middle click to close a window
Bro is the ultimate glutton having a whole ass pedal just for doordash
Day 19 of asking carter to apologize to the GTA community for mistaking GTA 4 with GTA 5
The point of a password is to avoid people logging into your account. Tf that foot pedal supposed to do??
Why tf is one of the monitors overlapping the other
Alt+F4, Ctrl + W, F12 on Opera GX, Ctrl + N, Ctrl + Shift+ N, the list goes on
When you accidentally kick the foot pedal away from its original position and then forget it was moved at night:

Footsteps approaching door foot moves towards where the pedal was supposed to be originally foot stomping on rug frantically while moaning continues coming through the screen where's that pedal? WHERE'S THE PEDAL door opening along with sound of belt buckle tinking AHHH
This helps..
ACKNOWLEDGE US NOW CARTER
For people who are experienced with alt tab and hand position auto fits it when not typing, it’s lightning fast
if you got a certain tab open and you gotta close it but whoever comes in is gonna ask what you closed do ctrl + w, ctrl + t and then ctrl + w again and when they ask hit ctrl + shift + t. close tab, open new one, close again, open last tab.
Just realized i wasnt subscribed and i have been watching you for a long long time
Get an elgato Stream Deck
Get foot pedal
Bro! I BEG YOU! Wear your shirt
Ctrl + W Dawg

Ima fan carter I folow u on all platforms and if I had to choose on tiktoker for life it would be u btw Parker burton secretly uses an Apple Magic Mouse don’t ask how I found out but u should definitely make vid asking Parker what mouse he uses and u should make more vids with white carter pcs
Skyzone socks are getting out of hand man.
never heard of Windows+D?
Why is bro wearing skyzone socks
opera gx got my back f12
Having a button for your password is peak social engineering bait
I like how a foot pedal is just two pieces of metal making contact and Carter is like there were so many off brand foot pedals back in the day
I use Arch Linux with Hyprland, I can just super key + shift + q
Why you gotta close google so fast Carter?
”Please like comment and subscribe my power bill is going through the roof and I can’t stop buying random gadgets that I don’t know what I’m going to use it for” now I see why you did that to automatically put in your password…
Keyboard macros also exist
Nice
Right - Throttle
Mid - Brake
Left - Clutch
Petition to get carters attention on us yt shorts viewers
That pedal sounds like it is useful for racing games
lets all spam carter saying : react to your yt comments
#carterreadytcomments
Maybe that foot pedal will let you crank 90s faster
You need a PC for my studies: cyber security and the gaming aspect is an very nice extra. Looking to play like cyber punk and those kind of AAA games so I will actually use the PC at his fullest. Not like people who just wanna play fortbite at 1000 fps

Yes I just copied this from the other vid comment am lazy:]
If you think your lazy, then just think about this guy.
Foot Pedals should be used for racing games like Nr2003
What is bro trying to close so fast that he needs a FRIGGIN PEDAL FOR?!?!
Im get one i aint never getting caught
You should set one for “delete search history”
thats the thing LTG uses to hide his screen when he's ragequitting from games lmao
Big back is so big you need a damn foot pedal for door dash
Alt-Tab-Ctrl-Delete is definitely too slow when mom walks in
Carter hasn't been hit with that ol alt-f4
nah you need to make a python program that maps an app locker to a hotkey
ctrl+w closes your current tab in browsers and also all of windows btw
When you can’t afford pedals on your sim racing setup:
LINE UP YOUR MONITERSS
Swipe down with three fingers to minimize a window.
I just have task manager pinned on my taskbar, and I didn't even have to spend a dollar
the doordash is biblical levels of gluttony
That was a genuine cry for help in those notes damn
A couple of the Minecraft YouTubers I watch use footpedaks for Minecraft cause one of them actually drums so thought it was smart
PUT THE OUTRO BACK
who really needs a foot pedal
""Alt + F4"": Hold my beer
IF HE DOESNT NOTICE YOUTUBE WE STRIKE 🫡🫡🫡
If you need to close or hide the window just use Windows key + D, OR Ctrl + Shift + W
You can use win + d to minimize everything and show the desktop
Build a sim setup and use it as pedals
ctrl +w
The goon pedal bro
90$ for a cheap feeling peice of plastic with a 5$ controller board attached to it is insane

About 4–5 months later, my brother Ezra launched UnlimitedStories after seeing how much fun I was having (and maybe trying to one-up me). Now we write everything together, help edit each other’s videos, and share the same storytelling brain even if we keep our channels separate.\n\nWe've been big on writing (also big anime fan) since we were both in high school and as cliche as it sounds, it didn't stop there. Our stories are originally made and only sometimes a small idea taken from other internet stories.\n\nThe background is completely mine, I worked with someone to increase the quality of the background and get the best for my viewers :D\n\nGame: Trackmania\n","My friend used my gaming setup to scamkids while I was at work. Last summer,my roommate Josh asked if he could usemy gaming PC while I was at work. Hislaptop was trash and he wanted to streamFortnite. I figured, why not? We've beenfriends since freshman year and my setupwas just sitting there unused during my9 to5. For about a month, everythingseemed fine. He'd stream a few hourseach afternoon, maybe get 20 to 30viewers. Nothing crazy. He even offeredto pay part of the internet bill sincehe was using more bandwidth. Then Istarted getting weird Discord messages.Random kids asking when I'd be streamingagain or thanking me for the coachingsession. I don't stream, never have. Iasked Josh about it. Oh yeah, sometimesviewers think I'm used since I'm usingyour setup. I correct them. Cool,whatever, not a big deal. But themessages kept coming. One kid sent me$15 on PayPal with a note for thebuilding techniques lesson. Anotherasked if I could review his gameplayfootage like I promised. I confrontedJosh again. This time he came clean,sort of. He'd been offering paidcoaching sessions, telling kids he was asemi-pro player. Since he was streamingfrom my setup in my room with myperipherals visible, people assumed hewas me. He never corrected them. It'snot a big deal, he said. I actually ampretty good at the game. These kids arelearning something. I watched one of hisVODs. He was absolute trash. Likestruggling in public lobbies bad, butthese 12-year-olds didn't know anybetter. They were paying $10 to $20 forpro coaching from someone who couldn'teven build properly. The worst part, hewas using my Epic account during thesesessions. My account with all my skinsand stats. Kids would see my season 3skins and assume he was an OG player whoknew everything. I changed all mypasswords and told him he couldn't usemy setup anymore. He threw a fit sayingI was ruining his side hustle and beingselfish with my PC. Bro, you'reliterally scamming children, I said.It's not scamming if they're happy withthe service, he argued. We're notfriends anymore. I still get occasionalmessages from kids asking aboutcoaching. I tell them the truth. Thatwasn't me. And they should be carefulabout paying strangers online for gaminglessons. Josh moved out a month later.Found out from mutual friends he's stilldoing the coaching thing, but now he hasto use his garbage laptop. Apparently,his stream quality is so bad that he'slost most of his clients. It's good.","God forbid a man gets that bag somehow
As a pro player who is 13 pro since 12 that was easy scamming for complete noobs
I can finally say I have found one that does not have 10 other versions to it
I would still keep Him as my friend. He would just have to get his own laptop.
Man I forgot how stupid all this stuff sounded-
why are you ruining my side hustle, its not like its Fraud. But it is NIMROD.
just make is own profile on your computer and change/set your password so there is no confusion

We got it for cheapbecause it had a broken fan. So, we'regoing to go ahead and custom water blockit. We've already taken off the heatsink and other parts, but now we have toclean it before we water block it. So,we're going to use some 91% isopropylalcohol, clean off the internals, andthen we can go ahead and throw on thewater block. I still remember the firstGPU that I took apart. It was myfriend's card and it was his only one. Iwas so nervous that I was going to breakit because I really couldn't afford itat the time to replace it. If you have aGPU that's running hot, thermal pads andthermal paste will be a lifesaver forit. It's not as hard as it seems and aslong as you're careful, you shouldn'thave any issues. You really don't needto get this crazy when it comes tocleaning the die. As long as the die isclean, you should be just fine. And I'monly doing it because I'm basically apain in the ass. Now that we have theGPU all cleaned up and fresh, we caninstall the 3090 Ti water block. So,depending on how much you spent on thewater block, you can get pre-cut pads oryou're going to have to cut themyourself. You just match them up towhere they're supposed to go, and thenyou just have to cut them. Since thepads are double wrapped in plastic, Ifind the easiest way is to use a razorblade and a cardboard pad so you canactually cut through it. Usually eachwater block will have a diagram of wherethe pads are supposed to go, but thisone just has little cutouts so you caneasily tell where the pads are going.Then we rinse and repeat for the rest ofthe pads. Get some thermal paste on theGPU, and then we slap this bad boytogether. Personally, if I'm doing acustom loop, I'm going to go ahead andspread the thermal paste out just tomake sure that every little piece ofthat die is covered just to make surebecause I don't want to take this apartand drain the loop. And there you have acustom water block 3090 Ti.","A broken fan? A new fan is like $2-10
You forgot to make sure to use pads different thickness in different locations
I replaced my thermal paste last week and 2 days later started getting 100C temps on the cpu just 5 minutes into browsing. 
Turns out the alcohol made the paste a little too wet so half of the paste literally started leaking downwards till it only covered half the cpu. Decided to properly do everything super slowly and clean all the fans. Now I gots 50C while gaming. :)
I built my 1st custom loop with my 3090Ti a couple years back. Hard tubing length tolerances are surprisingly forgiving and I didn't use anything but straight fittings so there's a lot of bends. I did have to go through a lot of tubing with some mistake but tubing is cheap.
Pain in the ahh? Then I’m your brother
Dude how are you not popular yet, your content is genuinely cool and informative
Thermal pads look like gum sticks
Nice . Keep up the good work.
My man said water block like 45 times.
Good on you for mentioning the thermal paste application. Nobody wants to take all that apart again just for paste
Tip, squish thermal paste on the die with the cooler, then lift the cooler off the die to see where you are missing paste or if you or the cooler has squished it crooked. I’ve never had air pockets in any of the thousands of fixes I’ve done, and it saves a little on having to spread it out like you did. You get to see the paste actually spread and do its job, and if it doesn’t you know where to fix/apply more.
3090ti is prob going to last a pretty long time as far as keeping up with AAA titles
non conductive 5 dot method is always the good option imho , pre-spreading introduces more air pockets. a bit of spillage on the capacitors on the side won't damage them, but even with spillage it won't spread out that far.
The first GPU I ever took apart was a pair of new R7870s that I slapped EK water blocks on. Well one was new the other was a couple months old. xD
Anyone else want to see crossfire and sli come back?
(for anyone wondering it was about the same as the GTX 660)
91% woops.
Damnnn i remember when 14nm was the best crazy how far things are
I wpould recommend using PTM7950 for the GPU instead pf using normal thermal paste because it has a bit better thermal performance. Thouh its expensive it is really good for a project like this one.
that's a lot of thermal paste.. you are filling in voids to get a transfer of heat that is even. When you put a ton of paste on it actually lifts the heat sync off the surface. You get lower heat transfer. You also get a mess. 

all in all a good video though.. Didn't know you could order a block for a card that fits.
Best to wear nitrile gloves when handling the water block so your fingerprints don’t corrode and tarnish the surface.
Обычная MX термопаста от Arctic , Чувак ты серьезно ? На видеокартах нужно использовать только фазовый переход .
first gpu that i ever done this was a friends 2060 super, my headass was so sweaty at the end.
Hitting those tiny metals near the die can literally make it die if you damage them... This was based on my personal experience...
still got my 3090 EVGA
How much did you get it for
If u waterblock it how does the gpu know its still being cooled even tho it has no fans
Nice! 
Doesnt look hard in the slightest i always got scared about it
Quite funny I bought a bykski block for my sapphire Rx 7900 XTX nitro+ card and they gave me CPU instructions for it so I used thermal grizzly putty and thermal grizzly thermal paste on it and assembled it with no instructions and got good temps with it
What gpu block did you use?
My 3080 12GB needs this soo bad, but it would cost more than the GPU is even worth in resale value to get this done . EVGA really crapped the bed with their cooling solution for the 30 series. This thing absolutely roasts itself.
Can you do anything to repair the display ports on a GPU? Been having issues with my 3090.
the ~5th time i took apart a card it finally died. fortunately i doubt it was my fault, it was an aging and poorly made gpu. either way, rip my 5700 xt
use 50% isopropyl
so you got a good card with a broke fan and then you didnt fix it you made it so you will hate it when you have to change something in your system.
I never use anything like that at all to remove heat dope from the GPU or even CPU I just use some tissue and it comes right off even if its hard. But I guess some people just love using chemicals
Why not use thermal paste instead of pads?
how do you know how thicc thermal pad to use?
isnt the 4070 super better then this thing lol
How do u figure out the pad size for a gpu vram

If you are a 5090 sucker use putty and a graphene pad at least.

Tech reviews & Travel tips in cinematic mode.\n\nLets work together! : davidcs2007@gmail.com\n\n\n,"[Music]Hi guys, today's video is sponsored byPuffer Rocks. More on that later.Welcome back guys to a new video. TodayI'm going to show you my gaming desksetup tour. So, let's get into it.Keeping a clean and organized desk isessential for getting the most out ofyour gaming experience. A wellarrangedspace not only boosts focus and reducesdistractions, but also enhancesperformance. Plus, a tidy environmenthelp protect your gear by preventingdust build up that can affect how yourdevices work. In short, a good setupdoesn't just look great, it level upsyour gameplay. So, let's start with thedesk. In previous videos, I already showyou how I built this custom desk bymyself. The wood has a clear finish tocreate contrast with the main wall, andthe table legs are made of metal, makingit very solid desk. They're also paintedin black to match the overall look. Iuse two monitor for different consoles.The smaller one is a 24 in full HDSamsung monitor with a 75 Hz refreshrate. That's why it cost less than$120. Originally, I bought it as asecondary monitor for my PC, but now Iuse it for my Nintendo Switch OLED,which doesn't really need more than 60Hz or 4K resolution. The colors areokay, but don't expect 100%sRGB. This monitor just isn't for that.Honestly, I don't recommend it at all.As you may know from my last video, Ihave my Nintendo Switch OLED connectedto the dock and this monitor. That'swhere I play some of my favorite gameslike Super Smash Bros., Mario Bros. orPokemon. The second monitor is a 27 inLG 4K display. It only has 60 Hz refreshrate, but the image quality isexcellent. I placed it on a customhighrise shelf I made with the same woodfinish as the desk I originally boughtit for editing videos and photos, butnow I use it for gaming, too. While it'snot ideal for fast-paced games, theimage quality and connectivity areawesome. This monitor is connected to mygaming PC. It doesn't have the latestspecs, but it still perform perfectlyfor a casual gamer like me. It's poweredby a Ryzen 5 3.6 6 GHz with 16 GB ofRAM, 2 TB of internal storage, and aNvidia GeForce RTX 2060. I boughted thisPC in 2021. It was my first gamingbuild. With these specs, I can playWarson, FIFA, Dragon Ball, and manyother titles with no problem. Forperipherals, I use a Fifine, whichoffers great sound quality. You canadjust the audio and mute volumedirectly and mute the mic by tapping theicon. Even though it's not a physicalbutton, I didn't just buy the mic. I gotit as a part of a combo that includes amixer. With the mixer, I can controlaudio levels, change my voice, customizebuttons, change the RGB lighting, andmore. By the way, the audio in thisvideo is recorded using this mic so youcan hear it for yourself. Now, let'stalk about the mouse pad or actually thelack of one. Instead of a traditionalmouse pad, I use a custom rock fromPuffy Rocks, today's sponsor. It's anarmor rack for my keyboard. I simplymessaged them on Instagram and asked ifthey could make me a Ruron Noah designand they did it. If you want a customrock like this, feel free to reach outto them. They have a tons of cooldesigns, including this Roron Noah Sororock. For the keyboard, I use amechanical one from Freewolf with brownswitches. To be honest, the only thing Ilike about it's the design. The key cupsare hard to press and the material feelsreally cheap. But what do you expectfrom a $40 wireless keyboard? The truthis, I don't really use keyboards forgaming. I'm more into gaming withcontrollers, especially the Xboxcontroller. I used to play with PS3controllers, but ever since I got myXbox One, I've gotten used to Xboxcontroller. My first pro controller wasthe Power A Xbox Pro controller, butafter 2 years of using it started todiscolor like this. So, I upgraded tothe OG Xbox Elite controller, whichfeatures adjustable tension thumbsticks, a wrap around rubberized grip, ashorter hair trigger locks, and itoffers endless customizations withinterchangeables, components, andexclusive bottom mapping via the Xboxaccessories app. Honestly, it was agreat investment. The mouse I choose isthe Logitech G502 Hero. It's anincredible mouse very quickly. You cancustomize the buttons and the weight.The only downside of this one is thatit's not wireless. The design andquality are perfect for the price. Forheadphones, I've tried several,especially Logitech. I started with theLogitechG332, then tried the wireless G435, andnow I'm using the G335. These headphonesare awesome. The sound quality isperfect. The mic works great. It evenmutes when flip it up and they are superlightweight for long gaming sessions.Below my 27in monitor, I keep myinternet router and an Alexa Show 5. Iuse it to check the time, play music, orask random questions. Between bothmonitors, I have my Belin 15 wattsMaxafe charging station which charges myphone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Back tothe Nintendo Switch. I play usingJoy-Cons with adapters I bought a fewweeks ago along with the original Joycongrip, but let's be honest, Joyconsaren't great. So, I bought this cheapbut awesome Power A controller with aCharizard design. Considering the priceand features, it's a great great option.To take my gaming setup to the nextlevel, I also added lighting.Especially, I installed light barsbehind the monitor from a brand calledit Goovy. These lights completelytransform the vibe of the setup, and youcan customize the colors and brightnesshowever you like. Finally, let's talkabout the two wall shelves. The firstone is decorated with my One Piececollection, a manga, a Trafagalo FunkoPop, and a soro figure. As you probablynoticed, I'm a huge fan of One Piece andPokémon, but my top favorite has alwaysbeen Dragon Ball. I'm currentlysearching for the best Vegeta figure Ican find. I also keep some photos of mylittle nister behind the decoration. Onthe second shelf, I have a Senitu figurefrom the Slayer, a Zelda amiibo, andanother figure that I honestly don'tknow the name of. And if you recognizeit, please let me know in the comments.I also have a small artificial plant.And in the back, I keep some gift andlittle reminders from my girlfriend. So,that is for today's video. I hope youlike it and enjoyed the tour. If youhave any questions, feel free to drop acomment down below. Don't forget tosubscribe and I will see you in the nextone. Chowo chow.","very nice setup brother
Nice setup, and really like that the rug, new sub!

dude you might as well go for a ultra wide monitor 409 inch or 45 inch and then get a small portable monitor as your secondary also your mic arm could be a low profile arm i got the avermedia low profile arm it can do both be a normal arm and a low profile so a 2 in one

This monitor is 1440p 480Hz, and so much sharper and moreaccurate than my current monitor. So, Itook the old one off the wall, I mountedthe new one, plugged everything in, andboom, now I can finally become a probecause this monitor is going to help meget there. So, make sure to like andfollow for","BRO BE GRATEFUL SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE THESE
i mean if you don’t need the old one anymore hit me up
Meanwhile me chilling with my monitor from 15 years ago:
finally bro brings up the moniter from the stream 5 months ago
""need"" is a strong word
Bro Steel on 1440p
Boom there goes your tower watch it crumble feel the power
""My gaming setup sucks""..
BRO NO IT DOES NOT, YOUR LUCKY
be grateful for what you have. i don’t even have a gaming setup
Need vs want. For most ppl the extra 120hz for $400 isn’t worth it at all. I’ve had both the Samsung G60SD and the Asus PG27ADQP. The difference in actual performance is not noticeable even side by side
i need to get off my 2018 laptop ️
I am the only one using a 4k tv 60htz as my moniter and still play games
Need? I needed to upgrade my monitor from 1080p to 1440p because I wasn't utilising my PC to the fullest and it was kinda hurting my eyes. But you totally didn't need to upgrade
Your my favorite YouTuber
You could get a 4k oled as your second monitor, and get an artisan mousepad if you’re thinking about going pro
Can I please have the old one? I don’t even have a monitor and if I could get that it would help me so much with my budget on gaming set up.
my gaming setup sucks: me :gasp:
I still NEED to upgrade he says. GIVE ME THE OTHER MONITOR PLEASE I BEG
im using 60hz overclocked to 75hz i kinda need a ne one, but im broke...
Bro firstly I don't even have a setup yet second instead of a monitor I'm gonna use an old tv
Can i have the older monitor?
Bro a monitor isnt gonna give u more skillsets. You were just fine with a 360hz oled 1440p
If you don’t want the old one, don’t be shy to share️
Poor rage bait attempt
I mean if you hate your old one so much ill take it like damn, people get pro on 120hz
Bro i have a monitor/tv from 2009 that barely turns on for playing Fortnite on Nintendo switch
Me chillin with a $80 Walmart onn monitor and a $609 pc
Is there any way???
Give me the old one
bru some people make $30000 in their lifetime
30 k and you cant get a 560 hrtz
Such a spoiled brat my setup is a tablet a mousepad a keyboard and A 6 DOLLARS MOUSE WITH USELESS SIDEBUTTONS
There is no way that setup is worth 30 k
THAT DOES NOT SUCK MAN WDYM???
can i get the old one i run a 60hz
360hz to 480hz is not a big difference
im grateful for a 75 hz monitor
For the people saying he’s spoiled or whatever sure yeah everyone would be more than happy to have the other monitor but he does this for content he makes the monitor back
me sitting here with my 60hz montior wonddering why he needs 500hz
no way he took off the hat
Give the the old monitor to me, i need it too:)
Give your old monitor pls
Some peaple dont have moniters, be grateful
What keyboard is that???
I could barely afford a 144hz moniter
Yo gutzy, are all your mousepads glass?
This is a sign to not be like this if i ever make it big in youtube
What was your old monitor called because I need a good not expensive option with those specs
Bro thinks a monitors gonna help him get better XD
What do i need to do to get a gaming laptop
Bro me an my 22in 60h monitor
You should give me your old oled monitor
Please google up how to get it to 6500k
Your say your set up is bad but I don’t even have a monitor or and gaming pc
You will be better than zywoo
give it
I mean if you don’t like it I’ll take it of your hands
Day 170 of asking for a new pc everyday till I get one
I really hope this is a joke
Dude… rich people problems right here, if 360hz is apparently slow, Usain Bolt can’t beat a sloth

Long overdue. We'refinally building this gaming setup at astudio. And we're at where any goodgaming setup begins. Orange County,California. Let's go. I don't know whatI'm getting. How much you think I'mgoing to spend?[Music]I have a checklist of things that weneed for this setup. Starting with thePC. I already have one, but we'll seewhat they have because maybe I'llupgrade my PC. Hey, of course we come onthe most busy day. 5080s. 5080s. I wasreally hoping for a 5090. Maybe we won'tupgrade the PC today. I really want onethough. Low key. Should I just get itanyways even though it's not a 5090? No.How long you think I need? Long enough.Six. [ __ ] one of these. Oh, they gotcable management stuff. Oh, I need that[ __ ] bro. Yeah, you do. My [ __ ] Weshould make a video fixing Josh's setupone day. We should show him my PC withthe leg stand. That [ __ ] tilt, dude.There's a lot of zip ties here, but tobe honest, zip ties are overrated andit's a lot of work if you want to takeit down. Something like this is a littlebetter because it's velcro, like velcroties, and it's easier to take off. Youdon't have to cut them. Something likethis as well, just to like tidy up thecables together. I know I'm going toforget something. That's That's theproblem. You have the Ethernet cablealready, right? Yeah, we need that. Ishould have had a plan. I never have aplan. It's like the most boring microcenter haul ever. We'll get some morecool stuff. What the What is that? Yougot to buy a new camera. No, that'sscared me. I'm broke. Hey Josh, you needa new blow dryer. Tell me why I walkedin his room once. He's using anelectronic air duster to dry his hair.I'm like, ""Bro, I got one. I should usemine."" It wasn't even blowing air, but Iwas blowing dust exposing me. You don'tneed no RGB. Oh, check. That boy tall.You might need Sony monitors. Sonymonitors. I think we have one. Probablynot the same one cuz this new ever. Oh,that's a new new one. Yeah, this onejust came out probably have this oneright here. It looks like has like thesame stand. So, this one's 480 Hz. Wait,they're both 480 Hz. Wait a minute.Similar specs. It's 2K 480. This is 2K480. Is that same size? 27 in. I'll beright back, man. We're in the monitorsection. It was looking grim. Normally,I'd also need to pick up a monitor, butI already have one at home uh thanks toSony. They have one in stock and I'm washoping to have a dual monitor setup, sothey're going and they're grabbing itfor me right now. Oh, you got it for meright there. Here you go. All right,guys. Oh, it is the same monitor. Is itthe same monitor? Bang. Yeah. Yeah, thesame name. Sort of the same box. Is thisthe last one? It's the only one. Thankyou, guys. Have a good one. Let's go.With this monitor, it's the first timeI'm not buying monitor mounts because ofthe design of the monitor mount. It'sactually pretty sick. And I'll show youguys more later. I think we're good.That's a wrap for Micro Center. UnlessJosh, you want some? Yeah. $10,000. Buyas much as you want. $50 for a cable? Idon't know if I want it that bad. $50?Oh, it's the goat. The goat. This islike the LeBron of esports, bro. It'scrying out.Actually, is the goboy. What you know about this? Come on,bro. Stop playing. What you know aboutthis?Only one they had.Is that crazy?[Music]Help me out.[Music]Black and white. One, two. Car has aura.You already know what where you at.Somehow we always end up here in everyvideo, right Josh? Like I swear I don'tcome here all the time. Yeah, we're justgetting like a bunch of desk accessoriesand a countertop for the table. [ __ ] inthe car, bro. What? Don't say that.[Music][Music]It's been a while since you guys haveseen the studio. This area is a totalmess, but we're working on it. We gotsome small progress here. The KiloEscape has made a return. We got somerandom jumbosized Pokémon cards. Shoutout to Cracks Toys, my boy Matt. SomePro Grails. This little area is kind ofcool. We got Josh eating this littleshell. I love this area. This plant ishuge now. I got this plant a year ago.Look how much it's grown. It's all theway over here now. You guys rememberthis living room. We turn around. We gota live streaming setup. By the way, letme turn this light on. Much better. Thishas been a lot of fun. Bubble M is thegreatest Pokémon card ever made. Car'shere.But yeah, this is like the last part ofthe studio. I really need some seriouswork. There's this big wall over here.I'm going to clear all of this out andthen build my new gaming setup.It's been a while since I actually hadWell, okay. I have a gaming setup athome, but it's kind of like a makeshiftsetup. Plan to have this place for along time. So, this setup is very, verypermanent. But also, we're taking a verydifferent approach than his setups inthe past. I still stream, not as much.So, the main focus here is it lookinggood, not the functionality. Although,I'm not going to build a setup that'simpractical to use.[Music]One problem. So, tabletop thing that webought, it's too small cuz like thispiece is supposed to connect the twolegs, but um as you can tell, it'staller than the desk. And then this thisis the top. The depth of the desk isalso smaller. I realized what I didwrong cuz when I bought this frame, itwas supposed to originally be for abigger tabletop. I get what you mean.So, it's going to be like hanging likeYeah. Yeah. So, we got a new one. Oh mygoodness. Things always go wrong.Finally, since the last clip that youguys saw, it's been about 3 or 4 days. Iwent to the bay, visited family, andalso went to a Warriors game. We went ona whole mission today just to get thistable top. I know it doesn't look likeanything special, and trust me, itisn't, but it's exactly what I waslooking for.So, this is birch plywood. I got it fromHome Depot. It's finished already. Um, Imight have to stand up and fix up acouple random things, but it's wood.It's never going to be perfect, and I'mperfectly fine with it being unfinishedor like not perfect. Long story short,we went to a Home Depot. They had thewood that we wanted. Pause. But themachine to cut the wood didn't work. Andoriginally this was 4 ft deep, which istoo long for a desk, but I feel likethis is basically perfect. Now, themoment of truth is making sure that thisthing fits on this thing. 1,000% Ishould have measured it. Oh, barely.It's like an inch. So, I don't know ifyou can see,but yeah, we're good. It clears. This isgoing to be a sick desk. By far the mostunique desk I've ever built. And it'ssuper simple. So, perfect. Step numberone, we got to build this frame. Then,I'm debating whether or not I actuallywant to put or drill or glue thecountertop to the frame itself or justput it on top and then put like rubberor something so it doesn't, you know,scrape or scratch. We'll cross thatbridge when we get there.[Music]What is in here?Sounds like screws.Voila.Tons of them.These are like the little feet thing.And then there's a little beam in themiddle to make sure everything's stable.Hey,perfect. No, this is exactly how I wantit. This desk is huge. This desk ishuge. The way we rock. Scary. Live lifeon the edge. It's It's massive, bro.Hey, it looked better, huh? Big olddesk. Have you ever seen a gaming setupdesk this big? Yeah, it looks like adining table. Lookie. Nice. 3 2 1[Applause]Weno.[Music][Music]What do you think? Are youall the way? No.Nice.Cool. So, desk is mostly done. This isprobably the coolest desk I've everowned. Not the most unique desk, but Ithink it's pretty different for likegaming setups. What you think, Josh?Yeah. Jump on it.It finally break it out. Okay, so fromhere, I'd probably normally startbuilding the actual setup itself. What Iwant to do is start putting this stuffon the wall. Start with mounting thestuff. Have these pegboards. Probably goeven from the middle, left and right. Ialso have this shell, which I'llprobably go offset onto this sidebecause I already have a basketball loopright there.[Music]I want it to be like[Music][Music]Can't help myself. See what this feelslike with a real chair. I've alwayswanted a desk. It's huge. It's a new dayand I recruited alltime greats.He brought in the big guns. Oh yeah. Ialways had this dream to get thismassive desk, but also I didn't realizethat it would like bend this much. So Itook a quick trip to IKEA and yeah,let's do this earn stuff. Well, time toget to work. Since this desk is so thin,I have to use like the thinnest screwsever. Like, they're so tiny. What? It'llbe fine, right? Yeah.They're um half an inch because the deskthickness is 38 of an inch. Y'all shouldsee my POV right now.Big ass eyes. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. So,y'all see I think you guys can see howmuch it's bending just by that thatspot.Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have muchfaith in these little screws, butOh, if you're wondering why I have twowhite dogs, one is our friend. Yeah.Looks good. No more bend. Missionaccomplished. So, with the desk done, wecan now get to building the actual setupitself. Monitor stand is so cool. Theyprobably get mad at me for doing this,too, huh? And any good setup starts withthe monitor. Thankfully, while Sony sentme that one, I bought this one. Andalso, this video is sponsored by Sony.Micro Center had one last one of theSony M10S monitor. For any setup ofmine, at least especially gaming setups,you need to have at least two monitors.The Sony M10S is a monster performerdisguised as a minimalistic productivitymonitor. The chassis and design languagescream simple, but the specs scream topof the line. 480 Hz, 27 in OLED, QHD1440p, small bezels, easy setup,lightweight, minimalistic stand, and athin display with a innovative coolingsystem. I genuinely can't name anythingwrong with the M10s. Oh yeah, and as Imentioned earlier, this is the firsttime I'm completely ditching a deskmount. I still have nightmares trying tomount 30 lb monitors. Not fun at all.But with this, I feel like I'm notsacrificing anything at all. All whilehaving no compromise on performance, I'mall in. I've been able to use my otherSony M10S for about a month already.Loved it so much I went out of my way tobuy another and Sony doesn't even knowthat. While they are the sponsor oftoday's video, I will say if thismonitor has taught me anything, it'sthat the days of going for the highestrefresh rate monitor and ignoringeverything else are over for me. I stillremember when 240 Hz was all the craze.Now double that and add every premiumquality of life feature into awell-designed chassis and you'll findthis monitor, the Sony M10S. You cancheck it out with the link in my bio.Sony, thank you again for sponsoringthis video and helping me build my dreamgaming setup for like the 75th time.Okay, so this is going to go up. So thenthis is going to go like this. And thenthey like[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]$50.[Music]It was orange. So I had to[Music]like this thing's a smiley face.real ones from like my community and thestreams know the importance of thesmiley face. So, if you know, you know,we also had to cut it. Shout out toErnstell for the idea. I would havenever never thought of that. Hey,hey,it should be in the middle of this andthis way. No, I don't really know wherethe[Laughter]Give me that.A little cricket. Like just shimmy me itthis way. Just Oh,yeah. That's good. Perfect. Thisactually does look cool.All right. Taking this off.All right. So, this is a magazine I gotplaying basketball, but it's signed byKD. Oh, wait. I should move this.Thought this would be a good place forit, too. And it's orange with thepegboard. I didn't know what to put onit, but I think it looks okay for now. Idon't need to overdo it. Yeah.[Music]I always wanted this mic cuz it's white.Oh my god. Are you okay?Is it okay? We're good. Is it recording?Yeah. Oh my god. Chat broke his lens.How much is the lens? Two racks. Betterget a million views. I don't even wantto record anymore. Where should I putthis? Well,thank God. Hey, Sony, how about wesponsor a lens video?[Music][Music]It's day three building in the setup andtoday we're going to finish it. Right,Josh? Mhm. I'm about to I'm about totell himwhat theall my hard work. Here's a littleprogress report of where we're at.Thanks to Ernstell for helping meyesterday. Put it on the desk. Hey Har,what you think? No. No. Come back. Har,say cheese. The crazy part is that shegoes on the table at home. Um, afterWhat happened? Huh? Still my toe. No.What happened to my tripod?We got this picture up yesterday.Decorated a little bit, of course. Gotthe monitor set up. I put the 151Charizard right here. I think I want toput the full evolution. I feel like thatwould be sick. That sucks. What? Youdon't got it.You did it again.That's you, bro. It's tough. Remember myold sub um sub emotes? S smiley faces.Josh, if I put you in charge of cablemanagement, you think you can do it?Do you mind? It's everywhere. Today,we're starting with cable management cuzclearly uh well, I don't have that manycables plugged in yet, but it's the mostimportant part of any any setup, period.I got this big old desk. So, that's mymission. This shouldn't be that hard.I'm going to start with this powerstrip. We got to get it mounted righthere. Um, I don't really have an exactidea of where I'm going to put it. Ijust kind of put it somewhere and thencall it a day. This a good spot, right?All right. Can you hold that side up?This is so weird. Hurry up, bro. No, I'mlowkey enjoying my time down here. [ __ ]Hurry up.All right. I should do the other side,huh? Yeah.Oh my dog.Why are you still here?I kind of want to move the uh cablemanagement thing to the left, too.This is going to be pretty boring, butumlots of cables. I'll update you when Ihave something else.maybe some advice or insight for peopletrying to manage their cables. A problemmost people run into when building agaming setup is that their cables aretoo short and that's why they can'tcable manage it. Definitely invest insome longer cables. I usually if it's ashort distance, I do at least 6 ft. Thisone's 6 ft. This one's 10 ft.And I even got an extension for like apower extension just in case I neededit. Things like this always make adifference. In the past, I would gosuper crazy with the cable management,but in all honesty, like I'm lazy,especially now. So, I just bought thislittle like rack thing. I'm just goingto put all the cables on there. It's notthat big of a deal to me. As long as thecables aren't touching the floor orhanging, um, then I did my job. Andespecially cuz I know I'm the type ofperson that likes tochange gear. And see, like, look howshort this cable is. But I'm the type ofperson person that likes to change gearand nicely cable managing everything isnot the move when that's the type ofperson I am. Also, I know I used tonever use these things, but somemonitors have like a little cablemanagement thing right here. Definitelyuse them because they're there for areason. Also, when you have a really bigdesk, um cables are going to be likethis. And the only way to really make itlook nice are cable sleeves.So, you know, the cables won't be gone.You can't magically just make themdisappear,but at least you can make it look neat,and that's that's the whole goal here.I'm going to cut this, but I'll show youguys what it looks like after.Would you look at that?Careful. All right. So, I'm in a littlebit of a predicament. I want to put thePC like tucked off in the corner foronce because I always put it on theright side of the desk, but I didn'tthink about how the cables would just besticking out over here and that kind ofit don't make me feel good. So Josh saidI should put a plant here. I was like,""Well, Josh, you actually had a goodidea for once."" This is what I decidedon. I just moved that plant to theground and pushed the um side tableback. But we'll plug everything in andthen I'll try my best to use the cablesleeves to make it look kind of tidy.Obviously cables are cables and they'regoing to be there, but hopefully itlooks okay.One thing about me, it's about thedetails. Got an orange XLR cablefor absolutely no reason. I don't knowif you can tell, but I've been likingorange recently.[Music]Make sure to keep your XLR cablesseparated from the rest of your cables,or else you'll get static in your mic.And another thing, these Velcro ties areway better than zip ties, no matter whatanyone says. Not my best work, but umgood enough for me. You got nuts in hisback. Yeah.What the Why are you not petting me? Hedon't want you to do that no more. Whyyou still crouch like that?Yeah,yeah,yeah. Look, look. It's like I'm racingon father time. Hard to see the visionwhen you only see dollar signs. Stick toplan A cuz the B feel like compromise.Thinking [ __ ] sweet. This the like theydon't advertise. Supposed to use yourvoice, but when you do, you getostracized. Overall, I'm really happywith how it turned out. Feel like theblue here contrasts really well with allthe orange. I added some little detailsbecause well, I love this bag and it'sone of the coolest collabs in gaminghistory up there. Of course, I had toput the Dreamcast. Something about theart on these boxes just looks so cool.And it's nice to have this much space onthe right side of my desk cuz usually myPC is there. And as much as I love myPC, which is still my old PC, the onethat I had at at the house in my setupthere, I just moved it. I like howsimple it looks while still being verycolorful, lots of contrast, and at theend of the day, still me. That chairisn't permanent. I have another chairover there, but um yeah, it's just kindof here for now. Every time I've donelike an all-white setup or a mostlyblacked out setup, it didn't well, itlooked cool, but it didn't really feellike me. This This feels like me. If youremember my original setups, there was alot of black and white contrast. I thinka lot of people try to go for one or theother. The white and the black justcontrast so well. More minimalistic yetstill unique and interesting. Let meknow you think and appreciate you guysfor watching. I'll work on a studio tour","i think the desk legs are upside down, that metal bar going across the floor is supposed to lay under the top part of the desk so it wont sag
all of lough’s eras are combining into one!

personally don't like the simple plain look but I can see how it would match the studio more than an over kill RGB setup. nice
Sick sick. Was crossin my fingers the wrist rest and mouse stand would make an appearance but i'm sure you have the setup the way you want it.
A set up man, I luv ur content, been watching u since 2020.

never in my life i imagine seeing dino with kitchen products ads. 

bro is a breadwinner
""I'm coming for your jobs"" is the craziest shit to say after pressing a button on a machine hilarious
Now we need to see the grill
Can confirm that Butter has culture. It has a finace podcast biweekly. Its also a relationship guru.
""Glacier filtered water""
The butter is so cultured it’s fighting for its rights
bro is really transitioning from gaming channel to cooking right before our eyes
Mans butter got me feeling like a peasant.
This a cooking channel now bro ...slowly slowly it'll be an all-rounder channel
Gordon Ramsey: It's RAW
We're going from gaming to cooking ahh moment
“Are u gaming”
“No babe I’m making bread”
This is the most brilliant sponsor ad I've ever seen
That's prolly the best butter joke
This guy is quickly becoming one of my favorite creators
Damn that production thooo
he just threw all the ingredients in and skipped the boring part and let the machine magically make the bread!
This man was born gifted not just in games but advertising and he is funny unreal.
Masasabi ko lang jan, TEKENLOGIA!
dino is other level hhahahaha as a pinoy i love him
i might be spoiled af for saying this but i love how he's flexing stuff i can use on a daily basis.
Wow. Now this is premium cooking channel.
Waiting for him to go fishing
Wtf... you are so funny!!
Heres comes the cooking arc
HE'S TOO GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!
I love their bread makers!!!!!!!!! They are so good!!!
Was expecting Dino to make Pandesal
Dino is so humble.
his wife jumpscared me because i always hear that one question
that actually looks so good
Damn, I liked this video twice organically cause I love it
Bro I wanna see some chicken adobo cooking
I love how he included Nick like he's the top ""chef"" on the platform
The wit and the humor all in one place. Bro, you got my respect.
Dude makes 1 dollar bread and threatens Gordon Ramsay for his Jobs
This character you’ve created is hilarious, Dino you’ve provided me with many many laughs. Thank you I really wish I could be successful in a similar way.
He literaly told the chef's that he is coming for their jobs using a breadmaker well done
Welcome back to TLC.
Bro im really disappointed that you don't have a maid apron
The callouts are crazy
You got me on the podcsat part! HAHAHAHAH BALIW KA TALAGA DINO! HAHAHHA
Bro literally said ""Hand selected, Ultra Premium bread flour...""
Love how you imitate gordon with ""in,"" lol
He’s slaying it
I love how he throws shade on real chefs when all he did was throw ingredients in a machine
You Played Doom Eternal but you never played Stella Blade
That cultured butter line kills me.
This channel has evolved from a gaming channel to a 3am appliances show
since when this this became cooking channel. I just took 2 week break from youtube
The Cultured grass fed butter got me

i love the Ms Rachel ""in""
Dang bro u didn't have to cook us like that.
Since you mentioned Gordon, I'll only believe it if Gordon Ramsay gives your bread an approval
Baking bread = 
Coming for their jobs =
That might be fine bread but I have a suggestion for a bread thats better. You will need 3 cups (about 360g) whole wheat flour, 1,5 cups (360ml) warm water, 2 tablespoons honey (or maple syrup), 2 tablespoons olive oil (or melted butter), 2 teaspoons active dry yeast, and 1,5 teaspoons salt. If you want, throw in some sunflower seeds or oats for extra texture. When its done, let it cool on a rack before slicing. If it comes out a bit dry, add a splash more water next time. 
If you want it even healthier you should make sourdough bread. The body can digest sourdough way better if your stomach cant handle the other ways that good.
Take it from someone coming from the land of the bread
Collab na ni lumpia queen
Dino is a true Filipino, because we Pinoy's are mostly in the kitchen. ;)
Cultured butter fighting for its rights got me
Cant believe he didn't say ""bread, out""
I need you to use that giller to make giller to
Bro just auto baked a and challenged the world class master chefs
Probably the richest Filipino ever
imagine gordon ramsay come to his house to judge him
That isn't premium until you make milk bread
""Cultured butter"" must be the most expensive ingredient on the list
He's Advertising All Those Ingredients

I don't know why, but this reminds me of how McDonalds (and other franchises) swap from colourful, thematic food outlets to the minimal, toneless, brutalist restaurants.
Worst error has to be a hot take or the worst ragebait, a gaming setup is meant for gaming and a comp setup does that perfectly
Wooting 60he is crazy
Go for the wooting 80he and the razer viper v3 pro is a alienware 360hz monitor and the hyperX cloud 3 headset you should go for the artisan zero mid or soft mouse pad, and for the pc try to get at least a 4070ti super and a ryzen 7 or a cord i9
yeah got any tips on how i can save money for a gaming desk or a monitor
This is better than rgb why im doing this as my setup
Hey can u give a phone tour like of ur lockscreen and homescreen layout?
crazy how much the consumer market is dictated by TikTok trends. You don't have to stop liking something just because it's not popular anymore.. That's genuinely sad. Validation seeking has never been higher amongst any generation to date.
Logitech gpro superlight 2 and wooting 60he hits hard
For a comp setup that’s the best equipment
Logitech G pro wireless x2 the Artizans mouse pad hyper x cloud 3s and an oled monitor.
wooting he60 and gpro superlight
Wooting, skypad and finalmouse mouse. Thats it
Some of y'all are influenced by social media trends at a disturbing level. If your likes and dislikes are constantly changing based on the content that you're drowning yourself in, what do you think that says about your personality? (hint: you don't have one)

So,let's get right into it. First, we'regoing to start off with the keyboard.It's the Razer Husman Mini. Love it. UhI may or may not have switched some ofthe key caps uh with or not. Yeah. Yeah.Keycaps and some of the switches becausesome of them broke. I have no idea how.So yeah, that's it's pretty good. Thenwe have my PulsarX2 V2.Love it. It's pretty light if you askme. Soyeah,here we have my main monitor. It's a MSIRed Dragon. I don't know the exactmodel, but it's 250 Hz. I use 250 Hz,though. I just use 240.Sothis this is my uh second monitor. Gotthis yesterday. It's been pretty good sofar. It's uh 100 Hz cuz, you know, it'sa second monitor when you're reallyusing it that much, so it's not going tobe that good, but it's good to me, youknow. And this is my light bar. I don'tknow what brand it's from. Uh I'll tryto find it and then put it in thedescription maybe.And this is myum mic.It's what you heard in the uh the introof the video. So, yeah, as you can hear,it's pretty crisp.I don't know the exact brand either, butit's pretty good. This boomis just an Amazon basics one. Not thatreally good. Don't really.And um here's my high ground mouse padthat's been insanely good to me so far.I've put this thing in the washingmachine so many times and it's been ithasn't like been destroyed or anything.People say that putting it in thewashing machine is not good for your uhyour mouse pads, but I don't reallybelieve. All right, so here's the PCthat y'all love to talk trash about.Yeah. Yand from now on I'm only going to beupgrading my PC. Okay. So, I recentlybought uh more sticks of RAM for the PCcuz currently it only has 8 GB of RAM.So, now it's going to have16 or 32. I don't know yet. I'll see howmuch money I get. And then I'm going toupgrade the GPU and thenwe'll just go from there. All right.So yeah, that was my updated set oftour. Hope you all like it and uh seeyou on the next one.

This is the second time I have built a PC, my first PC build was over 15 years ago, so over time that PC could no longer play newer games, so it was time for a new build, since the old one was not salvageable. With this PC I can turn the graphics settings all the way up to ultra, even graphic resource hungry games such as Star Wars Outlaw, runs buttery smooth on ultra. Plus building with the HYTE Y70 was so easy, and PC started on the first boot without any issues, I was extremely overjoyed!

Then Iwas getting a black screen. The heightY70 with a screen kids.That is my case. It's a height by 70 andit has going to have a touchcreen whichI unboxed it for a YouTube video. Soit's right here with the accessories andthen all my PC parts. We'll have it alllisted down below in the description,but let's go ahead and start opening allthese parts, laying them out, and thenbuilding the PC. All right, so the firstthings first I'm going to be doing is mymotherboard. This is the motherboard Iwent for. Now, I did do um an unboxingbecause I took it out, so there'snothing in there, but I do need to stillget the cables that I left behind.First things first, I need to installthe CPU. Building this, I really wantedto build this for like gaming. That'sjust my priority is to make sure that Icould game and put my graphics on high.Um, there was not a lot of, I shouldsay, of these um, CPUs to choose from,but this one really looked like it hadgood specs, so I went for that one.Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music]I like to know is the CPU is actuallythe most like delicate thing to install.But why is it the most hardest? And Idon't mean like difficulty. I meant likeactually putting down pressure on thisand you have to gently put it on. Itseems like it's so delicate yet it's youhad to do too much to it. Also, it'sgood to save this because you never knowif you have to somehow warranty your CPUfor any kind of reason. If you're stilla new warranty and you need to put thisright back to protect the motherboard.All right, so next up is my RAMs. And Igot the RAMs from Ing Group with theseRAMs. And there's a 64 GB of RAMs.[Music]So, this is going to be my storage I'mgoing to be using. I'm going to be usinga 2TB from MSI. Now, the only thing isabout the storage. I feel like 2TB isstill not enough. Um, I feel like maybe4TB. I would love to get another SSD andso have like four, even more I'm finewith. Um, it just feels like because alot of my games are like 1 gig eachalmost. I have several games that arelike that. So, 2DB I feel like is goingto run out fast. But for now, this is mystarter. And then later on, I'll just goahead and upgrade and put another SSD inthere.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Music]Right.[Music]So, I got the this liquid cooler um fromMSI and it's the Mag Core Liquid E360in white.[Music]These hands are so pretty.Look at that. Oh, that looksI am super excited to see what thislooks like once I get this all hookedup.[Music]Is it?All right. I have to check and I need tosee if it has umthething with the name now.Uh let's see.Thermal paste. Once I saw it, I actuallyknew that what it's called.I was looking for this.That's good because I kind of wasworried. I was like, if I don't have theremote paste, I would have to go get it.And unfortunately, like my nearest myelectronic store is all closed right nowbecause it's night time. But thankgoodness they come with their own paste.And I'm kind of glad because I might asI rather use what comes with the actualcooler[Music]where the water cooler was actuallygoing to go. I'm just like lookingbecause I'm used to being able to takethis off and then just like install thisright into the water cooler, but I don'tknow how you take it out. I might haveto look at a video. The reason I can'ttake this top part out for my watercoloris because there's these two screwsright here. So that's why I couldn'ttake it out. So let me go ahead andunscrew that then.Heat. Heat. N.[Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]Heat.[Music]Heat.[Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]Jesus.[Music][Music][Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music][Music]I was a little confused actually when Ifirst turned it on. Like I was seeingall these like diagnostic like lightsgoing on and then I was getting a blackscreen and now I got the window screengoing on but getting a black screen andI didn't know what was going on but Ikind of forgot to hit delete button andto take me to the boot screen. Um, butthen I finally figured that out. Got itto boot screen and then I changed outthe priorities to boot from myto boot from my USB stick back here. Andnow it shows me my Windows prompts. Sonow I need to go install my Windows 11and get the drivers. Now this is notwhere I'm going to have my PC at becauseyou can see my monitors is currentlyoff. I have back there my um height Y60and I need to put my Y70 back thereinstead. But I didn't know if it wasgoing to boot or if I have to likediagnose more. So that's why I hooked itup to my secondary monitor. And then Ijust moved my keyboard and mouse. I hadto disconnect, as you can see down here,my height front panel because thatbecame my main monitor and it wasshowing me BIOS on this and I could notread like BIOS was super tiny. So Idisconnect that and now it's only on mymain.[Music]And this is the case I used. It's aheight by 70 with a screen kit. This isone of my favorite part of well one ofmy favorite parts because I have there'sso many parts like for instance thiskind of like kind of like look. I reallylove that because it reminds me of StarWars. Star Wars has those kind ofelements and so it gives me like areally Star Wars futuristic um vibe tothe case. But yeah, it's also atouchcreen and I really love it that youjust can move around and you can likejust play around with you can just movethis around and play around with thecase. It is like super cute. You can putlike any kind of widgets you want inhere. I have my media player. I havethese cute like emojis on here. Um, Ihave a chip that I put here is the GIF.I have my calculator. So, if you want tocalculate some numbers on here. Um, andthen of course my beginning just I alsohave here is my weather. I'll have myclock. It's kind of good to have myclock because it kind of keeps me ontrack and be like, ""Oh, it's kind ofgetting late."" Okay. Um, and then I alsothen I usually keep a GIF right here,but for now I took off the GIF because Ihave this wallpaper. But usually it'llbe a GIF depending on like what theme ofeither Star Wars or something else.[Music]So, you playing?Let me know in the comments down below.What is your favorite Final Fantasygame? It's definitely Final Fantasy 7.It's been the most longunning game thatI've been playing. It's such a longseries. It's definitely one of myfavorites and I can't wait to continueto keep playing.[Music]Heat. Heat.[Music][Music]John says hope unfortunately it's findtime which I feel like he[Music]","Love the case. Final Fantasy 10 is my favorite. ️
Clever girl did a clever build
Uaa love your PC build! Love the color too, Love that they've released more fun colors!

And the first step is dealingwith this situation. Having your PC onthe floor is not as bad as people say itis, but it does make it harder for cablemanagement. So, we're just going toThere we go. Before I start pluggingstuff back in, let's make sure all thesecables are really necessary. Like thisone. Definitely not. Now, usually Iwould plug everything into a cheap powerstrip, but this time I decided to go forthis unit.I don't want to go too far because thesescrews are too long. They will gothrough the desk. I screwed into theside instead so I can mount the UPS likethat. This can keep the power on forlike 6 hours during an outage. It canprotect against surges. And from here,you can't even see it. Now thateverything is reorganized and pluggedback in, the last thing to do isactually hide the cables. Everythingback here just gets bundled and ziptied. And then just wrap them up in asleeve like this. Using some zip tiesand the screws that I screwed inearlier, I kind of suspended up thepower supplies like this. And then allof this gets zipped up, too. This mighthave taken me like 3 hours, but that'ssome of my best work right there.[Music]","For a very short 5 seconds I was so proud that no one commented “Carter do the thug shake” what a glorious 5 seconds
Of course bro has no phone case

I will say, having gotten that same UPS, it won't quite last 6 hours with a gaming computer running on it. That capacity is more for shutting things down safely, which is still a huge boon if power goes out.
Subtle flex of the fold 7
that view is actually majestic asf ️
It will keep it running for 6 minutes not 6 hours, unless they figured out a way to put a powerwall 3 sized battery to this thing
Still waiting for that cyber truck in 2028
shleerp fixed the bitrate!
Where did you get that desk
Shleerp approves of the outro carter
Yo you make me want to get a pic set up which I wish I had can you tell me what I should get to play basic games like Fortnite PUBG and stuff like that plz plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzzzzz love your videos btw
Real ones remember his setup reviews, the old Carter would be appalled by that cable management
It’s funny to think there’s new subs who just assume Carter has always had one of the “retro outros”
smart....good outro
W setup
Eight hours gone by and Parker still didn't make a video about the Z Fold on his table...
Nice
Window behind the setup is a crime
The PH outro was by far the best
We're finally going back to the old days with this outro!
Why is shleerp always commenting
What was the thing you put on the side of your desk as I need one

Can you and a link for the power bank thing please

Good job Carter 🫡
W set up bro
Wow great ideere to mount it plug side up now your going to get tons of dust in it and maybe have a little cosy campfire some day
OUTRO RAAGGGHHH
Fire aotro brooo
His monitor is coocked
Make a long term video pls
The outro go hard
Nice outro.
Personally, I dont use zip ties but the zip sleeves for cable management
That looks amazing
Finally we got some more of those pixels
Bro the outro
FULL SETUP TOUR WHEN... THE WINDOW LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL
you really should make a long form video of your setup
Jesus, that is a lot of cables
Make carters setup great again 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Love the outro
Thats actually so clean
Cater, I know you probably wont see this but, I'm looking at XOTIC PC's and found a pc with a 5060, 15-13100F, MSI b760M Project Zero, 750W, 32GB ddr5 600mhz,, 1tb nvme ssd, 120mm rgb bk tower cooler, black fans with windows 11 home for $1,282.00 is it a good price? Or can I find something better? I really need help..
what's the name of the product?
Don’t forget Velcro ties next time instead of zip ties. Way easier to breakdown the setup later
I really wish more cables came in other colors than black.
Nobody talking about the z fold on his desk

And he's highkey beengriefing our CS games, so I figured itwas time to give him an upgrade. Ibaited the rest of the five stack andcoming to hang out by telling them we'dplay the latest AAA title. I'veaccumulated so many PC parts over theyears, and not all of them areaesthetic. So, those are the parts we'regiving to my friend, and I'm teachingChat how to build a PC today as well.Stick it in.Sticking it in. I'm shoving. We'regiving him an Intel 14700 K with anASRock Nova Z790 motherboard, 32 GB ofDDR5 Corsair Dominator RAM, a 1 TBTESamsung SSD, a 1000 W power supply, andthe Gigabyte 7900 XTX. That's all goingin the Thermaltch V270 case. This oneactually comes in Snow White, butremember, I took one apart to make theperfect matcha case. So, this one is theStormtrooper black and white leftovercase. I ended up working on the cablemanagement while Chad did the rest ofthe build just to make things go alittle bit faster. This is also my firsttime ever using the height thick Q60cooler. Oh this shit's heavy asThis is where I lowkey started gettingworried about whether everything wouldfit or not. And the top mount for thiscooler isn't ideal with the cablerouting, but it's literally impossibleto fit the GPU with this cooler in theside for this case. In terms of thecolor scheme, everything matchestogether so well, though. It only tookus 2 hours to build this PC, which ishonestly pretty impressive. We took abreak from Mario Kart to get all thedrivers and Windows installed. Andhere's what the PC looks like with allthe RGBs and the thick Q60 cooler LCDon. The LCD for this kind of looks likea phone. And you can change the face todisplay temps, but in this case, weuploaded a custom gift. My friend isliterally going from an Intel 7th gen toa 14th gen and his GPU was the 1080. Wealso brought some peripherals tocomplete the setup and then we went overto his house to help him set it up. Hehad this nasty super old Corsairkeyboard, so I thought it was fitting tobring him the K70 Pro, which is actuallyRapid Trigger, so it'll help him strafeCS. I don't even want to know whathappened on this mouse pad, but I gothim a new one from ESP Tiger with abunny on it. It's actually so cute andit kind of reminds me of his dog. And tocomplete the setup, I had to get him the10 mouse from Pulsar because it's only47 g. My boy better be hitting flicksacross the map with this. And here isthe final setup that has been officiallypimped out by PGE. Let me know what youguys think and fall for more aesthetictech reviews.","Crazy to have that build facing the wall
I’m still using an Intel 3rd gen i7. Your friend is so lucky to have you.
I added a GTX1080 to it a few years ago. I used to have a GTX660.
Crazy nice looking build but all of that and ITS FACING THE WALLL GIVE THE PC RESPECT!!
That tissue box next to mousepad yeah we know what happened to his old mousepad
that was a THICK AIO damn
Update that bios if you haven’t already. Those cpus tend to explode and can take other components when it does.
The typa friend I need fr
He’s so lucky i’m still on the PS4
Arctic cooler got competition for radiators impossible to fit into cases now.
No way ur friends with the GOAT Chet, been a fan since his TSM coaching days
The only thing I can’t stand is the 1tb ssd, might as well go for the 2tb. I have a 2 and I’m already running out of space and I just built this setup
I love your channel and your content so so much i watch it almost everyday
I'm still using 
i5 3330
GT 710
8GB Ram
512 GB SSD .....

And I'm finally getting a new PC soon.
i5 12400f
RTX 3070
32 GB Ram
1TB Nvme

So excited man
I think sticking it in would be the best part of building the PC
Noo! Facing at the wall? Bro
Probably having issues intel instability issues if you have build new gaming pc so make sure check latest bios update versions if you don't update the bios will get it slowly cpu fried up when gets break the voltages caused by to disconnect pci express gpu any games loading to crash and pcie nvme m.2 will get bsod when loading the windows os and windows installer will get bsod so make sure return contect intel rma support or switch amd is recommended to finding the best ryzen x3d or x cpus
You sure thats just a friend
Don't forget to do a bios update for your 14700 K because the the Intel 13th and 14th generation processors have microcode issues make sure you update the bios and select the default Intel profile
Criminal to have the PC on the left like that 
Even tho it was a “parts bin” build it came out looking pretty sick
Is that condensation on his side panel, or just… a shit ton of dust?
The box of tissues. A man of culture I see
Wish i have friends like them who can donate parts for PC but also help and teach you how to build one too. Real friends
Make sure to do a bios update for the 14700k
To be honest, fitting the CPU Chip in the socket is the only thing I'm not confident about, else I can create any kind of pc I want. Its all like putting blocks together
7900xtx is a god gpu choice
Congratulations for the new pc setup.Can i have the old one
She is beautiful what a lucky guy to have a great friend to hook you up with a proper gaming rig.
i just upgraded from a 8th gen i9 to a 14th gen i9 and 50 gigs of Sims mods has never loaded so fast
make sure he got those microcode updates for that 14700k
That back fan better be an intake and the THICC cooler better be an exhaust cause Im gonna lose a shi- on that thermal performance
i hope such kind of freind spawns into my life also
We all need a friend like her
You got extra parts for me I’m trying to learn how to build a setup myself
Crazy upgrade, I’m still stuck with an i7 7700 and an RX480 4gb but will be switching to am4 with a 2060 soon
Teaching like a pro!
You hooked it uppp, I KNOW he's hyped
Holy he’s lucky to have you as a friend because you gave him some series top end parts
wish i had friends that gives me pc..
The fact they built it on carpet tells me all I need to know, will never be seeing one of your vids again
completely unrelated but what breed is the white dog (not the corgi on the pc the irl one)
Nice I’m still on i5 2050 2gb ram and intel hd 3000 graphics I genuinely don’t know how i’m still working on it
Should have went amd and the h6 flow case
Wish I had a PC your friend is lucky
Only 1 thing is bothering me. Those cables a cross GPU from the AIO
My boy got an aio with a display just to face it at the wall. Im fucking dead.
Your spare parts are better than mine hard earned parts lol
Friends in parallel universe
All that to keep it unseen.
That mousepad has been there for all the sessions and she just put a smile on it
probably he will replace the desk pad.
10k likes and she gives me decent free pc 

(note - i don't have any pc trust me)
“Stick it in, shove it in” she’s definitely said that to someone before in a different context
you said you’re giving him the ugly parts but that mobo is the most beautiful i’ve ever seen
Oh my that cooler is THICC
I need friends like you guys
Don't diss the 1080 the 1080 ti was goated
I believe rapid trigger is basically the same as snap tap and it is not allowed in cs2. Correct me if I’m wrong though.
i need friends like this
i really need the upgrade
How does she just have all this leftover new parts?
I need an upgrade I'm on a 10yo laptop over here
Why i don't have friend like you
so that's how your friends get you to give them a new pc? By being absolutely physically disgusting and griefing your games?
so jealous i had been saving up for a better gpu but bottleneck too big for cpu so now i am saving to replace both
Great video but the 14700K has huge problems with the voltages killing the CPU, extremely common problem with this CPU. I would definitely would change it out if you still can but if its too late the bare minimum i would do is BIOs update the motherboard so the voltages arent set so high. So the CPU wont die within the year. I would be extremely concerned for this cpu
Where can i get friends like these?
Dude, you're so lucky, I want a friend like that too
I wonder wheny friends will get a pc too
gpu sag goes crazy
If only i had friends like you
Intel in 2025 is diabolical
What a blessing, I hope he said thanks tech baddie when you were done.
Damn what great friends he has
Bro I need me some friends like these dam
I can make a use of that old setup plz
True Friends
TENZZZZZ MOUUUSSEE BABYYYY
WOULD LOOK BETTER IF THE AIO IS IN THE SIDES
TURN THE PC AROUND EVEN IF THE IO IS AT THE FRONT THAT THING IS NOT GOING TO FACE THE WALL
Yea if you could just teach my brother cable management my pc looks crazy but ion wanna touch anything
Loving that cooler
Ngl imagine the goat of VCT coaches ain’t even have a good ahh pc what is this man
Probably not the brightest idea to give this man a white case considering how much he takes care of it
7900xtx has a lot of stuttering issues
Need a friend like that lol
poor john caugt the smoke that effect is never not funny. It was perfect
No it facing the wall
i went from my gpu being the 590 to the 4070
That cooler is chunky its so distracting to me. Good build thou
Shows us how he doesn't take care of his setup or clean it and then you give him new expensive stuff??? Crazy work in my opinion
How did he survive with that mouse pad my nose would kill me
It's a shame that beautiful build is sitting on that side of the desk so you can't even look at it
250 dollar cooler is crazy
I need a friend like you shiiiii
Why does he have tissues on his desk
I also wants friends like u
pretty nice build just needs more storage 1TB is a small drive
Can you please build me a setup I play on a 6 year old switch and I really need a upgrade please
I'm curious about why you went with intel for the CPU when AMD objectively has better value.
Thanks for not putting the pc on the floor.
wild to see chet here like (coming off valorant videos)
I'm sTiCkInG iT In
never thought i see chet in video building video
bro the 1080 is actually good
Here for tech reviews, also admiring the nails so pretty
Bro Why don't I have friends like you .
the cooler was THICC, just like........
Yo I thought you were Fuslie for a second.
And remember if just wanna play games just us a ryzen 7 7800X3D and even for multi tasking is really good
The ram is worth more than my pc build (budget baller)
HOW DO YOU HAVE A 14700K LYING AROUND?
You have got no exhaust fans flip the AIOs fans to exhaust
I want friend like you. Please make for me one
I jave the matcha green 270. Still buying all the stuff to go inside. Lol Gpu this on july 18th. 9070 xt 16 gb in white or silver

She is speaking my language
Bro where these friends at

God please give me a friend like her
I need friends like this they all got pc’s and left me on ps4 im hating my life trying to keep up.
UNC Chet from NRG?""

Wish I had friends like you lol my setup is so much more sad than his lol
At lest you punished him with intel
How do you have so much extra parts laying around ?
I use a Aio computer It used to be my father's, my father got it from his father and he has I3 5 gen 4 gb ddrl3 intel uhd and 720p screen

What the fuck is chet doing here, his a valorant international title winner coach whaaaaat, also bro that setup u just gifted is crazy, I wish I had someone gimme that
I need friends like that
Where’s my upgrade at
If he had a 1080 anything else will be a downgrade
woah a 1080 is nasty?! I got a 1660 Super bruuhhh
Damn, and I thought my setup was dirty for having a thin layer of dust, cat hair, and the odd crumbs
Talk about an upgrade holy shit
chet be just doing stuff nowadays
Can I have the same set up :D
Why buy such an expensive aio if you're not able to see it?
Are you trying to tell us you're on the market?
Chet Singh my goat
WAIT COACH CHET?!!
aye bro my name is chet as well, there is only enough room in this world for one of us
I have multiple computer fans that are 3 pins, but my motherboard only takes 4 pins. Is there an adapter we're you put multiple fan pins in
I don't think the white keyboard is a good idea tho
THE GPU sag is bad!, put a bracket in PLEASE
IS THIS CHET FROM VAL?

I wish I could have your help i am still using a 1060
Nice Pc u deserve sub from me, but just use nvme storage cuz they are faster
Bros a valorant coach but uses 1080, no wonder he hasn’t been winning for years
hey peachie we are friend right?
Can I have his old one
bro i'd love that for collage
tell him to give me his old pc and his old mousepas
imagine unironically being frriends with chet
Please be aware of the 14th gen Intel cpus, they are very unstable.
Can't even see the PC
That’s not what he needed.
Bro i even used i3 3220 it was a hp desktop later i had a i5 7400T then i had a i5 8400 then i had i9 9900KS i got a i9 9900KF too i'm pc collector so i have very old and newer parts
Please update bios as fast as you can 14th gen will fry itself
How much would you sell hes old setup for?
How can I be your friend?
You are scary
Do He Bath ? Daily Or In A Year ?

Why can't you just have the same GOOD quality for all your videos
Having doordash as an option is the most big back thing I've seen
I can't be the only one here just for the outro and not for the video itself
love the outro btw
THANK YOU FOR THE OUTRO
SHLEERP Is back again
I never thought a steam deck would be that useful.
THE OUTRO IS BACK
i use a remapped number pad - (i use HID macros for remapping and 3d print labelled button covers for it, works well)
2nd Worst take you ever did tbh button for door dash lol
“What’s wrong honey, you asked for a Stream Deck?”
Shleerp already comment four times
I use my stream deck mk. 2 for programming, and it also works as a digital photo frame when not in use
The cable is detachable. I’ve had the small one that only has like 12 buttons.
When a non removeable cord breaks, I replace it
Rare instance of Carter not glazing apple If only there was an Apple streamdeck
the fact that he randomly discovered something in this thing while making the vid is funny af ngl
Yo Carter, is that a button to a spicy site there? My guy has the gooner button on lock
""The whole thing was bricked""
My brother in christ........ solder.
WE GOT BACK OUR OUTRO!!!
So we all gonna act like we didn’t see that
As someone that has a macro pad (built with an arduino) you will always just use ctrl c and ctrl v instead of the gimmicky buttons
A steamseck for DOORDASH ️
Im gonna put a schleerp shortcut on my stramdeck
i love how nobody noticed ""pizzahub""
Just give us the thugtro carter...
Pizza Hub on the stream deck is something we can ALL relate to
You do NOT need a button for doordash ️
We gosh oh diddly want that thugtro ️
You never appreciate the outro enough until it's gone
WE WANT OUR INTRO NOW CARTER
Pizza hub
A streamdeck for doordash is CRAZY
You know what else you could put? A shortcut to make you do the thugshake.
SHLEERP CHILL
Love how the outro was the nostalgic kind
Shleerp will be put to rest hopefully
Shleerp wilding out
THANK YOU! FINALLY THE OUTRO IS BACK
can you set it for keybinds in games or make it press keys? it would be super useful for setting keybinds
bro got that Eyestream 2019 ahh intro
FIRE OUTRO
The outro
I have a loupdeck live s for music and discord controls
They use those at the Virtual Production Stage I worked at (they're all gamers so it now makes so muuuuch sense!)
Scream deck!
I xlicked rhinking that this was about the steam deck
Please add a thug shake button
Why you need copy and paste when you have Ctrl + C Ctrl + X Ctrl + V
A video about srtups and pcs? thats new
My point is the liquif glass is the best ui choice they have ever made
A door dash button is peak bigback technology
at this point its just ragebait
Dad got me a stream deck for my birthday without asking. W
I am running A Gtx 1060 3GB build cant even play gta or literally anything without it Lagging and I can't really get a new build because im in Germany and everything is a bit more expensive here and since i don't have money i cant get a new one
Instructions unclear, now I have a STEAM Deck
I almost cried when Shleerp said ""thugtro""

we need a button on the stream deck to show carter doing the thug shake
The outros back
That outro was very important. Thank you.
I use it mainly to mute and deafen on TS and Discord and also for my soundboard
Why the slop content
Elgato released virtual stream deck software any screen can now be a macro pad.
We both know we saw THAT Carter
Cool but can you put the thug shake on it?
Beautiful outro
Shleerp is NOT taking this summer off
I dont hate carter tho i want to make that clear
And they got VSD on 7.0 beta. Very huge W
that outro used to be my youtube channel intro in like 2018
Slheerp is so majestic
don’t think we didn’t see that shortcut “carter”
I always here “steam deck” instead of “stream deck”
Shleerp didnt notice Pizza Hub
For that people: "" where's button??!!!""
Liquid glass is soo underrated
Imma just use it as a soundboard dawg
wasn't gonna like until the outro came in
Never lost the outro, the last couple of videos have been re-uploaded
The stream deck keeping you big as hell
Now I’m just watching for the outros
We got the outta back it's so majestic
Windows ai button on a laptop 
Stream deck with an chatgpt button
U need the one with the knobs, it’s sm better
Banger outtro
Welcome back Shleerp
Bro acts like its alien technology
I think it’s easier to hit control + c and then control + v than to reach and press the stream deck buttons
The stream deck ist good but it’s really expensive
The last used emojis are freaky as hell
Can I have the dji mic 2s please day 413
OUTROOOO YEAH!!!
wait until he finds out what a bookmark is
I got the mini and it's a great media controller as well
Copy, paste, chatgpt, YouTube, visual studio, unity, git hub, undo, redo, zoom in,zoom out, change window, back to desktop, open file explorer (on windows), open browser
All that and I may still have more buttons to use ngl
Yesss stream deckkk review
Pizza Hub lol
I thought he meant Steam deck and I now spent 650 dollars on it.
Bro cant last a day without breaking a device
I need for school
outro button on the deck
Nice outro
Bro doesnt need to tell his opinions if they suck tho
Fuck it i might buy this when upgrading my laptop
That is the most Carter thing I've ever seen you do
So... A taskbar️
Must’ve been the wind
I need that only for food
Did no one see the pizza hut one
I’m begging for a Mr. who’s the boss Collab
The outro is stupid too lioe its there just to make people talk about it slop content
Dolrdash is easily carters weak point
I literally just use it as a taskbar
Pizza hub is crazy
Chat gpt cuz he cant do anu amoumt of research
Yo Carter, gotta do an outro that's just the invincible title card
Wait till he finds out abt keyboard shortcuts
Did no-one see the shleerp button?!
D
I heard you could turn a number pad into a stream deck
pizza hub got me
the fact that it says ""Pizza Hub"" and not ""Cornhub""
So real
WHY DO WE NEED A BUTTON FOR THE HUB
Shleerp chill ️
My dad works from home and has two in his setup. Half of his buttons are ip addresses
Why is nobody talking about the pornhub button
Okay thats actually really good
The sheer amount of laziness
And now it's a business expenses
Carter is such a big back having DoorDash
Carter putting his pc on the floor while it's sucking up all that delicious dust
respect to the guy who commented (multiple times) on his comments
Outros are backkkkk
Using that takes longer than just pressing ctrl c bro
There was PHub button in last row
Most expensive app buttons ever...
INTRO IS BACK
WHYS NOBODY TALKING BOUT THE PH ICON
Linux users:
Look what they need to mimic the fraction of our power
Just gonna quietly add ""Pizza Hub"" to my streamdeck and call it a day.
Yeah, just ignore the pizza button
The outrooooo
""iOS 26 gonna be crazy"" - carterpcs 2025
I cannot tell how much i despise carters opinions
Ok, I am buying one today
Shleerp commenters keeping Shleerp big as hell who is keeping you big as hell
Theyre so god damn expensive though.
you even got a pizza hub button, that's so cool
Why do you need a dedicated file explorer button when win+e exists as a shortcut
Macro deck is free and you only need your PC and phone to use it.
Are we all gonna ignore the pºrnhub button on the deck
the outro
The outro
Would you not place the bed on the left of the door and place a devider between them?
AW HELL NAH PIZZAHUB???
You can use your phone as a stream deck
People use it for flight sims
Sheerp is crashing out again…
Star Citizen or other games like that with a shit ton of keybinds
Bro doordash
I think shleerp is a little too obsessed with Carter
GIVE BRO HIS LAPTOP
Or just set up macros
You can literally do all of that. For free with your phone.
I got that same outro but i use it for an intro
Stream deck + is better. Has knobs and you can just slide infinite times to different scenes
WEE NEEED THEEE OUTROOO
Cater instead of useing crtl x and v
I always hear steam deck :sob:
you can just use numpad or win+e
yes
HOLY SHIT NO ONE SAW 
THE HUB 0:24
INTRO NOW CARTER I DEMAND IT
When is our king getting his pc
To copy and paste is the stupidest use of it just use your keyboard shortcut. It’s not that hard.
Keep the outrooooo!!!!
doesnt he already have a footrest thing for doordash
bro added an outro to make the vidoes a couple seconds longer
Didn’t u have a stream deck plus as well?? I have one it’s great
So nobody else noticed that?
there’s a button no ones talking about
I don’t know why but I want one cuz it’s techy
OUTROS BACCKK
THW OUTRO IS BACK!
If you actually understand something about tech you could change the cable
GIVE HIM LAPTOP
i thought he was saying steam deck for half the video
day 2 of asking carter to do the thug shake
AHHHHH WHICH YOUTUBERS OUTRO IS THIS!? I swore I watched his vids
Just buy a mini monitor that has a touch screen it cost $50
What is Shleerp on?!?!?

OUTRO JEHY
Stream deck + is sooooo good for me. Allows my ancient at2020 to sound crisp, and I can soundboard my friends. The soundboarding alone was worth the money
Bro is so lazy that he cant even open a site to order food
Why is no one talking about the PH button
Pizza hub
I saw that Carter.
File explorer!?!?! People who use WINDOWS + E
What button gives us the Carter thug shake
make a outro button
this is what i used the apple touchbar bor
Why?
So how customizable is this? Could I run midi signals through it? Could I use it to trigger effects in let's say ableton live?
SHLEERP CHILL
Carter you should make and sell your own keyboard, maybe do a collab
YESSSSS
its an intro outro
bro cant even tyoe shortcuts on a keyboard he needs seeprate buttons like a child
Under 1 min gang
bro discovered macros
Just assign a shortcut
Did I see the hub???
bro so lazy not only does he use chatgpt but he has a dedicated button to bring it up instead of just looking it up not only that but A DEDICATED DOORDASH BUTTON TOO
you can also get another keyboard
Buddy is too lazy to hit 3 buttons so instead he hits one to copy or paste

I read the reviews on amazon and they all have the same complaint that the side buttons are not that great and the mouse wheel is squishy.
Looks like half of a banshee in design

Got it

No one tried because they assumed others faster
I claimed it
WOW LOL NICE
Prime example of why xbox is bleeding money. Mfs giving away gamepass like they aint gotta eat the cost
Everything comes with games pass nowadays
Totally worth for the aesthetics. Not interested in the customer acquisition tactics for the game service of the publishing company active replacing game devs with ai. They can keep that part.

Looks great. Do you plan to review the Rawm mouse? I want to try the ultra-light design and optical switch.
Um youjust gave us free gamepass
Who wouldn't want that??
You gotta buy the keyboard. It’s the same theme same creator, but the keyboard.
recharge being under is a crime
2000's gaming vibe:
I would get the mouse and it’s matching keyboard by the way, just for the sake of novelty because I collect Xbox stuff
Already redeemed
hehe
i got it
You have to be care full about the ""gamepass"" some brand lie about it its happened to me before when i got a 3rd party controller
SSHUT UP WITH THE BOTS
Alright. Pretty nice. Now hand it over
The keyboard is so nice
He obviously used the code first ️
? why did you just show it and not review it
I’m not sure why they made the plastic green as if it’s already been aged several years
Wait so you can play competitive fps with this mouse and it won't be considered cheating like ximming? Right?
Im trying to use the code but it won't let me.
I got the keyboard and mouse they look really cool but they feel really cheap so I honestly wouldn't recommend unless you just want it for the aesthetic
Everything comes with game pass. I ordered a Monster Hunter x Digimon vpet collab. It came with gamepass. It's not even a device that works with PC/xbox
try out the kreo-tech swarm gaming keyboard - its amazing value for the price! (its better than the Auala F75)
why is youtube just now showing me this
im gonna need 8bitdo to start making pc cases to go with there other accessories
game pass sound test?
ЧЕРТ ПОБЕРИ, У МЕНЧ ТОЧНО БЫЛА ТАКАЯ МЫШЬ
я поям уверен в этом, но это было года так в 2010-2013
So you cant use it while its charging? Automatic 0/10
If its as good as my G-502 id get it.
Pls review aula f75
What is the mouse for? Fps?
what if i just redeem the pass and refund the mouse
Can you ever give your own opinion anymore like it’s so tiring not being able to find a YouTuber with their own thoughts instead u find buy this buy that and now you’ve even fallen in that category
Code don’t work
POV the person that actually get the game pass
I wouldn't be against it
Did he run out of keyboards
How long does it last the gamepass
oooohhhhhHhHh link in the description guys oOOooooHhhh
who got the code?
Who tf redeemed the game pass?
I want it, not for the GamePass put because I need a new mouse
It looks cheap and uncomfortable
I love the keyboard but I shouldn’t have gotten it
I'm an Xbox person, but even I have to say no
GaMe PaSs HuH?!?!
Yo can u review the geeky gk61 pls
8bitdo is a good company when it comes to controllers and other things!
Can it drag click?
I need game pass ultimate all of my games won’t work with regular game pass
I want this
8bit DO, not DOUGH
Finaly not a keyboard
I like my women like I like my keyboards

Ergonomic and thocky
why you showing us code
Respe... Nah screw it
I have only know how to play games on xbox
Me I would

Chips huh what kond you wanting to get

Great vid, man!!! May I ask where you got that wallpaper on your desktop? <3 Absolutely gorgeous!
Hi! How to turn Off that glowing in control panel? It's so annoying at night's, especially in bedroom
why did you put budget in your title this is high end expensive . putting budget in your title makes it seem like its going to be a budget desk
Since when is a $600 desk “budget friendly”?

You utilize the L-Shape desk to its fullest! Great dual setup, looking forward to the makeover vid.
We've been waiting for this for a while! That gaming setup is sick, I love the monitor.
The L Shape desk looks cool! Awesome new setup man!
Fire setup brother!!
Let’s go!!! Finally, something I can watch while I have my lunch today
devastated I can't get Vernal gear here in Australia! it all looks gorgeous.
Dope setup my guy!
I am also setting Myntrading office and set up. Great video
The mini fridge is a must for me lol
I would potentially wait on the Studio Display to see if Apple announces a new one at WWDC, or alternatively to see what other manufacturers come up with on the 5K alternatives this year. It's what I'm doing. My current monitor works just fine for me, I'll wait until at least 90Hz minimum comes en masse to 5K.
That monitor is ART
Nice video love it on my way my desktop setup this year
if you're into manifestation but feeling confused by all the different methods out there... this book Vibrations of Manifestation explains everything through actual quantum mechanics. started yesterday and already seeing things differently. the frequency method makes so much sense when you understand the science behind it. finally feel like I get how this actually works
Great video! Keep the awesome stuff coming
Starting my youtube channel soon, unfortunately, I'll need to steal your entire setup, this is impeccable! Don't worry, I'll use your affiliate links lol!
Never understood why any L-shaped standing desks have one side shorter than the other. Just make them with equal sides.
The Apple logo on your MacBook looks so real. Like so realistic
just a heads up, you already know this probably but don't leave your oled monitor on for aesthetic due to their burn in tendencies
I feel like you can get a better monitor than that. 5k resolution doesn't mean squat, and you have other options for webcam and speakers
Seeing a thermoelectric fridge hurts my soul. That thing probably uses as much electricity as your whole gaming rig.
Shoutout to Eddie!!
Looks amazing! What are the desk dimensions?
meditation teacher here. been studying manifestation for years but the way Vibrations of Manifestation explains it through quantum physics is completely different. it fills in all the gaps in traditional manifestation teaching. seeing my students get clarity they never had before. this book is genuinely helping people understand how reality creation actually works
What is the large rectangular light on your productivity setup?
What is the monitor riser and MacBook dock you are using? I like that they both go with the desk!
Bro, this is insane! Could you quickly calculate the total cost of all of them?
Link to wall slats?
How can I get that live wallpaper you’re using? Looks so cool
This one is for the algorythm
Would you mind linking that arcane wallpaper?
I wish the L shaped desk came in all black
So.................can we get a gallery of the space wallpapers, please???
What are the dimensions of the Vernal desk? Thanks so much!!
Do you happen to know the height of the lower compartments of the side cabinet when the drawers are not installed?
I'm wondering if I can place some ring binders in there which are usually 31.5cm tall.
Would you ever get a Mac mini?
what the mini frigde 
you have
What which size did you get? I'm looking to get the 80 by 72
hey where u get dat wallpaper from
coming from a science background I always thought manifestation was bs. but kept seeing people talk about this book Vibrations of Manifestation. decided to test the quantum field method with small things first. started noticing exactly what the book described - subtle shifts, increased clarity, opportunities I would've missed before. the scientific explanation finally bridges the gap between quantum physics and practical manifestation
looks good, i just dont understand how can someone game on a 16:9 in 2025.... specially when there are awesome oled ultrawide monitors out there......

i mean... if it was me, i'd change that old-school 16:9 granny monitor out immediately, 

otherwise everything else looks good.
Hope U didn't get that 5k monitor. And an iPhone camera is way better quality. Google how to configure it to be a webcam and the best stand to use for it
I wish i wasn't born in lower middle class with such desires...
razer products are sheit, own many all of them all fall apart after some time
ok weird request but can someone who's read Vibrations of Manifestation dm me? started the book last week and have questions about the quantum field chapter... like did anyone else notice their dreams getting super vivid after trying the frequency technique? or am I just trippin lol. need to compare notes because some wild synchronicities happening and none of my friends are into this stuff. first manifestation book that actually explains the science and I'm kinda shook at how it's working

So, whatthe hell is a com setup? Well, acompetitive setup is a gaming setupwhere they completely ditch aestheticsand focus on raw gaming performancewhile making it minimalist and cozy atthe same time while keeping the perfectbalance. And even though I have a crazy$30,000 gaming setup, I still findmyself playing games more on my brandnew comp setup. So let me know which onedo you like more and like and follow for","Comp setups are the way to go. I've made mine under 800 dollars. 24 inch 180hz monitor, Rapid trigger HE keyboard, PAW 3950 36g mouse (Scyrox V8), 500 x 500 control mousepad, and a mini PC with i7 and radeon graphics. I reached immo with this setup in Valorant
bro comp setups are so tuff mine is so amazing I’m so obsessed with it
i think the proper term is ""optimum tech style set-ups""
Didn’t know but I had a comp setup for almost a year now good thing it’s a trend btw you can add personality minimalistic way too like the mousepad wallpaper and more so great
Luv ur vids Aiden you inspire me big bro
bro can you create a detail video about your comp setup
that red setup at the beginning is so tuff
Comp because it’s for use and not just for looks
Bro getting multiple setups while i look at used dell optiplexes
Fr can u give me tips on a good comp setup I’m trying to make one to
Imagine, that you can have raw gaming performance and make it aesthetically pleasing at the same time?
ive legit been saying this for 2+ years bruh
sadly i had a comp setup before the trend and i hate it
But we all know rgb gives 10+ fps
On that second one with the all black setup does anybody know what monitor mount that is ?
I agree so much I’m hesitating so much on how to make my setup i’ll already be building my pc in 3 weeks right after my exams but i need help with layout idk what to do
Optimum was the main reason of some of this setups.
I have a mix of both, i have one of those aesthetic wood setups but i focused some of my peripheral on gaming like a 170hz monitor artisan zero and g pro superlight2 a mix of aesthetics and gaming with minimalistix design
Love that gravastar keyboard. I have the all white!
In the first comp setup does anyone know what the monitor stand is?
I prefer ur comp setup because its so much more cozy ngl and just simpler
In my opinion this is not a trend but they started popping of now a lot I had mine like a few years before till this day it is timeless
I need help for a monitor recommendations between 24-27 inches, at least 165hz and with good colors. And preferably under $200
Im too broke for any setup bro i have a 60 hz 2014 dell monitor
Sorry I’m not doing anything without to monitor unless I’m actually playing on a stage
I’m working a job to earn a 10000 dollar comp setup to throw everything in it
I was going to go with aesthetic but im got very good at Fortnite so I wanted to have a comp setup thank god I did I love it.
Need some advice I have a black desk should I just go full black with some rgb or like a white keyboard and mouse and have some contrast
Your dog is so cute!!!!!
Comp setups are way better than a over decorated setup (sry for my english)
If you can afford a comp setup you don’t need to play comp
I saw a crazy setup fkr 80 dollors
Comp setup are not I still cant afford It
I'm trying to build my dream setup
my setup
I have a comp setup for fortnite
Love the anime girl black red and white picture, anyone have a steam wallpaper engine of it?
Honestly comp setups are still really athesthetic
Someone copied your video, or you copied them just saying like word by word
Comp setups COOK 
I’ve had a crazy 20,000 dollar setup for years,but still I cannot win a penny back on cod because I focused too much on LIGHTS and not performance 
comp setups have already earned me 600 dollars back!
If it ain't RGB, it ain't for me... if you don't agree, ..

Hey gutsy I wanted to ask during the last stream I won the giveaway and I still haven’t received the mousepad so I was just asking if it was still coming

So,that's sort of what I'm doing today. I'malso going to be, you know, updating andupgrading this desk setup here. Um, notthe biggest thing ever, but I'm going todive into that. U, but fun fact, KTCsent me this monitor like 6 months ago,and I forgot to make a video about it.And I think today's um a better day thanany to sort of dive in mainly becauseI'm uh updating this desk setup here uphere in my bedroom. Now, this setupparticularly is a little bit different.Um I guess you could say it's a bit morespecial. Mainly because um compared to,you know, my basement setup that I spenda lot of time at, this place up here inmy bedroom is only meant for rest andrelaxation. Whereas in my basement, Ispend myself spending a lot of timethere. Yes, I do, you know, have thechance to game and relax and watch showsand all that. Um, but I find myselfworking a whole ton down there. Andsometimes I feel like I'm sort ofrotting or I'm getting stale. And uh,plus it's nice to get some naturalsunlight, which I do get up here in mybedroom. So, yeah, despite having, youknow, my dream setup down in thebasement, um, I feel a lot of pressureoften to work down there cuz that's theplace where I do my day job as anaccountant as well as all my YouTube,which, you know, it's more so a hobby,but sometimes I feel pressure to makevideos. So, up here, at least, this iswhere I'm going to get my full rest andrelaxation. Now, in this scenario, thismonitor at least is the KTC G27 P6S, Ithink it's called. I'm going to leave alittle note here if that's right orwrong, but um that's the model number.And pretty much this is a 1440p OLEDmonitor, um which is actually theupgraded version of what could be myfavorite 1440p monitor of all time. Ithink I used the previous model of thisspecific monitor um the most out of anymonitor I've ever reviewed or bought oranything. So, I'm pretty pumped to havethe upgraded version of it and I'll sortof talk about a bit of the differencesum with this one. But sadly, I don'thave the previous model because it didget water damaged. Um but that's why I'mpretty stoked to have the newer versionof it. Now, as for why this particularmonitor is um a little bit more specialat least is because it's just soincredibly versatile and I find itprobably one of the best options interms of affordability and the featureset you're actually getting. For me atleast, that's going to be things like,you know, watching shows, movies, mediain general. Um, as well as, of course,myself as a gamer, I'm going to betalking heavily about, you know, consolegaming. And recently, I got back into myPC gaming, which is a huge bonus forthis. And definitely while this setup isprimarily sort of my oasis away fromwhere I typically get all my accountingwork done, um I do actually love to workon YouTube. So there is a productivityaspect to this display, um especiallyediting, which I'll talk about. Andagain, while I'm a bit of a wannabeminimalist, um I say wannabe because I Iown way too much stuff, especially as atech channel, it's hard not to. But as awannabe minimalist, I really umappreciate minimal setups. And with thisdisplay, at least with the KVM andstuff, it does sort of allow me to havea more minimal setup without reallysacrificing all too much, which I'lltalk about. Now, for this display atleast, it is a 27inch size, which stillsort of remains my favorite display sizedue to, you know, the balance betweenresolution, um, clarity, as well as theactual footprint and size of the displayitself. Um, not only that, it's justhardware- wise, it's a lot easier to run1440p at 240 Hz. Now, in terms of all,you know, the ports and connectivity,like I mentioned, this is a veryversatile monitor, particularly in thissetup because, um, it has two HDMI 2.0ports. I'm only using one of them for myPlayStation 5. Um, it has a displayport, which goes to my PC, um, for my PCgaming. And then it does have a type-Cport, which is probably my favoritething about this monitor. I I'll sayit's probably tied for my favoritething. And that has 65 watt powerdelivery, which is awesome. Now, whatsort of ties my PC and whatever I haveplugged into that type-C together is thebuilt-in KVM, which pretty much allowsme to to um connect all my peripheralsor whatever else between those twodevices, and it just swaps between them,which is awesome. So, if you have, youknow, wireless dongles or whatever, uhyou can just connect that to the KVM andit goes between both the machines. Thereis also an audio jack here if you dowant to plug in, you know, like aheadset or a set of speakers orsomething. Um, definitely good to have.Particularly, I will say the built-inspeakers here are uh excellent. likemore than excellent and I'll talk aboutthat as well. Um, so I don'tparticularly have it. Again, I want tokeep my setup minimal, but the autojackis there if you need it. And fun factabout this monitor is that the panelitself is from LG, which is prettybadass. Um, this is the newer genversion of this of the panel. Again, Iwas talking about the previous versionof this model. The difference is thatthe newer one has MLA plus, which uhpretty much makes it get a lot brighter,which is awesome. I wasn't expectingthat. So, kudos KTC. Um definitely ahuge plus having a brighter display. Nowin terms of you know this setup as awhole and this monitor specifically is Ipretty much have everything I need inthis setup as you know minimal as it canbe. Um I recently got back into PCgaming like I mentioned and this thisthing over here is through the displayport of course and this is probably thesmallest um RTX 4070 PC I've ever found.Um that's an ASUS ROG Knuck which isflipping awesome. Pairs well at 1440pgaming. And of course I do have my goodold faithful PlayStation 5. Uh, I lovemy PS5. I love my console gaming. I'mone of those guys that loves both. So,um, that makes it into the setup. Ofcourse, for me at least, again, after along day, my favorite thing to do isgaming. It's always gaming. I do love towatch my shows and movies and all that,but gaming is usually my go-to if I havethe option to do it. It really is justone of those things that actually letsme slow down and relax. And of course,I'll talk more about gaming uh in amoment. Now, in terms of the type-Cport, I'm primarily going to be justusing this for my M4 MacBook Air, maybemy M4 iPad Pro. Um, not my work laptopwhatsoever. This this place is my nowork zone, which is awesome. Um, I don'tcount YouTube particularly as work. Um,despite the time that goes into videosand stuff, that's just one of my funhobbies that I love and I love creationwork. I love editing. I love makingvideos. So, my M4 MacBook Air will gothrough that type-C board. Um, likewise,again, that has connectivity to um theKVM switch, which right now I actuallyam powering this light bar on my monitorthat's going through the KVM port umjust because it draws power anyways. So,um, that works perfect as well as mygaming mouse. So, my gaming mouse goesthrough there. My keyboard specificallyis Bluetooth. I'm okay with that. Again,I'm not much, um, as a tryhard as Ipreviously was for, you know, usingdirect plugged or dongles and stuff forthe 2.4. I'm just going Bluetooth on mykeyboard and it works perfectly fine.Beyond that, during the night time, thisthis room gets insanely dark and thissetup is really dark. Um, apart fromthis light bar on top, I never use thebig light anywhere. Any any of theceiling lights I never use. Um, I preferto have a more relaxed sort of cozysetting, but this is still super dark. Ihave my portable lamps. You guys haveseen in a thousand videos. I love theseflipping lamps. I bring them with mealmost everywhere I'm reading or workingor whatever it is. Um, but I'm actuallygoing to get it. I got this new littlething. I got I got this light for like15 bucks. It's a GOI light. Um, it's thesame light strip that I use on mybasement desk setup, and it's actually aTV backlight, but it was like 12 or 15bucks or something. So, um, I like toput these around the edge of my desksbecause it helps illuminate against thewall and brings some light into thespace. And I can set it to whatevercolor I want, which is awesome. So,yeah, I'm going to go ahead and set thisup today. Um, as well as some[Music]gaming. But yeah, that's the setup. It'spretty basic. Um, somewhat minimalisticand I really dig it, especiallyeverything plugged into the monitoritself. Uh, honestly, it's just an easyway to have a nice dope lookingaesthetic setup. Plus, the Groveade deskshelf and the Wool Pad um do make a hugeaccent to this whole thing. So, Ireally, really dig it. Now, to actuallytalk a bit about um gaming. What thismonitor really particularly excels at, Ican say, is PC gaming. I actually tookum a pretty hefty break from PC gamingover the last, you know, three and ahalf, maybe four months after goingsuper hard into competitive Overwatch. Ihit the rank I wanted to hit and then Isort of burnt out and uh took a bit of abreak. I have been console gaming umparticularly during that time period. Umso it is most definitely refreshingcoming back to PC gaming. A because I'mgetting back into competitive games. I'mnot trying as hard as I was previously,but it is again nice to hop back intothose hero shooters I love. And b 240hertz. I've been uh playing at 120 Hzfor quite some time over the last bit.So it's a good bump in refresh ratewhich I really do appreciate. thatparticularly is going to be awesome whenit comes down to those hero shooters Imentioned. For me at least, I've alwayssort of just been drawn to uh heroshooters. I've been playing Overwatchsince its beta. And more recently, I'vegotten into uh you know, Marvel Rivalscuz that game is flipping awesome.Definitely a fun time. It's similar butdifferent enough that I'm still having agreat time with it. And uh it's a goodtime to play on PC. For me at least, I'mnot, you know, I don't expect myself tobe the top 500 player I once was or evengrand masters and stuff, but it is niceto hop back into PC gaming. For me atleast particularly, it's going to be,you know, the 0.03 millisecond responsetime on here that does make thecompetitive difference. Always somethingI appreciate when it comes to OLEDpanels. And they just look really good.In terms of the actual resolution, thisis 1440p like I mentioned before. Andhonestly, I find this to be the absoluteperfect balance um in terms ofmodern-day gaming. Not only does 1440pstill look incredible in terms of, youknow, fidelity, details, graphics, evenoutside of gaming, it's going to lookreally good, but it's also a lot easierto run on modern hardware, even olderhardware. You can get 1440p at 60 Hz,you can get 1440p at 120 Hz. Um, for me,again, my PC bounces anywhere between120 Hz to 240 Hz depending on the gameI'm playing. And 1440p sort of gives methat option depending on what I want tochoose. Now, since this is an OLED panelas well, and this sort of goes in handwith media as well, not just gaming, isthat OLED panels really do lookincredible. And honestly, it's reallyhard to match up to them. I've revieweda ton of different panel types from, youknow, fast IPS to VA to TN, all thesedifferent displays. They look good.They're not bad by any means, but whenyou compare that to, you know, the inkyblacks of OLED and the rich colors andthe infinite contrast ratios, it's hardnot to, you know, see the benefits of anOLED panel. Now, if you haven't heard ofan OLED panel, compared to somethinglike LCD, um LCDs, they will havedimming zones where those zones, if theywant to reach closer to black, they'lljust dim down, right? That's whatthey're called, dimming zones. Theproblem is th those zones are, you know,little blocks on the panel. Um they canonly go so dim. So, the blacks somewhatlook like dark grays. Um now, with OLEDpanels, uh the pixels individually turnon and off. So, when the pixel is off togive you black, it literally is black.Um, so that's why OLED panels look asincredible as they do. And not thatit's, you know, a huge comparison. I'lljust have a quick um photo or clip hereshowing my iPad. I guess I'll use myiPad, which is I think an LCD, whatever.Again, that isn't to say LCD is bad, butmy absolute preference comes down toOLED. Again, hopping from uh myPlayStation or my Xbox Series X back toPC for Marvel Rivals. A, I'm gettingabsolutely stomped on because I'm rustyas heck on PC. Uh, but man does it lookgood, especially at that 240 Hz. I loveRivals. It's an awesome game. So, if youhaven't tried it yet, definitely give ita try. But yeah, if I do want to slow itdown a bit, I recently did get back intoWorld of Warcraft for the first time inlike 5 or 6 years, and people warned menot to get back into it. Um, it's a fungame, but honestly, right now, as atired ass dad, I don't have a lot oftime in the first place, so I trulycan't commit to it like I once did aslike a top 100 North America raider andall that. I don't have time for that.Right now, I'm playing casually for thefirst time in my life. and it's a goodtime. So, if you want to try World ofWarcraft, give it a go or don't. It canbe addicting depending on who you are.Um, but yeah, for me right now, it'snice to play casually. But yeah, apartfrom World of Warcraft, I do love myDiablo I is always a good time. Um, aswell as games like Red Dead Redemption2. Absolutely incredible game. I love toplay those um to test out any monitorsI'm on, and that's always a good timefor those games. Now, of course, Iabsolutely love my PC gaming. And Idon't get it, but people seem to thinkI'm crazy that I love console gaming aswell as PC gaming. It's like it's acrime to love both for some magicreason. But again, I love my PlayStation5. Um, particularly I will say for somereason, I don't know what it is, but theHDR experience on console um alwayssweeps the floor with my PCs regardlessof what the spec on my PC is. Um, I'mnot sure if that's a Windows thing, um,a PC thing. Either way, I love the HDRperformance on here. Now, I'm not one toever particularly test my monitors. Idon't calibrate them. I don't measuretheir peak brightnesses and stuff. So,I'll leave a link in the description ifyou do want to check out somebody elsewho's smarter than I am and tested allthis stuff. Um, Display Ninja, I thinkit is. Um, they they check out all thepeak brightnesses of HDR and stuff, butif I'm not mistaken, the SDR brightnessuh is brighter on this one. Again, it'sabout 275 nits for SDR content. Butagain, where it shines for meparticularly, it's going to be the HDRgaming on console. I love it. Um, if I'mnot mistaken, the you know, 1% peakbrightness is 1300 nits, which isactually pretty flipping awesome. Andagain, that goes in hand with my umediting that I've had a chance to do onthis monitor. This entire video thatyou're watching right now was edited onthis monitor. Um and I absolutely loveit for that. Again, on my PlayStation 5at least, I love to play games like umCyberpunk to really flex the HDRcapacity on uh these systems as well asthe display. And it does look absolutelyflipping awesome. And for the most partright now, um I'm still gettingabsolutely dunked on in Elden Ring. Umbut it is a good time. Elden Ring iskept at 60 Hz. Um, and depending on thegame you are playing, it might be 60 Hzor 120 Hz. Okay, so I'm actually editingthis video right now and um, I'm notsure if the spec sheet online isincorrect, but it says HDMI 2.0, but Iwas playing my PS5 last night and bothVRR and ALM worked on my PS5, which istypically only available on HDMI 2.1.Um, so yeah, I think this has HDMI 2.1,um, which is definitely a welcomeupgrade over the last iteration of thismonitor. Still, I do find the consoleexperience awesome. And this is wherethe majority of my slower games arewhere I can sort of relax a little bitmore um if I don't feel like playing anysort of hero shooters or anything. Andagain, the speakers on this display areawesome, which are great for any sort ofconsole players. You just plug it in andaway you go. Now, to lean back into theimage aspect of this display again, umI've been spending a healthy amount oftime actually watching shows for oncethis year. Um again, finding a betterbalance between work and media andrelaxing and whatever the heck it is.Um, I've been watching shows on hereright now. My go-to is Invincible. I'mfinishing that up. Incredible show, bythe way. Thank you guys for thesuggestions on that. Um, I mentionedthat in my last video, and boy is thatshow wild. But yeah, it's not justanimated content. I find anime looksbest on OLEDs and stuff, but pretty muchanything I've thrown on here, um, looksgood. And I've been spending a goodamount of time watching shows instead ofjust working myself into oblivion. Butthe comment section has been popping offwith, uh, suggestions for media andgames and shows and books. Um, so, thankyou guys. I think the next thing I'mgoing to watch is either Arcane or SoloLeveling, one of those two. Um because Ijust discovered anime for the first timein like the last year, year and a halfor something like that. But beyond that,the speakers I mentioned, um it's a dual5 watt setup. I don't know if the specsheet's lying u because they soundbetter than dual 5 watt and I've hadlots of dual 5 watt speakers in monitorsbefore that sound awful. So, I don'tknow if it's because, you know, this hasa bit of a bulbous uh back end. I'm notsure if acoustically the speakers can dobetter. They don't sound like 5 watts. Idig them. They sound great. Um, again,it sort of allows me to have a moreminimal setup and not have externalspeakers. For me, they're excellent. Butif you want something more than that, ofcourse, you do always have the audiojack.[Music]But yeah, obviously these speakersaren't going to beat an external set ofuh speakers, but they do sound good. Um,if good is the middle point for audioquality, these are uh a good chunk pastthat. But yeah, beyond gaming and mediaand stuff, for the times that I do, youknow, want to do some productive work,particularly YouTube. Again, I don'tparticularly classify it as work, Ireally do enjoy it as one of my hobbies.Um, so the type-C port is definitelymeant for my MacBook Air. Um, and thisentire video was actually edited on thisdisplay uh through the type-C port. Ican definitely say during, you know, theediting phase, color grading and stufflooks awesome on an OLED panel. Andperformance overall is excellent. So, nocomplaints. I will say too, um, with thenewer LG panel, again, like I mentioned,this is a newer generation of the panel.So, a lot of people had complaints aboutthe first generation or whatevergeneration, the previous one, people hadcomplaints about text um with colorfringing. Uh, and I can say that'smostly just gone. I've never personallybeen sensitive to um fringing on text,but it is mostly gone here if that'ssomething that you're worried about. Butyeah, working on any sort of YouTuberstuff won't, you know, encroach into myrelaxing zone because that is relaxingfor me. I really do dig making YouTubevideos. Um, that's why I mentioned thatas a part of this setup. Now, I sort ofmentioned it before. As much as I lovemy basement setup, um I spend a lot oftime down in my basement. It's dark,there's no natural light, and um it'sagain it is my dream setup, uh butsometimes I feel pressured to work downthere. Uh which is why I have this sortof setup up here in my bedroom where Ican a get natural light and b sort ofescape from just being in the same placeall the time for myself at least. Justtrying to find a bit of a better worklife balance. Um when I sit herespecifically and again I'm very verygrateful to have a secondary spot tosort of sit at. In this spot, I can givemyself permission to actually be adegenerate and just watch more than just20 minutes of a show after the kids goto bed or actually just play World ofWarcraft for a couple hours, which is aa bit of a new thing for me to playgames more than 30 minutes or so. Butyeah, some of the things for a desksetup for me at least that are importantis the setup's got to look good. It'sgot to be functional and whatever I'mdoing's got to look damn good. Um, whichis in part by this monitor when it comesdown to media, gaming, or whatever else.Honestly, prior to 2025 at least, Ialways found myself just rushing to thenext thing, whether that's mydestination, finishing a task orproject, a YouTube video. I wouldsometimes rush those. I would only playhero shooters for the quick matches andstuff. So, finally actually allowingmyself to sort of do nothing has beenthe best absolute thing for myself thisyear. Um, if you haven't done nothing ina while, give it a try. But yeah, if youfind yourself similar to me in thatsituation where you're rushing to thenext everything, you're going to beokay, dude. just slow down and enjoyyourself as corny as that is. But yeah,but obviously you don't have to listento some random dude on the internet talkabout a gaming monitor and his desksetup. Uh but if you feel like you needto slow down, just slow down. You'll begood. Anyways, for me at least, thiswhole desk setup will be my designatedunproductive zone and I'm okay withthat. Plus, it looks awesome. And I willhave everything linked down below if youdo want to check out anything in mysetup. Um, of course, the monitor aswell. KTC, thank you for sending this tome 6 months ago. Sorry it took me thislong to make a video. Either way, I amgoing to enjoy this dopeass monitor.Play some more World of Warcraft. And ifany of you guys are WoW nerds, add meup. I'll have my battle tag in thecomment section. We can run somedungeons casually, of course. If any ofyou anime nerds out there have anysuggestions, leave them down below aswell. I would love to hear them. Iappreciate you guys watching till theend. Till next time. I don't want to letyou down.[Music]Yeah, I know we have fall","Thanks KTC for sending this out a while back! Perfect addition to the setup.

Consoles have really carved in their place for me as I get older. At the end of the day, I like to lay on the comfortable couch and consoles are such a better experience for that. Switching between media apps and games with only a controller is just so convenient
This channel makes me feel like I'm not alone on this. Ever since getting a pc in 2020 coming from being a console gamer my whole life I was molded into someone who would end up shitting on console just because pc gaming is a ""better experience"" when in reality I've come full circle to realizing I enjoy them both but still love my console gaming. Going for trophies, getting to play on a big TV in a more relaxed way I've started to care less about every game running and looking the absolute best and just enjoying games again not being so picky.
The unique things in your videos is the just relaxing way you narrate the whole thing and really appreciate the minimalist approach, kinda the back to home feeling I dream about too after a long day of work.... keep up the great work brother
Your voice and chill vibe to your videos is why I keep coming back. Thanks for what you do.
Another brilliant video, so much good info.
I don't know why I always assumed this room was a studio shed in your backyard. Probably the vintage door. 

In love with the aesthetic
idk if you have watched AOT yet but if not it is a must watch, you just have to get through the first 2 seasons. If you have then Solo is a great option!
Great view from the window buddy, well done for buying oled, sleeping cowboy in the barn
Solo leveling is a must watch. I watch Abit of Invincible and Arcane. Every Sunday, I was chasing the next episode of Solo leveling. Now waiting for Season 3.
I’ve done both console and PC all my life. Sometimes one more than the other. The 90’s were a mix of snes/ps1 and DOS. 2000’s were Xbox 360. Then PS4 and PC. Now more PC than PS5
i would watch Cowboy Bebop. Its worth your time!
Arcane is fantastic! Watching Solo Leveling now with the wife it it's pretty dang good too.
omg motorola razer 
Nice video, dude! Really down to earth one :) Will check this monitor, because that's exactly what I would like to do: PC/Console + Mac. Cables prerouted, just plug in and work and swap between devices! 
P.S. Fellow ow player :) the games and the shows you've mentioned are peak!
Kinda sad this brand isnt available locally to where I am at the moment. Great review btw~! keep it up~!
I also game on console and PC! I also have the first generation PS5 and last year I built my first gaming PC! My suggestion for anime show is definitely Attack on Titan!!! I think you would like it! It has a great story to it! I enjoy your videos, I’m hoping to finally get my channel up and running soon! Have a great day!!!
Probably mentioned in the comments but definitely watch arcane before solo leveling. I've watched both and they're both good but the story in arcane is just something else! Though by all means if you just want a good fun watch without crazy lore then yeah, Solo Leveling is peak.
Hey there, your vids are super chill and cozy love to see them come up on my feed, question how do you get that clock onto your iPad?
You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen Solo leveling. I think you will enjoy it.
PS5 for AAA and AA games and mini pc for indie games for me as 41 YO gamer. Still love pc gaming but don't want to deal with today's insane pc part prices anymore
I’m still waiting on my 5070Ti PC, but from what I’ve been playing on my 3050 6GB Laptop I don’t understand how I was able to sit on a controller for so long and tolerate the weirdness that is aiming in a competitive shooter style game. I’m switching to PC on shooter style games, and console for less aim reliant games.
what kind of chair are you using?
Do you still use the C4 as a monitor?
I saw your comment on spawnpoiint channel about LG 45 5K2K, I'm wondering if you're going to review that monitor?
Great video as always & a great monitor. Just ordered it with your link … I might have missed it but is it VESA compatible?
Hi , great content as always , super chill vibe . I wanna ask do you route rgb light strips only on the back of your desk or on the sides too ? I really want to try some Govee lights ,also do you buy extra diffusers for them ?
Are you going to be getting a review sample of the new LG 5k2k monitor? Really debating returning my LG 32inch 4k monitor for it.
Do you collect any older systems like PS2 or GameCube? Or do you think emulation is the way to go?
Hows thermals on your Asus Nuc for long playing sessions of 3-4 hrs ?
May i know your ipad mini standby time is which app?
Whats the game @7:48
Yo what’s the name of that anime girl background in the video?
video looks like a 720p video, =S no 4k
sorry i dont sub to channels that are fake gamers talk about gaming but nice setup man i only sub too lets plays channels like my self i am a lets play channel as well .
PLEASE GIVE ME VICTRIX PRO BFG I MORE THEN NEED THEN YOU

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Looks AMAZING DUDE !
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
I remember doing this for my room when I was getting my first gaming pc last year. I was suppose to only paint the corner of my room and then I ended up doing my whole room over and changing pretty much everything it was an amazing feeling when it came together.
I just revamped my room so this was pretty inspiring to add a couple more things in, loved it!
the pace of your storytelling is wonderful - not too slow to become boring but also not too fast to feel rush. I literally feel like Im actually living with you. You have a new subscriber here, thank you for making this vid
your video really motivates many people to re decor their rooms, as a full time college student and job, a side with streaming, i need to make my Room as Aesthetic as your room is now !
if i may give some more suggestions:
id recommend putting a curtain in front of your closet. it really blocks off the clutter plus i think a black curtain would look beautiful

i would personally also clean up the shelf above your setup a bit. there is a TON of stuff on it and the colors really clash agains the cozy vibe with your room. so if i were you id pick a few things i really like and put them on there, and the others somewhere else :D

overal, awesome video! i envy you!
The wood with the black was an AMAZING choice. I saw it before you even brought it up and went ""oooooooh thats gonna look good""
Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
That xenohunter knife is sick man (also your room)
this was a crazy transformation, you look MAD different since the last time we interacting and i'm glad to see you slowly killing the tech game. KEEP THIS SHIT UP
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
Im moving out soon and have been looking for room inspo. This gave me a clear idea of what I want my room to look like. Thanks a lot man
!!
Great video!!! stumbled upon it in my feed
Personally am a white/green with wood accents type of guy but I dig your overall update!
Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!
not gonna lie ... this turn out sick ... the way you turn this small room is so awesome... lot of love.
As many people are saying, the quality of this video and the editing are expected of a large channel! Keep at it, this was great!
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!
Love how dude just clipped his mic to his glasses
This video deserves a million views.
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
I’m so close to getting my dream setup I’ve been saving for a while now and have about 200$ I need way more but these type of videos inspire to keep saving up you’ve gained a new subscriber
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
don't remove the paper/seal on the PC with the PC on sometimes if its sealed to much it will cause static and maybe mess up ur pc for a bit but DW its ez to fix
man you deserve more subs, more views, more everything. You're a great youtuber and the fact you spent this much with only a small amount of subs has gotten you my respect.
How do you only have 11k man!?! Love the video and the whole design you went with, it's phenomenal! I eventually want to revamp my entire room and try and stream and make videos again!
first time watching you, and i have never ever stayed seated at my setup for that long just for a youtube video, keep it up man (great job with the editing)
Honestly, there isn't a lot of people make setup videos anymore and this was nice to see. Really great video and I'm definitely hitting that subscribe button. Keep up the great work!!! Sick setup!
this is amazing. You really did achieve a dream setup
Great Video! Loved the aesthetic. One small suggestion to get a black curtain to hide your closet + also keep dust and sunlight off your clothes.
I didn't expect this kind of quality from a channel with only 11k subs, great job bro keep it up!!
love the style you went for, amazing setup bro!
Loving the nice clean aesthetic of the room, and also the high end quality of the video itself. Seriously deserving of more attention. Keep up the great work man, you're doing an incredible job.
I'm yapping too much (12:30) is the most accurate statement ever!!
That wall with the black paint, the lights and the plant instantly improved the room, proper class! (Just needs to be not hidden by the bed! ) 2 mattresses though! I did that years ago and found it made my back worse! One of them was a cheapo one though, also do you notice much light coming through the canisteo window blinds? Look like they aren't flush to the sides if that makes sense?

Great set up BTW, room looks so much better after changing the decor!
It's always a treat finding Habesha YouTubers. Love ur vids gang
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
0:19 Not trying to be offensive or disrespectful, but low-key reminded me of Cookie from, ""Ned's Declassified. Which is an awesome character that brings charm to the group, which is my favorite when waiting for each episode.
room turned out dope!
love it dude! Im on my room revamping journey now as well. This helps a lot!
Boy 10/10 room bro you nailed it
this style IS the new ""rgb"" style
You just got another sub bro! Love the raw and genuine content.
setup looks crazyyy
I’m new to the channel and I can already tell you got potential. It was such a chill video I genuinely enjoyed it. And the end product Keep up the good work

I love your videos and it gives more ideas to my set up because I’m getting a new set up on my birthday
It actually does but you have to stream from your phone or ps5 and MacBook I think. Just saw a video explaining how. Hope that helps. You’re just doing it wrong
That notification pops up to let you know that the performance is not the best then you click continue and Fortnite will load
Use it dose it is with Xbox cloud gaming

I cover Tech, Desk Setups, Gaming Gear, and am a HUGE fellow nerd as well. Thank you for visiting my channel and I hope I can earn your subscription!",hmm camera's crooked what if I justthis video is sponsored by vernalearlier this yearI had to say goodbye to my desk setup of 4 yearsit was really really toughbecause I invested so much time and money into itand having to tear it all downit was kind of depressingthankfully I have a new and improved desksetup that I want to share with you guysthis is David your casual nerdlet's go ahead and check it outsince I knew I was starting from scratchI really wanted to extend my desk spacein the previous setup I already had a 72 inch deskthat was already plenty of real estatebut I was aiming for something different this yearthat's where vernal came in clutch and sent me overtheir walnut L shaped deskset up time was about an hour and a halfand that was just metaking my time to make sure everythingwas set up correctly got it oh yeahI opted for the integrated drawerthat just installs into the deskwith a few screw holeseverything's already pre drilled for the installationI also opted for wheelsbecause I am not trying to break my backone of my biggest concerns with the deskwas the weight capacitydue to the desk having three motorsit has a weight capacity of 350 poundsgetting the desk to wobble in any kind of major way wasreally difficult it was mainly the monitors movingI feel pretty safe about thisnot to mention there's an anti collision systemsafe to say that it workedand I did test it a couple times for safe measurethe height adjustable range is 26 inchesup to 49.6 inches and we have three memory key slotsperfect for a low medium and high settingand I also likewhen you're raising or lowering the deskit starts off slow and then gains speedabout 1.5 inches per secondthe desk is perfectand it's exactly what I was looking forsomething to split up my two setupsgaming and productivityI also added the vernal file cabinetand the side cabinetit was about time that I got rid of my Alex drawerthat thing was starting to look a little suspectI got the tall version of the file cabinetit came with the lockable castersand it even includes a key lockfor added security and peace of mindon the bottom drawer nowthe side cabinet was a lot shorterso it could actually fit under the deskinstead of doing that thoughI put this really cool mini fridge on topjust to keep a couple of drinks on the standbyand the side cabinet also does feature that lockingdrawer both of the cabinets come in the samematching color as the deskthis makes me really happybecause I don't have to worryabout mismatching colorsthe desk selection was super important this yearand I'm so glad that I found the vernal deskI understand this video is sponsored by thembut I am genuinely in love with this productit's not changing anytime soonprices start at $389and you guys can use the exclusive codeytst to get an extra 6% off your orderin my previous setupI had a really hard time separating the gamingfrom the productivitysince everything was on one monitorit was just way too easy to switch over to gamingwhen I really should have been editingor doing something more productiveand when I knew I had to moveI for sure wanted to get an L shaped deskbecause I had this vision planned for a long timeso let me show you guys my solutionthe hardest choice of the gaming setup was the monitorI knew I wanted to go oledbut do I go with the W OLED with a matte screenthe Cutie o lid with a glossy onehow many frames 14 forty p resolution or do I go 4Kmy answer came when I attended CES 2025just seeing everybody's oled offeringsmy answer was the Asus PG thirty two ucdmit's a 4K 240 hertz 2D OLEDand I also got the matching monitor armthe reason why I did go with this monitoris because of those crazy looking colorsin the W OLED and its matte screenyou lose a lot of that contrastthat OLED brings to the gamewith the QD OLED you gain the glossy screenso there isn't any kind of grainy filter over itbut it is Reflection Cityso if you decide to go with something like thisjust be aware of that nextI want to talk about the new speakersfor the gaming setupsince the monitor doesn't have any in built speakersthese are the Edifier Q65 speakerswhy did I choose these it's really simple you guysthey just look incrediblethe speakers have a 32 millimeter driver for trebleand a 70 millimeter driver for the mid and lowall of your controls are on the right sidevolume power and lighting controlsit also has Gant charger capabilitiesthis comes in handywhenever you need to charge anythingat a decent speed the sound quality is really goodthese aren't studio monitorsand they're not meant to be studio monitorsthey're desktop speakers with high quality soundand they're just fun to useI will say they do lack in the lowsso adding a sub onto this would be a perfect matchthe times where I don't wanna use the speakersand I wanna use the mic to chat with my partythe headset I've been using is the RazerBarracuda X Chromait's a really solid headset with 40 millimeter drivers50 hours of battery life a prettydecent mic for the price hellohello testing 12 3this is the Razer Barracuda X Chroma mictest testing 1 23 testing 12 3 and of course Razer Chroma Lightingit's perfect for playing any kind of single player gameand really good for playing multiplayer gameslike Marvel Rivalsnext let's talk about the keyboardthe one I've been using for a while is the Gravistar K1Pro if you were to make cyberpunk into a keyboardthis would be itwe have these claw risers that adjust the heightthis volume rocker that can also mute audiokale switches with 45 grams to activatean eight thousand million power batteryif you want to use this with Bluetoothor with the receiveralso the build of this keyboard is really solidI found it to be pretty lightbut also heavy at the same timeand so many other features that I just can't get intoin this videothe mouse that I'm using is the Razer Viper MiniSpecial Editionreally the best mouse that Razer has ever madeAK polling super lightand just an overall beast of a mousewhenever you're gamingif they could take this design into the regular Viperwithout adding too much weightI think it would be the perfect mouseand as for the accessoriesI have the Razer USB 4 docklet's add some frontIo for easy access whenever I need to plug ina mouse or charge my keyboardit gives me plenty of portsand the USB 4 speeds are top notchand my last accessory is the Devoom TimescapeI've seen these on Instagram on so many pagesand I see why because of the added utilityyou can customize this in their appand you have a super wide selection of optionsmy favorite is the YouTube subscriber counterand alsothis utility that monitors your usage for your GPUand CPU timeskateis a really cool accessorythat I didn't expect to have on my deskbut I'm glad it's there last but not least is my PCthe case is the H9 Elite from NZXTit perfectly displays all of my PC partsthe motherboard is an Asus ROG Strix X5 70a Ryzen 50900 x 32 gigs of RAM and a 30 80 Ti Founders Editionthe PC really does serve me welleven though it's a couple of generations oldI do wanna upgrade this yearbut the scalper prices of everything is justit's really depressingand that's the gaming setup for this yearhonestly it's the most exciting part of my setupbut equally as important is my productivity setupso with this oneI basically took my old setup from my old apartmentand recreated it hereeverything is almost exactly the same monitorwhich is the LG 38WN95C it's an ultra wide monitorwith a ton of real estate for editingand it runs at 144 hertzNext is the brains of the operationand that's my M1 Max 16 inch MacBook Proeverything is fully maxed out minus the SSD drivesstill an amazing laptop and no signs of slowing downthe keyboard I'm using is the key K3 Prowhy I chose thisis because it has every single functionI would need for the Mac the dialthe customizable macro padsand the Mac optimized shortcutsI also spent about four hours customizingand lubing the switches so it's butterysmooth and sounds amazinglastlythe mouse that I'm using is a Logitech G5 0 2 x pluswhy I still continue to choose this mouseis the feeland the ergonomics are close to the MX Master 3but it has theresponsiveness and the connectivity of a gaming mouseand the solution for the MX Master 3scroll wheel is the Magic Trackpadwith these two paired together with the keyboardI have full customizability of this MacBookCaldigit TS four helps with connectivityreally makes this whole setup workThe Scarlet Solo helps my Road MT one mic connectand my Bayer Dynamic DT 770 Pro X's help me monitor all of my audiowhen I wasdeciding how to lay out the productivity setupI just realized that I had it perfectand even better now that my gaming setup is behind meI no longer get distractedwhenever I'm doing my productivitytasks so that's really it for the desk setupstwo super optimizedplaces where I can do gaming and productivityat its maximum level and againmake sure to use the code y t s t to get that extra sixsend off your order the last but not leastimportant addition to this is the lightingsince I now have dark colored wallslighting is really hard to come byand what I mean by that isthat light is not bouncingall across this room anymoreso the lighting options in this room are even moreimportantthe first way I improved it was adding smart blindsto the studiothese are the dual roller shades from Gray Windthese motorized beauties can becontrolled right from your phoneor through voice commandswith an Alexa or Google Homethese specific ones are controlled through matterand it implements with Apple Home Kit perfectlythey're super quietrun on rechargeable batteries that last monthsand the installation is surprisingly simpleplus they come in different sizes and stylesto match any kind of decorI opted for the dual mortar shadesthe bottom layer lets the light inwhile the top layer is a blackoutperfectfor those days where I need to control the lightingand for the late night sessionsthat's where my Phillips Hue lights come insay what you want about the hue lightsthey are expensive but in my opinion and in myown usage they have the most stable connectionout of any other smart lights out therealso with the ecosystem of the lights that they havethey'll have everything that you'll needbecause of the Hue Bridgethe connectivityand the responsiveness is just the bestand not to mention the home kitconnectivity with your phone is just top tieranother lighting system that I like to use is Nano Leaffor the gaming setupI have these nano leaf black trianglessplash of color that this adds onto the setupreally makes it stand outthese lights also work from home kitsso it makes them really easy to usethe quality of the lightsand just the overall looksis what keeps me coming back to Nano Leaf lightsthese are gonna be some changesand some future plans that I do haveso the biggest contention with this setupthe walls make everything really really darknow I did plan for thisand I introduced a whole bunch of new lightingthat's different from the previous setupbut I didn't expect for the walls to absorbso much of my light soI do have some plans to add some more lightingaround the studioit's just gonna help accent the room even moreand I am a sucker for that soft lightingso aside from the lightingthere's another thing I do want to changeand it is that monitor back there on the productivitysetup I do have an ultra wide monitor 38 inchesbut I do have my eyes on that studio displayeveryone I've talked toin the space of content creationhas had glowing reviews nowI do knowI'm gonna be giving up a lot of screen real estatebut that monitor is packing 5K resolution60 hertz so I don't know how I feel about thatamazing speakersand a webcam that I can use for meetingsin my opinionit just looks to be one of the best monitorsfor a content creatorso let me know down in the comments belowif you think I should make that changeand the last additionthat I'm thinking about is adding a pegboardonto the empty space on that wall over thereI already have a couple of pegboards along the wayso that's gonna be solved really soonso aside from those minor gripeshonestly you guys I just I'm in love with this placeI've been extremely productiveever since I built it outin the previous place it was a rented apartmentso I wasn't able to do muchhere I'm able to hang whatever I wantdo whatever I wantand that's just you can't put a price on that freedomI'm gonnabe releasing a studio vlog video in the futureand that's just gonna show how I turned a really dustyold bedroom into my dream studioso you're gonna wanna subscribe andstay tuned for that so watch this next videoif you're interested in my last studio touror watch this video for Desk Setup 2024thank you for watching you guysthis is David serving you a little side of techand I'll see you in the next video God bless you guys,"Leave me a suggestion on links you guys! I know I have a ton of products in this video so I might've missed some
You utilize the L-Shape desk to its fullest! Great dual setup, looking forward to the makeover vid.
We've been waiting for this for a while! That gaming setup is sick, I love the monitor.
The L Shape desk looks cool! Awesome new setup man!
Fire setup brother!!
Let’s go!!! Finally, something I can watch while I have my lunch today
devastated I can't get Vernal gear here in Australia! it all looks gorgeous.
Dope setup my guy!
I am also setting Myntrading office and set up. Great video
The mini fridge is a must for me lol
I would potentially wait on the Studio Display to see if Apple announces a new one at WWDC, or alternatively to see what other manufacturers come up with on the 5K alternatives this year. It's what I'm doing. My current monitor works just fine for me, I'll wait until at least 90Hz minimum comes en masse to 5K.
That monitor is ART
Nice video love it on my way my desktop setup this year
if you're into manifestation but feeling confused by all the different methods out there... this book Vibrations of Manifestation explains everything through actual quantum mechanics. started yesterday and already seeing things differently. the frequency method makes so much sense when you understand the science behind it. finally feel like I get how this actually works
Great video! Keep the awesome stuff coming
Starting my youtube channel soon, unfortunately, I'll need to steal your entire setup, this is impeccable! Don't worry, I'll use your affiliate links lol!
Never understood why any L-shaped standing desks have one side shorter than the other. Just make them with equal sides.
The Apple logo on your MacBook looks so real. Like so realistic
just a heads up, you already know this probably but don't leave your oled monitor on for aesthetic due to their burn in tendencies
I feel like you can get a better monitor than that. 5k resolution doesn't mean squat, and you have other options for webcam and speakers
Seeing a thermoelectric fridge hurts my soul. That thing probably uses as much electricity as your whole gaming rig.
Shoutout to Eddie!!
Looks amazing! What are the desk dimensions?
meditation teacher here. been studying manifestation for years but the way Vibrations of Manifestation explains it through quantum physics is completely different. it fills in all the gaps in traditional manifestation teaching. seeing my students get clarity they never had before. this book is genuinely helping people understand how reality creation actually works
What is the large rectangular light on your productivity setup?
What is the monitor riser and MacBook dock you are using? I like that they both go with the desk!
Bro, this is insane! Could you quickly calculate the total cost of all of them?
Link to wall slats?
How can I get that live wallpaper you’re using? Looks so cool
This one is for the algorythm
Would you mind linking that arcane wallpaper?
I wish the L shaped desk came in all black
So.................can we get a gallery of the space wallpapers, please???
What are the dimensions of the Vernal desk? Thanks so much!!
Do you happen to know the height of the lower compartments of the side cabinet when the drawers are not installed?
I'm wondering if I can place some ring binders in there which are usually 31.5cm tall.
Would you ever get a Mac mini?
what the mini frigde 
you have
What which size did you get? I'm looking to get the 80 by 72
hey where u get dat wallpaper from
coming from a science background I always thought manifestation was bs. but kept seeing people talk about this book Vibrations of Manifestation. decided to test the quantum field method with small things first. started noticing exactly what the book described - subtle shifts, increased clarity, opportunities I would've missed before. the scientific explanation finally bridges the gap between quantum physics and practical manifestation
looks good, i just dont understand how can someone game on a 16:9 in 2025.... specially when there are awesome oled ultrawide monitors out there......

i mean... if it was me, i'd change that old-school 16:9 granny monitor out immediately, 

otherwise everything else looks good.
Hope U didn't get that 5k monitor. And an iPhone camera is way better quality. Google how to configure it to be a webcam and the best stand to use for it
I wish i wasn't born in lower middle class with such desires...
razer products are sheit, own many all of them all fall apart after some time
ok weird request but can someone who's read Vibrations of Manifestation dm me? started the book last week and have questions about the quantum field chapter... like did anyone else notice their dreams getting super vivid after trying the frequency technique? or am I just trippin lol. need to compare notes because some wild synchronicities happening and none of my friends are into this stuff. first manifestation book that actually explains the science and I'm kinda shook at how it's working

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LGJ9T7oBos,shorts,@Fluxphy,$350 Gaming PC vs Xbox Series S FPS test 😳 #shorts #gamingsetup #gamingpc #xbox #xboxseriess,61146,2025/4/14 0:00,0,79,0m41s,#shorts #gamingsetup #gamingpc #xbox #xboxseriess,0,""",",UCMzr9YZgGmv7Lht-t367PcQ,@Fluxphy,,30900,5405364,298,2014/2/1 0:00,📩 fluxphybusiness@gmail.com\n\n,"the Xbox Series S versus a $350 gamingPC in game. On the Xbox Series S, itheld a steady 120 fps in Creative, butit is pretty upscaled. When I switchedto 60 FPS, you can see the graphicsactually look like a true high ultrasettings. And then switching back to120, you can see that it doesn't lookbad, but it's just truly not a true highsettings. On the $350 gaming PC, it hitaround 240 FPS in creative and hoveredbetween 100 to 150 FPS in game. It didstutter a bit though, so I had to dropit down to 720p just to make the gameplay so much smoother. If you play onkeyboard and mouse, the PC definitelyfeels better, even if it has a fewstutters. But let me know down in thecomments which one you guys wouldactually","Bros is biased towards pc
You'd get more price to performance if you didn't get the ""White components"" tax

White PC parts are on average 5-10% more expensive
720p lol dang
keep in mind boys that pc is playing fortnite on way lower settings with performance mode on, so the pc got a pretty unfair advantage against the console
Well, it doesn't use upscaling on 1080p 120fps. And neither on 1440p 60fps since upscaling is not available in every game and is not needed. In some games like Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, it does use upscaling from 1080p 60fps with custom ray tracing.
The pc Will perform better if it was all black build
So, here’s the thing, I got my Xbox used with two controllers for 185, so in THAT price range Xbox is better, but $350, build a pc
Personally I think that Xbox is better as in reality it is selling better components for a very much better value per pound
Honestly, you should try getting a higher price range for a custom pc. Some oc brands have a high or overpriced pc for bad preformance but you can just ask somebody for help on good specs for a custom pc. In the end, the xbox is better.
Bro why did you buy a prebuilt if it’s 350 bucks you NEED to build custom and never go white unless you got like 750$ + not worth horrible outcome because of YOU!
I got a series s for 190 so it’s better than a budget pc and I just got it until I’m able to save for a pc
Dude this is @Vermax video
Do you know why it is stuttering? VRAM, yes— that’s right. With such a budget graphics card you’re not getting a lot of VRAM and therefore it can really take some hits in FPS’ like Fortnite. In this scenario where you don’t have a lot of money to spend, you should always go for the console, but if you really want a PC. I’d say spend a minimum of 500$ and if that’s not good enough do 1000$ and if that’s not good enough again and you want something high-tier, do 1500$ MAX.
Xbox imo is more versatile and just has a wider variety of options and overall preferences.
Xbox is meant to be more affordable, and games that you can play on Xbox are tested to see if the Xbox can even handle it. Getting a $350 PC is a waste of money. If you spend $1000 on PC you can play almost every game that has ever come out (ever) at 60+ fps. PC is also upgradable and way more compatible with games and controllers. Not to mention over clocking and other optimization techniques. Also PCs generally have more storage.

Bottom line: if u just want to game on a few specific games, and you don't want to bust the bank, go with Xbox.

If you want a more powerful and overall compatibility with any game you could ever want, go with PC.
Can someone help my game wall breaks when i enable lumen , i use rx6600xt i really wnt to play on high graphics, i dont care for fps
No comments let. Me fix that
Can that thang play dayz ? The pc not the Xbox .. I like that price point
What pc is it?
Bro 720p im not in 2010
Xbox because cheaper better fps
Xbox.The delay for kbm isnt that bad.And i want stable framerate .120 fps is kore than enough for me since i used to play fn on 25 fps on 800x600
Yeah , build if yourself, use used parts, dont use white parts, and you can prob get a high performance pc
Lemme share you a 450 dollar pc build for 1080p
Ryzen 5 3600 from aliexpress 65$
Thermalright assasin x se 17$
Asrock b450m-hdv 70$
Silicon power 16gb -25$
Crucial p3 plus 500gb for 40$
Used rx 6600 from ebay (look for one thsts 140-170$)
Montech air 903 base - 65$
Msi 650bn ps- 50$
Total: 470-500
I mean, if uve already decided that u want a gaming pc, y spend so less, just save up some money. Or else, get a console
W VIDEOO
Console for now pc become awesome over 700$
What’s the PC name?
i would pick the pc bc on xbox you cant stream that good and stuff and im trying to get a big streamer and you can play other things on the pc
Pc 100%
Xbox not much competition
Console used to be better for performance but those days are long gone. Just compare the GPU size to the console. Better off comparing a laptop to the console now
Yo wsg
Fluxhphy Give me one of ur pc's (atcually tho) my ps4 doesn't cut it
Ps

You utilize the L-Shape desk to its fullest! Great dual setup, looking forward to the makeover vid.
We've been waiting for this for a while! That gaming setup is sick, I love the monitor.
The L Shape desk looks cool! Awesome new setup man!
Fire setup brother!!
Let’s go!!! Finally, something I can watch while I have my lunch today
devastated I can't get Vernal gear here in Australia! it all looks gorgeous.
Dope setup my guy!
I am also setting Myntrading office and set up. Great video
The mini fridge is a must for me lol
I would potentially wait on the Studio Display to see if Apple announces a new one at WWDC, or alternatively to see what other manufacturers come up with on the 5K alternatives this year. It's what I'm doing. My current monitor works just fine for me, I'll wait until at least 90Hz minimum comes en masse to 5K.
That monitor is ART
Nice video love it on my way my desktop setup this year
if you're into manifestation but feeling confused by all the different methods out there... this book Vibrations of Manifestation explains everything through actual quantum mechanics. started yesterday and already seeing things differently. the frequency method makes so much sense when you understand the science behind it. finally feel like I get how this actually works
Great video! Keep the awesome stuff coming
Starting my youtube channel soon, unfortunately, I'll need to steal your entire setup, this is impeccable! Don't worry, I'll use your affiliate links lol!
Never understood why any L-shaped standing desks have one side shorter than the other. Just make them with equal sides.
The Apple logo on your MacBook looks so real. Like so realistic
just a heads up, you already know this probably but don't leave your oled monitor on for aesthetic due to their burn in tendencies
I feel like you can get a better monitor than that. 5k resolution doesn't mean squat, and you have other options for webcam and speakers
Seeing a thermoelectric fridge hurts my soul. That thing probably uses as much electricity as your whole gaming rig.
Shoutout to Eddie!!
Looks amazing! What are the desk dimensions?
meditation teacher here. been studying manifestation for years but the way Vibrations of Manifestation explains it through quantum physics is completely different. it fills in all the gaps in traditional manifestation teaching. seeing my students get clarity they never had before. this book is genuinely helping people understand how reality creation actually works
What is the large rectangular light on your productivity setup?
What is the monitor riser and MacBook dock you are using? I like that they both go with the desk!
Bro, this is insane! Could you quickly calculate the total cost of all of them?
Link to wall slats?
How can I get that live wallpaper you’re using? Looks so cool
This one is for the algorythm
Would you mind linking that arcane wallpaper?
I wish the L shaped desk came in all black
So.................can we get a gallery of the space wallpapers, please???
What are the dimensions of the Vernal desk? Thanks so much!!
Do you happen to know the height of the lower compartments of the side cabinet when the drawers are not installed?
I'm wondering if I can place some ring binders in there which are usually 31.5cm tall.
Would you ever get a Mac mini?
what the mini frigde 
you have
What which size did you get? I'm looking to get the 80 by 72
hey where u get dat wallpaper from
coming from a science background I always thought manifestation was bs. but kept seeing people talk about this book Vibrations of Manifestation. decided to test the quantum field method with small things first. started noticing exactly what the book described - subtle shifts, increased clarity, opportunities I would've missed before. the scientific explanation finally bridges the gap between quantum physics and practical manifestation
looks good, i just dont understand how can someone game on a 16:9 in 2025.... specially when there are awesome oled ultrawide monitors out there......

i mean... if it was me, i'd change that old-school 16:9 granny monitor out immediately, 

otherwise everything else looks good.
Hope U didn't get that 5k monitor. And an iPhone camera is way better quality. Google how to configure it to be a webcam and the best stand to use for it
I wish i wasn't born in lower middle class with such desires...
razer products are sheit, own many all of them all fall apart after some time
ok weird request but can someone who's read Vibrations of Manifestation dm me? started the book last week and have questions about the quantum field chapter... like did anyone else notice their dreams getting super vivid after trying the frequency technique? or am I just trippin lol. need to compare notes because some wild synchronicities happening and none of my friends are into this stuff. first manifestation book that actually explains the science and I'm kinda shook at how it's working

So, basically ahome theater setup. When I moved intothis house about a few months ago, Idecided to carve out a section of thebasement and make that curiosity areality. Now, the goal was reallysimple. It was to optimize the space forthe best possible media experience. Thatmeant adding soundproofing, installingbuilt-in surround sound, creating anultra comfy seating area, and setting upa top tier 4K projector with a versatilemedia setup to match.What is going on, YouTube? So, this isgoing to be my future home theatersetup, um, which I've cut out as a partof my home studio in my basement. So, ifyou haven't seen that video, you can goahead and check it out. Before I goahead and begin adding things to thisspace, I'm going to quickly give youguys a recap of um, everything that'salready in here and how uh, it's all setup. So, first off, this room measuresabout 123 square ft, which is not verylarge by any means, but perfect enoughfor what I need it for. The ceiling inhere has also been dropped um in orderto accommodate some HVAC system that wasup there before. And since this is goingto be a home theater setup, that's okayas well. During the development stage,um I had them insulate or doubleinsulate the walls and the ceiling inhere to make sure that it's assoundproof as possible. So, that's oneof the most important things that youwould want to consider for a hometheater setup is keeping all the soundcontained inside the room. That way youreally get that experience and also soyou don't have to disturb everybodyaround the house. For insulation, whatI've done is used uh 5/8 drywall. I'veused Sonopan which is a 38 um woodmaterial that's designed for uhsoundproofing as well. And I've alsoused rock in wool uh safe and sound. Soit's an it's a fiberglass system that isdesigned to help reduce sound and justgeneral energy loss from the room.Something else I've done here forsoundproofing is add a solid core doorwhich um in comparison to thealternative which is hollow core doorwill prevent sound and energy lossbetter. I also decided to add someweather stripping material around allthe edges to block any uh amount oflight or air from going in and out ofthe room. So that way like I said wekeep everything contained in here. Thelast thing that I've done in here toimprove the sound quality is add somecarpet. So, instead of using LVP, Idecided to go with um a nice carpet,soft uh and has a different design thanwhat you usually see from theconventional style carpets. Now, it'sgot a bit of a pattern all over it, sonothing crazy, but I think, you know, itworks well for this room right here.Now, we don't have much of it in here. Ionly picked up about 15 uh square yardsof it to fill up the entire room, and itworked out great. It fit the entirespace with very, very little wastage.The next thing I'm going to talk abouthere are the speakers in here. So, I'vedecided to go with a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmassystem um to create that reallyimmersive feeling when watching moviesor gaming in here. As you can see onboth sides, I've got the front left andfront right speakers, and I've also gotthe center channel um below at thebottom there. Behind the camera there,I've got two rear speakers, and I've gotsome overhead speakers up top as well.So, that's two, four, six, sevenspeakers in total and a subwoofer. So,the subwoofer isn't in here right now,but I'm going to have it on this side ofthe room, uh, just right there. So, I'vehad it all set up there. It's connectedor hardwired directly to my server rackon the other side. So, everything inhere is essentially hardwired to myserver rack on the other side where I'vealso got my AVR system. As you can see,I've also got some 6in tall baseboardshere. really gives the room uh kind of amore luxurious look, uh taller look.Even though it's already compressed, itgives it that look, which is reallynice. So, something else to note is thelighting that we've got in here. Ididn't do anything special. It's a 14-indual bright surface mount kit. Now, thiskit will allow you to use a dimmerswitch to control the color temperatureof the lights between 2K and 5K. So,warm white and daylight white. And I'vegot a Lutron dimmer switch connected toit in order to be able to do that. Now,check this out. So, right here, I canreduce or increase the temperature aswell as the brightness while uh usingthis light right here. So, somethingthat I really like about this lightright here, but I don't know how longit's going to be here. I might end upchanging it to something more fancy,something more uh extra, somethingthat's got RGB in it. I don't know. Butright now, I think it works out uh wellfor this room. For temperature controlin here, I've decided to go with a smartvent. So, I've got a single 8x 8 insquare vent um installed up there. So,it's a smart vent that connects to thecentral HVAC system that I've got um setup throughout the entire house. Thissystem will close and open the vent oncommand or on demand depending on whenit's needed. So, I've got a littlecontrol puck installed on the wall overthere to allow or enable that feature.This will allow me or anyone in here toeasily uh tweak the temperature to whatthey need it to be, and the vent willclose and open um as needed. I've got acutout in the ceiling on that sidethere, which is um connected to thebathroom. It's kind of a hatch that willgive me access to um a powered overheadshower that I've got in there. I knowit's something that's not common, but Ireally wanted to do that and I neededaccess um to the outlet that powers thatin the bathroom that will be covered upwith something so it will blend into thewall or the ceiling there and will notbe noticeable. The last thing I want tomention is I've got um a flex tube thatgoes across the entire ceiling to theback there. Um passing across HDMI cableand two Ethernet cables. So, Cat 6Ethernet cables and um an HDMI 2.1 uhcable that will allow me to connect theprojector to my AVR in the room behindme. All right, I'm not going to wasteany more time. Let's go ahead and putthis placetogether. After planning out the space,I quickly realized there was no way tofit side tables in the room withouthaving to compromise on the size of thecouch that I wanted. And trust me, thatjust was not an option I was evenremotely willing to consider. I lookedinto compact side table options thatmight work uh with the layout that Ihad, but nothing really hit the mark.Eventually, I decided to take mattersinto my own hands as usual and go theDIY route. While researching, I cameacross a few very clever setups wherepeople used wall shelves or woodenplanks to create DIY side tables. Thatgave me an idea. I picked up two Melanashelves from IKEA, one for each sidewhere the couch would go. These shelvesusually come in a few different colorsand uh two different length options. Formy setup, I needed them to line upneatly with the armrest. So, I went witha smaller size. Since I was alreadygoing the DIY route here, I figured whynot add some extra functionality, too. Ifound these 3-in recessed power gro thatcome with a built-in 15watt wirelesscharger on the surface. The top slidesopen to reveal two AC outlets, a 20 wattUSBC port, and a USB type A port.Basically everything that one would needto charge daily devices. I mean, they'retechnically designed for desks, but thisfelt like the perfect way to repurposethem. They come in black or white, but Ichose white so they blend in seamlesslywith the shelves. I also picked up a few2-in grommets to create passroughs forany cables running from above the shelfto below it, especially since theshelves are going to be mounted flushinto the corner. To start, I laid downpainters tape over the section I plan tocut. Then I used a measuring tape tomark out the exact length that wouldallow the shelves to line up perfectlywith the couch's armrests. Once themarks were in place, I grabbed mycircular saw and made the cuts. Next upwas drilling the grommet holes. Imeasured out the positions on both endsof each shelf. Larger holes for thepower gro and smaller ones for thepassroughs. I then went ahead andswapped in a circular drill bit matchedto the size of the grommets and drilledthrough the marked spots to create theholes. With the shelves prepped, it wastime to mount them. I started with theright hand shelf, marking the height onthe wall and using a long level to drawa straight guideline across the points.Since the Mlander shelf is originallydesigned to display picture frames, Imounted it upside down to get a flatsurface on the top. I mean, it's a sidetable after all. After installing 75lbwall anchors, I aligned the shelf, linedup the pre-drilled holes, and secured itto the wall. Once it felt solid onthere, I installed the power grommet,screwing it in place. It was a snug fitgetting the screw on piece past the lipof the shelf, but it worked. The passthrough grommet on the other side slidin easily since it didn't require ascrew on mount. I went on to repeat thesame process on the opposite side of theroom for the second shelf. Onceeverything was mounted and the Gro werein place, I tested the built-in chargingstations and everything worked asexpected, I was able to wirelesslycharge my key enabled phone both whenthe charger surface was in place andwhen it was slid off. If you knowanything about me or any of my spaces,then you know I'm a big fan of ambientlighting. So, naturally, that was thenext challenge. Since this room wasbuilt around using a projector, I knew Iwanted to keep the lighting minimal andvery intentional. I had some leftoverblack 90 degree LED diffuser channelsfrom previous projects, so I decided torepurpose them here. Each piece came ina fixed length, so I had to cut themdown to fit the vertical space from thetop of the shelves to the ceiling.Starting on the right side, I beganmounting clips to hold the channels inplace. Once I had a good numberinstalled, I slid the channel into theclips and locked it in. Then I moved onto the top piece, which required onefull length uh channel and anothershorter one to fill the remaining space.Before installing that final cut piece,I jumped over to the left corner andrepeated the same vertical installationprocess I did for the right corner.Although it was much quicker the secondtime around, the LED channel kit camewith corner connectors that allow for aseamless 90° transition. So, I usedthose at both top corners for a cleancontinuous flow of light. I wrappedthings up by installing the final cutchannel on the top side, making sure itjoined perfectly with the existing pieceusing that one's end clip. With thechannels fully mounted, I installed theCOB LED strip that I picked up earlierinside, snapped on the diffusers, andpowered it up using a Ziggb smartcontroller paired with a power adapter.Once everything was connected, I syncedthe lights to my smart home system,giving me full control over brightness,color, and a whole lot more. Next, Iadded a black PS5 controller to thesetup, placing it on a fast wirelesscharge that I picked up from Razer a fewyears ago. I used the pass through gammiI'd installed earlier to route thechargers power cable down to anextension box that I had positionedbehind the couch. I also used the sameextension box to power the other gummypiece on the right wall. To add a bit oftexture to the walls, I decided to pickup something called 3D wall decor panelsoff Etsy. They weren't like anythingthat I'd installed before, but with somehelp from Hannah, we managed to get themall up. Figuring out how to mount themonto the wall and ceiling was definitelythe most timeconuming part of the entireprocess. They didn't come with anyadhesive or mounting hardware, and theinstructions to install them were notclear at all. The seller suggested usingsilicone to hold them in place and ifneeded drive in screws into the sixpre-drilled holes on each base panel.That felt a bit excessive to us, so weended up grabbing some nails from HomeDepot and just used enough to secureeach piece to the wall and the ceiling.Was it the most optimal method? Probablynot, but it did get the job done. Thepanels are designed to form a 3Dhoneycomb pattern. And while they didn'tquite match my expectations perfectlyonce everything was up on the wall, Ihad to admit that it gave the room areally, really unique vibe. It alsohelped the ambient LED lighting standout more rather than just fading intothe plain white walls. We used a mix ofwhite, black, gray, and bronze panels tocreate some contrast and some visualinterest. As for the layouts, we triedour best to create a mirrored lookacross both sides of the room, which tobe frank was not easy at all, but Ithink we pulled it off pretty well. Now,full transparency, the panels weredefinitely pricey for what they are.Each box came in just one color, andsince we wanted four different tones, wehad to buy a few boxes of each color.That racked up the bill pretty quickly.We considered getting more to extend thepattern, but honestly, the cost was asolid hell no for me. At this point, theroom finally had that cozy home theatervibe I was going for, and it was justabout ready for the media setup. Beforethat, there was one last thing that Ihad to take care of, a DIY fix to coverthe ceiling access panel for the showerhead power. It definitely wasn't themost attractive feature in the space.So, I decided to create a cleanersolution. I had an MDF board cut to fitthe space, which I picked up from HomeDepot. Then I wrapped a white striparound all four sides to hide the rawedges and give it a more finished look.Next, I applied small strips of heavyduty double-sided tape around the backof the MDF. Then added weather strippingaround the edge of the ceiling opening.That was mainly to reduce sound and airtransmission through the corners. Asmall detail, but it made sense for amedia room setup. Finally, I pressed theMDF piece into place. The tape held itup nicely for now, but I wouldn't callit a permanent solution at all. It's aquick fix until I figure out a moresolid long-term option. With that out ofthe way, it was finally time to installthe projector. Since saving space was atop priority, I decided to go with aceiling mounted long throw projector.Now, there are a lot of options for thisout there, and I definitely didn't wantto settle for an underwhelming viewingexperience. So, I set a fewnon-negotiable specs the projector hadto meet before I'd even consider it forthe room. After a couple of weeks, Idecided on the Horizon Smax from XJimmy.Big shout out to the brand for sendingover a unit for me to try out. Right outof the box, the projector looked prettypremium and features a built-inadjustable stand with a mounting threadunderneath. There's also a power inputlocated on the base right there. One ofits standout design elements is theautomatic sliding lens cover, whichopens and closes to reveal the lightsource. It's a really neat feature thatadds to its already aesthetic gold misthue. When the cover is in the closedposition, you can see the built-inHarmon Cardan speakers. Although Iwouldn't be needing them for my setup,it's still really nice to have. Also inthe box was a pair of batteries, a poweradapter, and a remote. All having thesame gold mist hue as the projectoritself. It even came with a Google TV 4Kstick, which you get for free with apurchase of the projector. XJimmy alsosent out a couple of accessories uh forthe projector, including the ceilingmount and a floor stand. These do notcome standard with the projector, butare available as optional add-ons. Theceiling mount also has the protector'sgold mist aesthetic and comes in threepieces. It has a special compartmentthat houses the protector's power blockinside of it, keeping things reallyclean. The floor stand, on the otherhand, came in two easy to assemblepieces and the same gold mist aesthetic,though I do not plan on using it in thiscase. We moved on to installing theceiling mount next. The process waspretty straightforward and all I had todo was secure the power adapter insideits dedicated compartment, then securethe mounts to the ceiling using screwson all sides. I initially tried routingmy HDMI cable through the mount as well,but it made the cover not fit properly.So, I left that hanging out the back asit seems the mount cable management wasonly designed for the projector's powercable. The last step in the process wasattaching the mount's final piece to theprojector and then locking it into placeon the ceiling. It held up really welland from there, all that was left wasplugging in the power and the HDMIcable. The central control unit foreverything going into the projector isthe Pioneer VSSX 935 AVR, which I pickedup specifically for this setup. AVRshave been around for as long as I canremember, and honestly, they're stillone of the best solutions for unifiedhome the media control. That said,they're usually pretty bulky, so therewas no way I was going to have onesitting inside the actual movie room.Instead, I talked it neatly into mymedia rack right where it belongs. TheHDMI cable I connected to the projectorfeeds into one of the two HDMI outputports on the AVR, which is then linkedto all eight surround sound speakers inthe room, delivering a full highqualityaudio experience. On the input side, theAVR gives you eight HDMI input ports,which means I can connect everythingfrom gaming consoles to streamingdevices with ease. For streaming, Ipicked up an Apple TD4K with an Ethernetport and hooked it directly into boththe AVR and my network switch to ensurethe best possible connection. Trust me,there's going to be no buffer in here. Ialso brought in my first gen PS5, placedit on the media rack, and connected itto both the AVR and the Switch as well.With everything routed through the AVR,I've got centralized control,highfidelity audio, and ultra cleancable management, all without taking upspace in the actual viewing area. It'sphenomenal. I know. At this point, theroom already had that cozy home theatervibe I was aiming for. But the nextpiece we brought in took things to awhole new level. We decided to go withsomething called a cloud couch for theseating in the area. mainly because ofhow unbelievably comfy they usually are.The comfort level of a cloud couch isoften compared to what it would feellike to sleep on a real cloud, whichobviously explains the name. I've neverowned one myself before, but I've alwayswanted to, so I figured this was theperfect excuse to finally splurge. Andyeah, it was definitely a splurge. Thiscouch was not cheap by any meanswhatsoever, but I wanted to make sureevery second that was spent in this roomwas as comfortable as possible. Cloudcouches are fully customizable, kind oflike Maja sofas you see everywhere. Now,taking a room's layout and spaceconstraints into account, we went withtwo corner pieces, one centerpiece, andtwo ottomans. It also came with a bunchof soft oversized pillows, but we alsodecided to add a few accent ones for asubtle pop of color.I originally considered getting twosubwoofers for this space, buteventually realized that woulddefinitely be a bit overkill for such asmall space. One was more than enough toget the impact I was after. To keepthings consistent with the rest of theaudio setup, I went with a Pulk audiosub. It came in black, which didn'tmatch the white speakers, but honestly,it's subtle enough that it doesn't standout in a distracting way. Next up on theagenda was setting up the projector andall the media devices I had hooked up toit. As soon as the projector powered on,the first thing I did was pair it withthe remote and then went on to connectto Wi-Fi before jumping into the initialsetup process. The projector is equippedwith autofocus, which automaticallysharpens the image projected withoutneeding to do anything manually. There'salso a manual focus option if you wantto fine-tune it, but honestly, theautofocus worked perfectly right out ofthe box. Next was auto keystonecorrection, another time-saving featurethat adjusts the screen alignment inreal time. That alone made positioningway easier. Once that was set, I gotinto the manual alignment tools to tweakthe image just a bit further. It didn'ttake very long, just a few minorcorrections, and then I moved on to oneof the most interesting parts of thesetup. The projector gave me the optionto choose between the new dual light 2.0light source mode or the moretraditional laser mode. Dual light 2.0on the Horizon S Max offers higherbrightness up to 3100 lumens, a widercolor gamut, better contrast, andoverall more accurate color reproductionand also a more comfortable viewingexperience. Of course, I decided to gowith this new mode to see how it works.Another standout feature is the ultrawidec screen mode. Definitely a firstfor me on a projector. It's a very cooloption to have, especially if I decideto bring a gaming PC into the mix lateron. The Horizon S Max also comes withsomething called wall color adaptation,which helps calibrate the projector'scolors based on the surface it'sprojecting onto. I'm currently using thestandard white painted wall as myscreen. And even then, this featurehelped refine the color accuracy andimprove the overall image quality. Aftergetting through the initial setup, Imade a few physical adjustments to theprojector's angle, then went back intothe settings for another round of autokeystone correction along with somelight manual tweaking. You'll find allthe image correction tools likeautofocus, screen shift, image zoom, andmore right in the settings menu of theprojector. But honestly, there's notmuch that needs to be done manually.Most of it just works straight out ofthe box. Next, I switched theprojector's input source to the HDMIports connected to my AVR in the otherroom. A few seconds later, my Apple TVpopped up on the screen. No extra setupneeded since I'd already configured itbeforehand. The projector automaticallyenabled IMAX enhanced mode, which was anice touch. First thing I did was testout how it handled video playback frommy Plex server and other platforms. Now,while the video was playing, I realizedI hadn't turned on Dolby Vision on theApple TV. something the projector isfully capable of handling. So, I jumpedinto the settings menu and made theswitch immediately. I went ahead andtweaked a few more settings to match mypreferences, then continued the clip,this time with Dolby Vision fullyenabled. The result, phenomenal. Idecided to test out the PS5 digitalnext. I had that hooked up to thededicated HDMI 2.1 game port on the AVR.As expected, since it was connected to anew display, it walked me through theusual screen alignment and HDRcalibration process. After updating thesystem firmware, I jumped straight intoa session of God of War to see how wellthe projector handled realtime gaming.And honestly, it did not disappoint. TheHorizon Sax also has game optimizingfeatures, uh, like low latency and awhole lot more, which can be accessedthrough the settings menu as well. MyXbox Series X hadn't been getting muchuse in its previous location. So, Iadded it to the media rack to sitalongside the PS5 as well. Just like Idid with the PS5, I hooked it up with ahardwired internet connection for themost reliable performance and thenplaced an Xbox controller on anotherwireless charger stored neatly on thesame wall shelf. Once powered on, Ioptimized the Series X for the Horizon SMax and loaded up Assassin's CreedOdyssey for a quick gaming session.What's a home theater without snacks andbeverages? Just outside of the roomwithin my studio space, I've got a wetbar setup complete with storage drawersand a mini fridge stocked for movienights, gaming sessions, and everythingin between. At the end of it all, theroom turned out even better than I'dimagined, and it fully delivered on thepurpose that I had in mind for it. Thankyou guys for sticking with me throughoutthis one. I really appreciate it. Let meknow down in the comment section whatpart of the room you like the most. Andif you're curious about any of theproducts I used uh throughout thisvideo, including the powerful HorizonSmax, be sure to check out thedescription box below for all the links.Thanks again for watching, and I hope tocatch you in my next video. It's Tommy,and I'm out, y'all.[Music]","You're such an inspiration and I love your calm energy. Even though I'm 31, I still aspire to be like you and your stability.
I'm currently living in a shelter with my beautiful family living from paycheck to paycheck in LA. Hopefully, I can reach your stability someday.
Bro your setups are always INSANE! The details, your ability to build anything, and those 3D wall panels!
Yessir, the perfect kick back and relax video after a long day of work
Awesome setup. If you're going to get a screen raise the centre channel so it's in line with your left and right and get an acoustic transparent screen.
You should definitely consider adding a screen to your projector setup — it would elevate the overall aesthetic of the room and prevent the space from feeling incomplete when the projector is off. Additionally, the Apple TV isn’t configured correctly for Dolby Vision HDR. You’ll want to leave Dolby Vision disabled under Format settings, and instead enable Match Dynamic Range and Match Frame Rate in the Match Content settings. Excellent video — keep up the great work.
you won't believe how long i have waited for this episode following the previous ones
This video has definitely inspired me to step my game up
Bruh those polygon panels is dope AF! Awesome room!
You're an impressive dude. Great inspiration for old and young alike
It’s grommet (grom-met) not (grom-may). Nicely done, I’m so jealous of your setups , bro! Lol.
The fact that you’re Nigerian and achieving all of this really inspiring can’t lie 
I’m really motivated mennn
Nice setup, if you get/got an acoustically transparent screen you could put your LCR all in line at the same level right behind the screen that would them match the voices to the dialogue coming from the screen rather than from the floor. A huge difference in the sound performance of your system. I'm sure your past that point so maybe an upgrade in the future, but a dedicated space in and of itself is amazing.
Theaters are painted black not white. To minimize light bouncing off the ceiling and walls
Great setup, really nice. Congrats. I would consider raising your center channel to ear level, go with a darker color for your walls, and lastly, install acoustic panels to kill sound reflections from the speakers and it will improve your listening experience.
it looks really good! the contrast of colors is super clean!
Get a screen first of all, and you need to make your room darker, preferably with black velvet materials for better contrast.
This was a great watch. super chill diy, great job.
Picking up on just little bit of that island accent. Not enough there to tell where from, but it's there, my man! Love your content, bredda
Nize setup i have a white wall too for home cinema but i prefere dark walls more, so that bright scenes doesnt bounce off all over the place but it may be personal preference
FYI, you should change your Apple TV setting to 4k SDR 60hz. And then set “match for content”. Otherwise everything will be displayed in HDR (up converted).
New to the channel. Love the full walkthrough build of your home theater
felicidades, ese cuarto es increiblemente estupendo, buen sonido, bonita imagen, comodo y completamente apartado de los ruidos exteriores, increiblemente bello.
bros living in paradise
Absolutely love the setup, awesome work !
The only thing I would add would be another shelf behind the back of the couch so who ever is in the middle will also have somewhere to put things or u can use it just for a little extra storage space. This is something I even want to do for my own living room couch, just an idea. But I love the whole set up!!
All i can see is a fire keep it up bro
The style and everything is amazing. I think my IRIS Device agrees bc the “take a break” notification popped up w/o muting or even pausing your video. Subscribed!
The issue with using AVR’s for hdmi is the older ones are usually not hdmi 2.1 passthrough. People should check that because you can lose quality when running next gen consoles like PS5. The pioneer vsx935 in this video from 2021 does have 2.1 though. Just something for the viewers to check. If you’re running an older AVR for sound then you should run the 2.1 device straight to the tv/projector, then run a digital optical cable straight back to the AVR. Or if you have a tv with a HDMI ARC/eARC you can use that HDMI input as your hdmi input from the AVR to the tv ARC means Audio Return Channel so it has 2 purposes- Sending video to the tv from the AVR and also audio from the tv back to the AVR
Looks great man. Also worth mentioning, that Halo 20th Anniversary edition Series X is fiiiireeee. Damn it's awesome.
Gj mate ! Room looks amazing .
Super cool and creative hopefully you get good use of the room
DopeNess As Always Brother!!! When you guys were installing the honeycomb decor… 13:19 I was like da hell going on here Yall Got it Looking Good!! Take Care Brother!!
You already know it's gon be a banger
Nice! I think i saw another video of yours that was just a soundbar. AVR with surround sound is the way to go! Very nice. I would have elevated the center with a screen that allows audio passthrough, had 4 heights and had external amps, but im sure you did your research and got exactly what you wanted. The server rack always keeps things organized! Very nice! Next upgrade, think about bass shakers. Nice wetbar
Amazing set up. Would highly recommend using a screen. Even the best newest sheet rock will dull your picture. Sheetrock is not designed to display a projector, obviously u can do it. It’s like shinning an extremely bright light on your wall. Even the cheapest of screens will offer a better viewing experience. Don’t take my word for it, do your own reasearch and you can always try a screen and see how it goes and return it if it’s not helping. the one upside to not having a scree with your projector is you can switch very easily from 16:9 to wide screen. And most movies are in widescreen, but not all. Not having a screen would allow you to switch back and forth easily. They make screens like that, but they are highly expensive. Good luck. Love that couch
I didnt know avr was a thing till now , Great video and very informative
Wow, Great set up. Love what you have done to the place. When can I move in?
It's beautiful, and makes me reluctant to nitpick -- but as an HT designer fora long time, I would have said to go AT to prevent those LR speakers from being jammed in the corners, and the center being so low. That said, the space is very inviting.
i was so exited to see what do you mean for a home theater 
and here it is the video
let see what you cooked for us
good luck bro
much love to you from Iran
Good video bro and nice man cave
Same as acoustic panels, there are diffusion panels for video projectors, you have pollution from the ceiling as you can see
You did a great job on room
Always well paced and informed videos, that explain and show what needs to be. Great room again
Ive been waiting to watch this, i had it saved on watch later and i wish i had seen it sooner, AC odyssey was quite a platinum along with god of war Ragnarok
You guys are bosses fantastic job
I have been waiting for this one!
Good vid man ... Gave me some ideas for my own set up
Gangsta man cave my bro
would have used a magnetic latch and use some hinges on that access panel since it likely will be opened again.
My fav part was the bathroom
Giving some ideas bro! Great content
Nice video dude, as always.
We need a full blown 2 hr tutorial of how that server rack and all the components interconnect into one another I wanna do that my self
Looks good
I was literally just watching an old video of yours bro
Good Job
You'll likely be getting a huge amount of audio reflections off the front left and right side walls right up to the speakers, because they are against the side wall. You need accoustic panels there. Ideally they should have been closer in off the walls, but too late now. Such an enclosed small refective space for audio isn't going to be great anyway, but the furniture would help a lot. Still, you really need something to fix those front speakers.
Also, how do you breath in there? I'd be worried about poor ventilation in such a sealed space. How does the air coming in even get out?
Man can u tell me what is your work? Damn it was so crazy to watch your videos
the best gaming setup
The best way to do an installation at home and be able to solve any future problems is to do it yourself, since this way you do not depend on anyone to solve your problems... Yes, I know that not everyone can, either because of knowledge or possibility, but that is the reality.
For the ceiling cover I would use magnets
Why you didnt use a panel and used the all wall? And how you control the devices that are on the other room? Thanks for the videos. Fantastic
Personally the wall panels were a lot! I would've used them on the back wall only
Where did you get the cloud couch from, it is fire
Nice set up. Do you have a link to that carpet? Thanks!
link to couch?
damnnnnnnnnnn, am jaw opened, i always tell people of your setups, TOP NOTCHH
Just FYI, grommets are prounounced ""Grom-mets""...not ""Grom-Mays"".
Love your vids. FYI, grommet is pronounced ""graa·muht"".
Fantastic work. How big is your room in dimensions?
love it! One thing though, it's pronounced ""grahm-ette"" not ""grahm-ay"" lol had me chucklin a lil bit. Seriously though you did a fantastic job!!!
Nice
Great Video. I always wait for new videos. By the way, how you can control your Pioneer AVR from your tv room and choose which HDMI output for example?
You should have went with a laser TV projector with an ALR screen.
7.1.4 is ideal
Bro, this is a fantastic space, that honeycomb is just But I am curious, after my own experience with an ultra short throw projector, why didn't you consider that? Something like the Hisense PX3 that I reviewed recently would be incredible. Love the work here dawg and I can't wait to see more of the house.
Awsome
Bro works out his biceps with cement trucks
Bro, how are you Upgraded? . Great video
you have a great set up but your are not getting full advantage from the projector using a wall , get a nice white screen with 1.1 gain and thank me later and if you want deeper black and color an ALR screen material will suit you very well

So,that's sort of what I'm doing today. I'malso going to be, you know, updating andupgrading this desk setup here. Um, notthe biggest thing ever, but I'm going todive into that. U, but fun fact, KTCsent me this monitor like 6 months ago,and I forgot to make a video about it.And I think today's um a better day thanany to sort of dive in mainly becauseI'm uh updating this desk setup here uphere in my bedroom. Now, this setupparticularly is a little bit different.Um I guess you could say it's a bit morespecial. Mainly because um compared to,you know, my basement setup that I spenda lot of time at, this place up here inmy bedroom is only meant for rest andrelaxation. Whereas in my basement, Ispend myself spending a lot of timethere. Yes, I do, you know, have thechance to game and relax and watch showsand all that. Um, but I find myselfworking a whole ton down there. Andsometimes I feel like I'm sort ofrotting or I'm getting stale. And uh,plus it's nice to get some naturalsunlight, which I do get up here in mybedroom. So, yeah, despite having, youknow, my dream setup down in thebasement, um, I feel a lot of pressureoften to work down there cuz that's theplace where I do my day job as anaccountant as well as all my YouTube,which, you know, it's more so a hobby,but sometimes I feel pressure to makevideos. So, up here, at least, this iswhere I'm going to get my full rest andrelaxation. Now, in this scenario, thismonitor at least is the KTC G27 P6S, Ithink it's called. I'm going to leave alittle note here if that's right orwrong, but um that's the model number.And pretty much this is a 1440p OLEDmonitor, um which is actually theupgraded version of what could be myfavorite 1440p monitor of all time. Ithink I used the previous model of thisspecific monitor um the most out of anymonitor I've ever reviewed or bought oranything. So, I'm pretty pumped to havethe upgraded version of it and I'll sortof talk about a bit of the differencesum with this one. But sadly, I don'thave the previous model because it didget water damaged. Um but that's why I'mpretty stoked to have the newer versionof it. Now, as for why this particularmonitor is um a little bit more specialat least is because it's just soincredibly versatile and I find itprobably one of the best options interms of affordability and the featureset you're actually getting. For me atleast, that's going to be things like,you know, watching shows, movies, mediain general. Um, as well as, of course,myself as a gamer, I'm going to betalking heavily about, you know, consolegaming. And recently, I got back into myPC gaming, which is a huge bonus forthis. And definitely while this setup isprimarily sort of my oasis away fromwhere I typically get all my accountingwork done, um I do actually love to workon YouTube. So there is a productivityaspect to this display, um especiallyediting, which I'll talk about. Andagain, while I'm a bit of a wannabeminimalist, um I say wannabe because I Iown way too much stuff, especially as atech channel, it's hard not to. But as awannabe minimalist, I really umappreciate minimal setups. And with thisdisplay, at least with the KVM andstuff, it does sort of allow me to havea more minimal setup without reallysacrificing all too much, which I'lltalk about. Now, for this display atleast, it is a 27inch size, which stillsort of remains my favorite display sizedue to, you know, the balance betweenresolution, um, clarity, as well as theactual footprint and size of the displayitself. Um, not only that, it's justhardware- wise, it's a lot easier to run1440p at 240 Hz. Now, in terms of all,you know, the ports and connectivity,like I mentioned, this is a veryversatile monitor, particularly in thissetup because, um, it has two HDMI 2.0ports. I'm only using one of them for myPlayStation 5. Um, it has a displayport, which goes to my PC, um, for my PCgaming. And then it does have a type-Cport, which is probably my favoritething about this monitor. I I'll sayit's probably tied for my favoritething. And that has 65 watt powerdelivery, which is awesome. Now, whatsort of ties my PC and whatever I haveplugged into that type-C together is thebuilt-in KVM, which pretty much allowsme to to um connect all my peripheralsor whatever else between those twodevices, and it just swaps between them,which is awesome. So, if you have, youknow, wireless dongles or whatever, uhyou can just connect that to the KVM andit goes between both the machines. Thereis also an audio jack here if you dowant to plug in, you know, like aheadset or a set of speakers orsomething. Um, definitely good to have.Particularly, I will say the built-inspeakers here are uh excellent. likemore than excellent and I'll talk aboutthat as well. Um, so I don'tparticularly have it. Again, I want tokeep my setup minimal, but the autojackis there if you need it. And fun factabout this monitor is that the panelitself is from LG, which is prettybadass. Um, this is the newer genversion of this of the panel. Again, Iwas talking about the previous versionof this model. The difference is thatthe newer one has MLA plus, which uhpretty much makes it get a lot brighter,which is awesome. I wasn't expectingthat. So, kudos KTC. Um definitely ahuge plus having a brighter display. Nowin terms of you know this setup as awhole and this monitor specifically is Ipretty much have everything I need inthis setup as you know minimal as it canbe. Um I recently got back into PCgaming like I mentioned and this thisthing over here is through the displayport of course and this is probably thesmallest um RTX 4070 PC I've ever found.Um that's an ASUS ROG Knuck which isflipping awesome. Pairs well at 1440pgaming. And of course I do have my goodold faithful PlayStation 5. Uh, I lovemy PS5. I love my console gaming. I'mone of those guys that loves both. So,um, that makes it into the setup. Ofcourse, for me at least, again, after along day, my favorite thing to do isgaming. It's always gaming. I do love towatch my shows and movies and all that,but gaming is usually my go-to if I havethe option to do it. It really is justone of those things that actually letsme slow down and relax. And of course,I'll talk more about gaming uh in amoment. Now, in terms of the type-Cport, I'm primarily going to be justusing this for my M4 MacBook Air, maybemy M4 iPad Pro. Um, not my work laptopwhatsoever. This this place is my nowork zone, which is awesome. Um, I don'tcount YouTube particularly as work. Um,despite the time that goes into videosand stuff, that's just one of my funhobbies that I love and I love creationwork. I love editing. I love makingvideos. So, my M4 MacBook Air will gothrough that type-C board. Um, likewise,again, that has connectivity to um theKVM switch, which right now I actuallyam powering this light bar on my monitorthat's going through the KVM port umjust because it draws power anyways. So,um, that works perfect as well as mygaming mouse. So, my gaming mouse goesthrough there. My keyboard specificallyis Bluetooth. I'm okay with that. Again,I'm not much, um, as a tryhard as Ipreviously was for, you know, usingdirect plugged or dongles and stuff forthe 2.4. I'm just going Bluetooth on mykeyboard and it works perfectly fine.Beyond that, during the night time, thisthis room gets insanely dark and thissetup is really dark. Um, apart fromthis light bar on top, I never use thebig light anywhere. Any any of theceiling lights I never use. Um, I preferto have a more relaxed sort of cozysetting, but this is still super dark. Ihave my portable lamps. You guys haveseen in a thousand videos. I love theseflipping lamps. I bring them with mealmost everywhere I'm reading or workingor whatever it is. Um, but I'm actuallygoing to get it. I got this new littlething. I got I got this light for like15 bucks. It's a GOI light. Um, it's thesame light strip that I use on mybasement desk setup, and it's actually aTV backlight, but it was like 12 or 15bucks or something. So, um, I like toput these around the edge of my desksbecause it helps illuminate against thewall and brings some light into thespace. And I can set it to whatevercolor I want, which is awesome. So,yeah, I'm going to go ahead and set thisup today. Um, as well as some[Music]gaming. But yeah, that's the setup. It'spretty basic. Um, somewhat minimalisticand I really dig it, especiallyeverything plugged into the monitoritself. Uh, honestly, it's just an easyway to have a nice dope lookingaesthetic setup. Plus, the Groveade deskshelf and the Wool Pad um do make a hugeaccent to this whole thing. So, Ireally, really dig it. Now, to actuallytalk a bit about um gaming. What thismonitor really particularly excels at, Ican say, is PC gaming. I actually tookum a pretty hefty break from PC gamingover the last, you know, three and ahalf, maybe four months after goingsuper hard into competitive Overwatch. Ihit the rank I wanted to hit and then Isort of burnt out and uh took a bit of abreak. I have been console gaming umparticularly during that time period. Umso it is most definitely refreshingcoming back to PC gaming. A because I'mgetting back into competitive games. I'mnot trying as hard as I was previously,but it is again nice to hop back intothose hero shooters I love. And b 240hertz. I've been uh playing at 120 Hzfor quite some time over the last bit.So it's a good bump in refresh ratewhich I really do appreciate. thatparticularly is going to be awesome whenit comes down to those hero shooters Imentioned. For me at least, I've alwayssort of just been drawn to uh heroshooters. I've been playing Overwatchsince its beta. And more recently, I'vegotten into uh you know, Marvel Rivalscuz that game is flipping awesome.Definitely a fun time. It's similar butdifferent enough that I'm still having agreat time with it. And uh it's a goodtime to play on PC. For me at least, I'mnot, you know, I don't expect myself tobe the top 500 player I once was or evengrand masters and stuff, but it is niceto hop back into PC gaming. For me atleast particularly, it's going to be,you know, the 0.03 millisecond responsetime on here that does make thecompetitive difference. Always somethingI appreciate when it comes to OLEDpanels. And they just look really good.In terms of the actual resolution, thisis 1440p like I mentioned before. Andhonestly, I find this to be the absoluteperfect balance um in terms ofmodern-day gaming. Not only does 1440pstill look incredible in terms of, youknow, fidelity, details, graphics, evenoutside of gaming, it's going to lookreally good, but it's also a lot easierto run on modern hardware, even olderhardware. You can get 1440p at 60 Hz,you can get 1440p at 120 Hz. Um, for me,again, my PC bounces anywhere between120 Hz to 240 Hz depending on the gameI'm playing. And 1440p sort of gives methat option depending on what I want tochoose. Now, since this is an OLED panelas well, and this sort of goes in handwith media as well, not just gaming, isthat OLED panels really do lookincredible. And honestly, it's reallyhard to match up to them. I've revieweda ton of different panel types from, youknow, fast IPS to VA to TN, all thesedifferent displays. They look good.They're not bad by any means, but whenyou compare that to, you know, the inkyblacks of OLED and the rich colors andthe infinite contrast ratios, it's hardnot to, you know, see the benefits of anOLED panel. Now, if you haven't heard ofan OLED panel, compared to somethinglike LCD, um LCDs, they will havedimming zones where those zones, if theywant to reach closer to black, they'lljust dim down, right? That's whatthey're called, dimming zones. Theproblem is th those zones are, you know,little blocks on the panel. Um they canonly go so dim. So, the blacks somewhatlook like dark grays. Um now, with OLEDpanels, uh the pixels individually turnon and off. So, when the pixel is off togive you black, it literally is black.Um, so that's why OLED panels look asincredible as they do. And not thatit's, you know, a huge comparison. I'lljust have a quick um photo or clip hereshowing my iPad. I guess I'll use myiPad, which is I think an LCD, whatever.Again, that isn't to say LCD is bad, butmy absolute preference comes down toOLED. Again, hopping from uh myPlayStation or my Xbox Series X back toPC for Marvel Rivals. A, I'm gettingabsolutely stomped on because I'm rustyas heck on PC. Uh, but man does it lookgood, especially at that 240 Hz. I loveRivals. It's an awesome game. So, if youhaven't tried it yet, definitely give ita try. But yeah, if I do want to slow itdown a bit, I recently did get back intoWorld of Warcraft for the first time inlike 5 or 6 years, and people warned menot to get back into it. Um, it's a fungame, but honestly, right now, as atired ass dad, I don't have a lot oftime in the first place, so I trulycan't commit to it like I once did aslike a top 100 North America raider andall that. I don't have time for that.Right now, I'm playing casually for thefirst time in my life. and it's a goodtime. So, if you want to try World ofWarcraft, give it a go or don't. It canbe addicting depending on who you are.Um, but yeah, for me right now, it'snice to play casually. But yeah, apartfrom World of Warcraft, I do love myDiablo I is always a good time. Um, aswell as games like Red Dead Redemption2. Absolutely incredible game. I love toplay those um to test out any monitorsI'm on, and that's always a good timefor those games. Now, of course, Iabsolutely love my PC gaming. And Idon't get it, but people seem to thinkI'm crazy that I love console gaming aswell as PC gaming. It's like it's acrime to love both for some magicreason. But again, I love my PlayStation5. Um, particularly I will say for somereason, I don't know what it is, but theHDR experience on console um alwayssweeps the floor with my PCs regardlessof what the spec on my PC is. Um, I'mnot sure if that's a Windows thing, um,a PC thing. Either way, I love the HDRperformance on here. Now, I'm not one toever particularly test my monitors. Idon't calibrate them. I don't measuretheir peak brightnesses and stuff. So,I'll leave a link in the description ifyou do want to check out somebody elsewho's smarter than I am and tested allthis stuff. Um, Display Ninja, I thinkit is. Um, they they check out all thepeak brightnesses of HDR and stuff, butif I'm not mistaken, the SDR brightnessuh is brighter on this one. Again, it'sabout 275 nits for SDR content. Butagain, where it shines for meparticularly, it's going to be the HDRgaming on console. I love it. Um, if I'mnot mistaken, the you know, 1% peakbrightness is 1300 nits, which isactually pretty flipping awesome. Andagain, that goes in hand with my umediting that I've had a chance to do onthis monitor. This entire video thatyou're watching right now was edited onthis monitor. Um and I absolutely loveit for that. Again, on my PlayStation 5at least, I love to play games like umCyberpunk to really flex the HDRcapacity on uh these systems as well asthe display. And it does look absolutelyflipping awesome. And for the most partright now, um I'm still gettingabsolutely dunked on in Elden Ring. Umbut it is a good time. Elden Ring iskept at 60 Hz. Um, and depending on thegame you are playing, it might be 60 Hzor 120 Hz. Okay, so I'm actually editingthis video right now and um, I'm notsure if the spec sheet online isincorrect, but it says HDMI 2.0, but Iwas playing my PS5 last night and bothVRR and ALM worked on my PS5, which istypically only available on HDMI 2.1.Um, so yeah, I think this has HDMI 2.1,um, which is definitely a welcomeupgrade over the last iteration of thismonitor. Still, I do find the consoleexperience awesome. And this is wherethe majority of my slower games arewhere I can sort of relax a little bitmore um if I don't feel like playing anysort of hero shooters or anything. Andagain, the speakers on this display areawesome, which are great for any sort ofconsole players. You just plug it in andaway you go. Now, to lean back into theimage aspect of this display again, umI've been spending a healthy amount oftime actually watching shows for oncethis year. Um again, finding a betterbalance between work and media andrelaxing and whatever the heck it is.Um, I've been watching shows on hereright now. My go-to is Invincible. I'mfinishing that up. Incredible show, bythe way. Thank you guys for thesuggestions on that. Um, I mentionedthat in my last video, and boy is thatshow wild. But yeah, it's not justanimated content. I find anime looksbest on OLEDs and stuff, but pretty muchanything I've thrown on here, um, looksgood. And I've been spending a goodamount of time watching shows instead ofjust working myself into oblivion. Butthe comment section has been popping offwith, uh, suggestions for media andgames and shows and books. Um, so, thankyou guys. I think the next thing I'mgoing to watch is either Arcane or SoloLeveling, one of those two. Um because Ijust discovered anime for the first timein like the last year, year and a halfor something like that. But beyond that,the speakers I mentioned, um it's a dual5 watt setup. I don't know if the specsheet's lying u because they soundbetter than dual 5 watt and I've hadlots of dual 5 watt speakers in monitorsbefore that sound awful. So, I don'tknow if it's because, you know, this hasa bit of a bulbous uh back end. I'm notsure if acoustically the speakers can dobetter. They don't sound like 5 watts. Idig them. They sound great. Um, again,it sort of allows me to have a moreminimal setup and not have externalspeakers. For me, they're excellent. Butif you want something more than that, ofcourse, you do always have the audiojack.[Music]But yeah, obviously these speakersaren't going to beat an external set ofuh speakers, but they do sound good. Um,if good is the middle point for audioquality, these are uh a good chunk pastthat. But yeah, beyond gaming and mediaand stuff, for the times that I do, youknow, want to do some productive work,particularly YouTube. Again, I don'tparticularly classify it as work, Ireally do enjoy it as one of my hobbies.Um, so the type-C port is definitelymeant for my MacBook Air. Um, and thisentire video was actually edited on thisdisplay uh through the type-C port. Ican definitely say during, you know, theediting phase, color grading and stufflooks awesome on an OLED panel. Andperformance overall is excellent. So, nocomplaints. I will say too, um, with thenewer LG panel, again, like I mentioned,this is a newer generation of the panel.So, a lot of people had complaints aboutthe first generation or whatevergeneration, the previous one, people hadcomplaints about text um with colorfringing. Uh, and I can say that'smostly just gone. I've never personallybeen sensitive to um fringing on text,but it is mostly gone here if that'ssomething that you're worried about. Butyeah, working on any sort of YouTuberstuff won't, you know, encroach into myrelaxing zone because that is relaxingfor me. I really do dig making YouTubevideos. Um, that's why I mentioned thatas a part of this setup. Now, I sort ofmentioned it before. As much as I lovemy basement setup, um I spend a lot oftime down in my basement. It's dark,there's no natural light, and um it'sagain it is my dream setup, uh butsometimes I feel pressured to work downthere. Uh which is why I have this sortof setup up here in my bedroom where Ican a get natural light and b sort ofescape from just being in the same placeall the time for myself at least. Justtrying to find a bit of a better worklife balance. Um when I sit herespecifically and again I'm very verygrateful to have a secondary spot tosort of sit at. In this spot, I can givemyself permission to actually be adegenerate and just watch more than just20 minutes of a show after the kids goto bed or actually just play World ofWarcraft for a couple hours, which is aa bit of a new thing for me to playgames more than 30 minutes or so. Butyeah, some of the things for a desksetup for me at least that are importantis the setup's got to look good. It'sgot to be functional and whatever I'mdoing's got to look damn good. Um, whichis in part by this monitor when it comesdown to media, gaming, or whatever else.Honestly, prior to 2025 at least, Ialways found myself just rushing to thenext thing, whether that's mydestination, finishing a task orproject, a YouTube video. I wouldsometimes rush those. I would only playhero shooters for the quick matches andstuff. So, finally actually allowingmyself to sort of do nothing has beenthe best absolute thing for myself thisyear. Um, if you haven't done nothing ina while, give it a try. But yeah, if youfind yourself similar to me in thatsituation where you're rushing to thenext everything, you're going to beokay, dude. just slow down and enjoyyourself as corny as that is. But yeah,but obviously you don't have to listento some random dude on the internet talkabout a gaming monitor and his desksetup. Uh but if you feel like you needto slow down, just slow down. You'll begood. Anyways, for me at least, thiswhole desk setup will be my designatedunproductive zone and I'm okay withthat. Plus, it looks awesome. And I willhave everything linked down below if youdo want to check out anything in mysetup. Um, of course, the monitor aswell. KTC, thank you for sending this tome 6 months ago. Sorry it took me thislong to make a video. Either way, I amgoing to enjoy this dopeass monitor.Play some more World of Warcraft. And ifany of you guys are WoW nerds, add meup. I'll have my battle tag in thecomment section. We can run somedungeons casually, of course. If any ofyou anime nerds out there have anysuggestions, leave them down below aswell. I would love to hear them. Iappreciate you guys watching till theend. Till next time. I don't want to letyou down.[Music]Yeah, I know we have fall","Thanks KTC for sending this out a while back! Perfect addition to the setup.

Consoles have really carved in their place for me as I get older. At the end of the day, I like to lay on the comfortable couch and consoles are such a better experience for that. Switching between media apps and games with only a controller is just so convenient
This channel makes me feel like I'm not alone on this. Ever since getting a pc in 2020 coming from being a console gamer my whole life I was molded into someone who would end up shitting on console just because pc gaming is a ""better experience"" when in reality I've come full circle to realizing I enjoy them both but still love my console gaming. Going for trophies, getting to play on a big TV in a more relaxed way I've started to care less about every game running and looking the absolute best and just enjoying games again not being so picky.
The unique things in your videos is the just relaxing way you narrate the whole thing and really appreciate the minimalist approach, kinda the back to home feeling I dream about too after a long day of work.... keep up the great work brother
Your voice and chill vibe to your videos is why I keep coming back. Thanks for what you do.
Another brilliant video, so much good info.
I don't know why I always assumed this room was a studio shed in your backyard. Probably the vintage door. 

In love with the aesthetic
idk if you have watched AOT yet but if not it is a must watch, you just have to get through the first 2 seasons. If you have then Solo is a great option!
Great view from the window buddy, well done for buying oled, sleeping cowboy in the barn
Solo leveling is a must watch. I watch Abit of Invincible and Arcane. Every Sunday, I was chasing the next episode of Solo leveling. Now waiting for Season 3.
I’ve done both console and PC all my life. Sometimes one more than the other. The 90’s were a mix of snes/ps1 and DOS. 2000’s were Xbox 360. Then PS4 and PC. Now more PC than PS5
i would watch Cowboy Bebop. Its worth your time!
Arcane is fantastic! Watching Solo Leveling now with the wife it it's pretty dang good too.
omg motorola razer 
Nice video, dude! Really down to earth one :) Will check this monitor, because that's exactly what I would like to do: PC/Console + Mac. Cables prerouted, just plug in and work and swap between devices! 
P.S. Fellow ow player :) the games and the shows you've mentioned are peak!
Kinda sad this brand isnt available locally to where I am at the moment. Great review btw~! keep it up~!
I also game on console and PC! I also have the first generation PS5 and last year I built my first gaming PC! My suggestion for anime show is definitely Attack on Titan!!! I think you would like it! It has a great story to it! I enjoy your videos, I’m hoping to finally get my channel up and running soon! Have a great day!!!
Probably mentioned in the comments but definitely watch arcane before solo leveling. I've watched both and they're both good but the story in arcane is just something else! Though by all means if you just want a good fun watch without crazy lore then yeah, Solo Leveling is peak.
Hey there, your vids are super chill and cozy love to see them come up on my feed, question how do you get that clock onto your iPad?
You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen Solo leveling. I think you will enjoy it.
PS5 for AAA and AA games and mini pc for indie games for me as 41 YO gamer. Still love pc gaming but don't want to deal with today's insane pc part prices anymore
I’m still waiting on my 5070Ti PC, but from what I’ve been playing on my 3050 6GB Laptop I don’t understand how I was able to sit on a controller for so long and tolerate the weirdness that is aiming in a competitive shooter style game. I’m switching to PC on shooter style games, and console for less aim reliant games.
what kind of chair are you using?
Do you still use the C4 as a monitor?
I saw your comment on spawnpoiint channel about LG 45 5K2K, I'm wondering if you're going to review that monitor?
Great video as always & a great monitor. Just ordered it with your link … I might have missed it but is it VESA compatible?
Hi , great content as always , super chill vibe . I wanna ask do you route rgb light strips only on the back of your desk or on the sides too ? I really want to try some Govee lights ,also do you buy extra diffusers for them ?
Are you going to be getting a review sample of the new LG 5k2k monitor? Really debating returning my LG 32inch 4k monitor for it.
Do you collect any older systems like PS2 or GameCube? Or do you think emulation is the way to go?
Hows thermals on your Asus Nuc for long playing sessions of 3-4 hrs ?
May i know your ipad mini standby time is which app?
Whats the game @7:48
Yo what’s the name of that anime girl background in the video?
video looks like a 720p video, =S no 4k
sorry i dont sub to channels that are fake gamers talk about gaming but nice setup man i only sub too lets plays channels like my self i am a lets play channel as well .
PLEASE GIVE ME VICTRIX PRO BFG I MORE THEN NEED THEN YOU

fullgaming setup and after spending $800we're going to see if they're actuallyworth it all right y so yeah you guyssaw the intro you guys heard the introwe're just going to get right into itthough grab our phone and go on Amazonright now and yeah I'm going to pull upthe screen right here that what I'mlooking at but we're on Amazon right nowyou can see we're on the website uh themost important thing that we need isactually a gaming PC though I mean whatelse is going to power this setupbesides a gaming PC so let's just searchthat scroll down a little bituh the overall pick is actually a cyberpower PC right here um yeah Amazon'sChoice overall pick as you guys can seeuh this one is$650 it has a ryzen 5 5500 and an RX6400 so yeah not bad um Amazon's choiceso guess it doesn't really matter whatthe specs are we're going to have to getit regardless so yeah let's just addthat to cart and let's go on to the nextthing so yeah now we need peripheralsfor the gaming setup obviously we havethe PC now we need a keyboard and or amouse so let's just search up gamingkeyboard um overall pick right here okayuh well this one is the red dragons101 gaming keyboard this thing actuallyhas 46,0 340 reviews so this isdefinitely the overall pick but it alsocomes with a mouse as well so we're notgoing to have to get a mouse I guess wehave to add a cart we don't really havean option at least we have this 15% offcoupon that it gave us but yep let'slet's just add that to card I guess whyam I even doing this video right now I'mI'm going to go broke really quick guysif your gaming setup is always a messwith controllers everywhere Tangledcables and just no space for yourheadset you need this this right here isthe my thing Logic storage rack and it'sthe all-in-one storage rack that keepsyour gaming gear organized and easy toaccess it's built to hold everythinglike your PS5 Xbox switch controllersheadsets and even your keyboards so itjust clears up so much clutter what Ipersonally love about this storage rackis that it's built to last the heavyduty metal frame can handle your entiresetup so it can hold many heavy itemslike monitors or anything like that plusthe ventilated design keeps yourconsoles cool while you're gaming andthe best part about it is that it'sactually on Wheels so it's super easy tomove around and you can actually lockthe wheels if you want to so if you guyswant a cleaner and more organized gamingsetup make sure to check out my thinglogic with the first links in thedescription but now the next part of thesetup that we're going to need is agaming headset so let's just go aheadand search that up now there's a lot tochoose from for sure but here is theoverall pick it is the Razer black sharkV2 X gaming headset so I think it's acollab or something like that I don'tknow but it's just a razor headset umyeah it's black meant for PC PS4 Xboxanything $38 so basically $40 but againwe don't have an option so let's justadd this to cart and uh go on to thenext thing I almost completely forgot weactually have to get a monitor I'mthinking about all like the other proofrules but yeah let's search up a gamingMonitor and just see what monitor comesup um scroll down a little bit scepterthat that's funny I actually alreadyhave this monitor so it looks like I'llbe able to save a little bit of money onthis video but yeah this is a sceptercurve 24.5 in gaming monitor up to 240HZ it says but yeah I already got it sowe're not going to add that deart yeahlet's just go ahead and uh go to thelast thing of this setup which isactually the mouse pad um I wouldn'trecommend getting one from Amazon getmine right now in the description butanyways this is for the video purposeswe're going to search up a gaming mousepad so let's see what comes up here umscroll down a little bit again and thisis a basic one it's just a steel seriesuh QC gaming mouse pad$15 um add the cart so um yeah now wehave everything in the cart right hereas you guys can see we're going toproceed to check out but I'm going to dothat off camera so yeah you guys can seeright here I'll just show you on screenthat is atotal right thereso go ahead and buy that anduh there goes my wallet I'm just goingto go ahead and wait two days for allthis stuff to come in for you guys it'llbe like 2 seconds but let's just goahead and cut to that two days later allright y'all package just came in there'sone there istwo well I can't even keep them up buthere is three and now we got to bringout the big gun so give me a secondthere wego this thing is huge all right soeverything is here we're actually goingto start off with the keyboard and mouseAmazon's Choice bundle right here gamingEssentials is what it literally saysright here um I don't know if Amazon'schoice is my choice definitely not butlet's just get this opened here we goand I'm pretty sure the mouse is stillin heresomewhere yep there it is came right outof its packaging so yeah let's see howthis feels thoughthis is going to be an interesting onefor sure first of all it doesn't helpthat I'm 68 cuz uh this mouse a littlesmall it's going to have to doregardless hopefully the keyboard is notworse than that but only one way to findout righthere all right well this is going to befun this is going to be an interestingvideo but this is the keyboard righthere you guys can see it'sliterally a membrane keyboard so it'snot going to be the best feelingkeyboard to play games on but it's goingto have to do 46,000 people bought it onAmazon and it's Amazon's choice so it'sgoing to have to be my choice for thisvideo so yeah let's just go ahead andget this headset out of here Razer Idon't think Razer can disappointhonestly plus this thing actually wasn'tthat cheap for a headset so wow theyliterally got the wires in like thesesleeves right here uh this is theheadset up close andpersonal if it would focus there therewe go you guys can see it I mean itdefinitely doesn't look bad it alsodoesn't feel bad either it's got a lotof cushion on the top you can see likethe razor thing on top there yeah let'ssee how this feels though hold on it'sdefinitely too small yeah no literallyit's like the same exact headset it's alittle bit lighter and more comfortablethan like the czor SG 500 headset yeahanyways let's go ahead and go on to theuh mouse pad super simple steel steelseries quick mouse pad right here um Idon't know how to open it I'm not goingto lie pull it out now here it is umyeah uh on the bottom of it it does havea cool little design it's like the steelseries logos but it's just a basic blackmouse pad definitely big enough for surefor a mouse like let's see how thisfeels definitely feels a little bitcheap it doesn't even have Stitch edgingon the sides but yeah I mean it doesn'tfeel that bad we're going to have to getused to it but but now it's time toactually unbox this Behemoth of acomputer that can barely fit in theframeso we're going to have to actually standup because it's too big to open up likethat okay guys literally right here Ican see that this thing came with akeyboard and it also comes with a mousebut it's buried in there I'll pull itout in a second but literally I'm prettysure this keyboard is better than theAmazon's Choice One just great Ihonestly don't know how I'm going topull this out though I'm going to haveto figure it out all right yeah there wego high IQ play right there here we goyeah and here's the mouse it was at thevery bottom right here uh right therebut yeah I'm really just trying to seethe Aesthetics of this PC right here manI will say the packaging though isactually a lot better than a lot ofcomputers that I have unboxed beforelike it's just like more premium qualitystuff but here we go finally we goteverything out of here and this is thePC right here go and swing this openthough oh about to hit me there we goyou can take this other packaging out Ihonestly kind of like the design of TheSwinging Doors just not for this videocuz like kind of stuck behind the thething here um we're going to we'reactually going to plug it in though soyou guys can see theRGB there we go turn it on just likethat it doesn't come with a RGB remote Ididn't see one anywhere so the RGB rightnow is just purple but I'm pretty surethere's a way to change that maybe eventhis button right here does that ohwould you look at that it actually doescan we go toRGB we need we need red blue and greenshere we need all of it finally I thinkwe found some type of RGB version italso has RGB right here which is prettycool but yeah we have the CPU Coolerright here we also have 16 GB of RAMit's 2 8 GB 6 you know what guys I'mjust going to switch between this andthis so you guys can see but yeah wehave the CPU Cooler right here the ryzen5 5500 CPU everything looks pretty coolit also has the RX 6400 GPU right thereas you guys can see it also comes with a500 GB SSD which is somewhere in thereand it also comes with Windows 11in there yeah overall Aesthetics of it Ithink it looks pretty good I could takeall this little plastic wrapping butit's just easy for you guys to see whenit's opened but yeah uh the only thingthat's kind of weird is like how it'slike metal right here like silver whichis I I don't know I don't know how Ifeel about that honestly but yeah italso has some packaging still under herethat I didn't get out so yeah guys Imean you guys can see uh everything butme but this is the uh full Amazon'sChoice gaming setup so we're going to goahead and uh get everything set up foryou guys and then play some games youknow see how good this PC actually isand if Amazon's choice is approved formy choice so let's go all right guys weare on the PC right now we just loadedup Minecraft we're going to be doingmultiple games for just a comparisonjust to see like how good the FPS is butyeah we are in Minecraft right now we'rejust going to go into a world I justcreated see how much fps we can actuallyget on this thing and just loaded in tothe world and right off the bat we'regetting 700 FPS doing nothing I'll showyou guys my settings it's literally thedefault settings render distance is at12 and stuff biome 5x5 this headset alsosound quality isn't bad like I can justtell like it's not like the cheap onefrom Team I was talking about earlier sosound quality is pretty good on these uhheadphones um but yeah we're going to goactually just like down into this caveand see how much fps we can get we'realready getting 1,000 and we're not evendown in the cave yet yeah let's just goall the way down here let's just go asdeep as we can go in this cave get askull torch going there we go all rightright so in the bottom of this caveright now with a skull torch we aregetting1,500 FPS you're going to be able to runsuper high quality shaders you couldprobably run like really really goodshaders on Minecraft for sure uh cuz Imean even flying around like renderingstuff out in the distance you can seewe're getting well over 300 or yeah wellover 300 now which is actually kind ofcrazy it's Minecraft though I mean youcan't be surprised it's literally one ofthe easiest games to run on a computerbut uh yeah with that being said I thinkwe're going to take it into valerantnext um we're definitely going to beplaying fortnite as well so make sureyou guys stay tuned in the video butyeah let's go ahead and go into valerantnow and just see how good this PCactually is all right guys valerant itlooks like we are getting um 230 FPS onaverage which is honestly less than Iexpected but it might oh okay it's 300around 300 that makes a little bit moresense now I'm not used to this Mountsensitivity so if you see me Miss a lotof shots that is definitely the reason Iwill say the mouse is by far the worstpart of this video it is so unergonomicshaped it's also just not a comfortableMouse like it's like the rubber on islike hard there's like actually norubber on like the grips so it's like aholding just like a piece of plastic inmy hands the keyboard honestly doesn'tlike it's membrane but it it hasn'treally given me problems mainly becausevalerant you don't really need akeyboard where you have to press a bunchof buttons so for a game that's notsuper intensive where I have to likeslap all the keys all the time it's it'snot a problem it's just a norm feelslike a normal keyboard right now itactually kind of feels satisfying I'mnot going to lie might be a bad thing tosay popped them oh shoot bro you can'tpull out your knife one time in DeathMatch all right there we go finallygetting some kills actually find somepeople oh yeah I don't know how I didn'tjust die right therejeez wow that's the worst kill ever hadin my life oh my goodness I do notdeserve to kill that guy it literallykicked us out of the game really quickso we're just going to the range uh justto play around for a second oh yeahwe'll definitely say like you can seelike I can definitely play on it noproblems at all PC is super goodhonestly I mean for a pre-built computerit's like what you expect to get for$650 like I play on some $500 gaming PCsthey usually get about 200 FPS invalerant this one's getting 300 yeah Iwonder what the Amazon's Choice gamingmouse is cuz that would probably be alot better and even the mouse that camewith this computer is way better thanthis thing right here like if you guysjust can't tell like it's poop but I'msticking to it I got to use it for thisvideo so yeah I mean you guys saw a goodamount of gameplay Val right there yeahlet's get out of here let's go to somefortnite and uh really see how thiskeyboard and mouse hold up I think thePC is going to be perfectly fine butwe're going to see how good we can playwith this keyboard and mouse we justloaded into fortnite our FPS is actuallycapped at 120 so we kind of I kind ofwas worried there for a second but asUNCA this thing330 FPS looking in the sky in Creativeum let's just build with this thing ohmy goodness oh this is bad this mouse isactually so bad dude I I don't think Ican actually use it hold on let me lockin let me just try to lockin this is actually so hard I don't Idon't even know I don't know what it isit just makes it so hard to like likehold because okay I think this is whatit is I think it's because it's plasticright here so whenever I'm holding itI'm just constantly like slipping offand then these buttons arealso these buttons are also like kind ofhard to press as well and it's just it'sjust cheap I guess I'm not going to talkabout anymore in this video if I talkabout it one more time everyone dislikeinstantly okay 20 over 200 FPS whilebuilding in Creative so we're definitelygoing to be able to get like 144 in gameso yeah let's just go ahead and takethis into a game I guess surprisinglythe keyboard's not bad looking at itit's the most basic keyboard ever butit's really not that bad it's justmembrane oh person right here oh he'sone HP got him let's go another one uphere as well he dipped he dipped back inthe house yeah one over 144 so like 180pretty much so you can have 180 HZmonitor in pubs so that's pretty good ohhello wow thisdude oh no way no he's actually on oneHP dude no waybro oh no way no way he was solow oh my gosh he was low too let's godead let's go dude oh anotherone acceptit guys maybe I lied about theseheadphones cuz I didn't hear that guy atalloh my gosh that's clutch that is clutchwe had no mats and we killed a personwith a shotgun wow we had no morereboots as well I I mean we have sixkills we're not doing bad this mouse isreally selling oh dang it I talked aboutit again I wasn't supposed to that's onme and we're getting rushed by anotherperson oh no guys this might be it Ican't I can't lie to you guys this mightbe itoh no no we're dead he had the same ideaas me to go up that stair dang it dudehe we got six kills honestly thiscomputer really isn't that bad at alllike averaging over 150 FPS in game nostutters like it's not anything likesuper bad or noticeable you guys can seeit for yourself I definitely I don'tknow I can see why it's Amazon's choicefor sure all right guys so yeah you guyssaw it honestly for an Amazon's Choicegaming setup it wasn't that badliterally the only thing I'd recommendchanging is the uh keyboard and mousebundle just get a separate keyboard andmouse um keyboard really wasn't that badbut you can just see it's like a verybasic keyboard um I mean definitelyusable but the mouse was absolutelyterrible like the whole time like myring finger was hurting like right hererubbing up against it um and yeah it'sjust not very ergonomic so not for me atleast personally the headset not too badI'd say it's like mid um and the PC fora pre-built computer probably like an 8out of 10 definitely a very good PC italso looks pretty good aestheticallylike you look in here everything lookspretty good with the RGB fans you gotthe RGB right there too it is super bigthough I will say it's like massive butit definitely performs pretty good forthe price for a pre-built computer I'malways going to recommend building onefor the price but you know if you don'twant to definitely this one is worth itbut yeah just a reminder to check out mything logic and their storage rack withthe link in the description uhdefinitely a very good way to store anyof your gaming items that you have andit also looks pretty cool on display butum yeah also check out the videos hereand here cuz YouTube recommends them andI recommend them and you're going tolike them so click on one of them rightnow but yeah nonetheless make sure youread your Bible and I'll see you guys inthe next one peace","REPLY if you see this

Congratulations! Awesome desk and set up. I was happily a part of your Halloween Sylvanas transmog themed stream ( which was amazing BTW! ). I love your entire room. So many amazing Sylvanas items! One of the few Sylvanas things i actually have like you is that awesome mousepad lol the obvious part makes it hilarious but it's really comfortable and helped with my wrist pain. Congrats again, you are doing an amazing job!!
Congratulations!
Congrats
Awesome to hear
Looks incredible! :)
Wallpaper gives me nostalgia, it used to be mine for such a long time. If you've ever considered using (and have spare pc power to do so) I know wallpaper engine has animated versions that I used for a while as well. Happy you got your new desk tho and hope you continue to enjoy streaming.
Looks amazing!! The new desk is gorgeous!!
Thank you for all your videos! Sadly been unable to play since 2016, so your vids keep me informed of content changes and also let me remember how much I love this game !! Keep them coming !
Congrats!
Great looking set up for an even greater looking gamer

don't know why I thought itwas 2 years it's literally been 3 yearsA lot has changed in my setup andthere's more changes coming up so Ifigured now is the best time to documentmy setup the way it is but I will say myPC is kind of Str ling a little bit nowI've been putting off updating my PC fora while cuz it's able to do what Ineeded to do but what finally push meover the edge was I downloaded

issueswith connectivity I have to charge itlike I'd say once every 2 weeks orsomething it lasts such a long time andI've had no issues with it yet and Ilove how it's all pink like even thebuzzling on the side the buttons are allpink I have like the second wrist restit's a little bunny I got it from likeuh wish or something and I just just puta bunch of these posters in the back cuzmy wall is really ugly and patchy and Ihave these super cute USB hubs butthey're sreo so I have a Cinema One uhmy microphone is connected to it my ringlight a keyboard is connected to it mymouse and yeah I've had this one forabout a year and it's so cute I needed aUSB hub and I have this long wrist resthere too I got it from so Kawaii it's socute it's komaromi and it's plushy butI'm too scared of getting a dirty so Ijust have her as decorationbut like look how cute she is as a wristrest and she's super comfy but I don'twant her to get dirty and then I havethis hell kitty succulent it's a fakesucculent cuz I can't take care ofplants but she's so pretty and I lovehow the strawberry is pink I'm astrawberry girl I got it from box lunchand I actually got her like discountedbecause she had this on her bow and itwas the last one in store and I think Igot her for like $3 or something I waslike yeah I'll take her and then overthis way we have my steam deck I think Ihad washi tape on it originally and Ijust didn't like how it looked so I gotthis cover on Etsy and I love it I haveto repaint the stand cuz as you can seemy painting skills suck don't look at ittoo close and I love how you can putlike a littlewallpaper onyour is it called the steam deck elatoright it's not a streamdeck stream deck it's a stream deckright oh my God I don't know what Icalled it uh don't rewind my steamdeck steam deck um but I love how youcan put a little wallpaper on it so Iput a Hello Kitty and friends one cuz ofcourse why would I not and then behindit I have the times gate from deom theyhave a pink variant now and I love it soso much it is so so pretty it's meant tobe used like a clock which would come inI should use it as a clock but I justlove displaying super cute pixel art onit on top of it I just have my smiiesthey look so cute they're just doingthese are the from the yoga series ifthere's one thing about me I'm alwaysgoing to be an RGB girl I saw Tik Toksaying like oh 2020 PC setup Tik Tok wasall about RGB lights cringe and I waslike then right next to it I have thisnew figure I got from popmart it's fromthe skull Panda the warmth series and Ipulled the all pink one and I think itjust looks perfect on my desk I lovehaving little figurines and toys andthings like that on my setup I think itjust looks so cute and right next to itI have a second USB hub this one's MyMelody I'm going to be honest I don'tknow what that connector is for I don'tknow what that's connecting it'sconnecting something but she's heremainly if I need more USB plugins andthen right next to it I have my Nintendoswitch with a really cute Paco case Itook the joycons off cuz the joycons Ihave on it wouldn't fit into the dockand then right next to it I just havethis little myy she could be wall artthe girl that sold it to me also shecould be a coaster but she's just toocute to use as a coaster and then backthere kind of hidden I have my tiltedNation headset stand with my headsetthat I use it's a yaho cat ear headsetand white it's a really good headset butI will say if I wear it for too long Iget kind of a headache right next to mydesk I have a drawer and on top of it ismy PC which is going to be changing soonI've had her since like 2019 and I don'tknow if you can hear let me stop yappingI having the hardest time runningcertain games InfinityNikki I love you Rogue but it's time foran upgrade so I've been saving up forthat and I'm so close to getting thatupgrade all set up so expect to seeanother video on that when it happens itshould be soon hopefully let me be sillyfor a moment I also just don't like howshe looks at the time when we built herI didn't have a lot of space I stilldon't but I have a little bit more spaceand I had to get a mini tower and atthat time they didn't have I couldn'tfind any cute pink Towers now there aremore options and I also don't have anylike lighting so it's just likea it look so serious and like not mystyle especially because like I said Ilove RGB lighting and pixel art and allthat I think it just stands out likelook at my setup andthen look at my setup and so I'm excitedto get a build that actually matcheswhat I want and here is the microphonethat I use the microphone and the standare both by fafine the microphone isactually a really good quality for itjust being a USB plugin go microphone soI definitely recommend it if you'relooking into getting a new microphonethat is Affordable but really goodquality I got so excited cuz I've beenwanting one of these like low profilemicrophone mounts I don't even rememberhow my old microphone stand was cuz I'vebeen wanting a low one like this for solong and F fine made an affordable oneoriginally in white so I had the whiteone and I was like a I wish it was inpink and I I checked on their Amazon afew months later and they released apink one and it is so so pretty it wasreally easy to set up and I just lovethe color pink and how it matches theirmicrophone and then on it I just put alittle Kopi cuz of course and then I putthis My Melody Dark Magician Girl thisis the one I really really wanted sowhen I got her I was like yes right uphere I have the ring light that I useduse I did have another one on this sidebut it fell down so that's the nextthing I'm also changing I'm saving up toget new ring lights cuz this one's justnot bright enough I would love theElgato key lights and then I just havesome Nano leaves I didn't have enough tomake a heart so like I made like thisface but like it looks like a JackoLantern I'm not going to lie these keptfalling off and we finally got them tostay on and it's been a few months knockon wood knock on wood that they're notgoing to fall anytime soon but uh yeahI'm not I'm not switching that I stilluse the same camera for streaming cuz itjust it look the picture looks reallygood uh but I don't like how the cameralooks like this just on its own eventhough I got this really cute likelens I don't even know what this is casefor it and it's little My Melody ears Istill didn't like how it looked so I gotthis camera case and it's supposed to belike a carrying bag so now I have likeon My Melody I don't know I I think itlooks a lot cuter that way and then Idon't like the mount that I have I hadto spray paint it I also had to like sawthis part of it cuz it was going up waytoo high I don't know the science orreasoning behind why it was going up sohigh so I just have like this randomhole here and I was like oh let me justcover itwith this little keychain I have and I'mnot a big fan of this monitor mounteither just because I'm used to havingmy two monitors like right next to eachother that's as close as I can bringthem with this Mount uh so I'm hopingwith the new pixio one I could bringthem closer together I have a keyboardwall over there but I'm not going toshow it cuz it's kind of messy maybeI'll save that for another video and Ican give yall a tour of the keyboardsthat I have in my current rotation oh Iguess I should show the chair that I usethis is the love of my life the secretlab Titan chair I love this chair Iliterally recommend it to anyone it isso so comfortable and I

The monitor is MSI MAG 271QRX QD-OLED
I switched from an IPS to an OLED about 6 months ago. It's great. The darker blacks really add alot of depth to the picture.
How are u not famous already? Ur content is absolutely amazing
Aint no way bro waterdropped into existence
I got that same monitor, really huge improvement over my previous 1080p 240hz VA one. I wouldn't want to go back to non OLED anytime soon. One of the best improvements to my setup
thanks for the daily content. I always learn something new from your videos! Keep it up!
I snag a deal on an oled during Amazon black Friday and HOLY CRAP I can't got back now. Oled is so good to look at
havent gotten an OLED yet but back in 2018 i went from a 24""1080p 60hz to a 27"" 1440p 144Hz monitor and it was the single best upgrade I've ever done next to going from an HDD to an SSD. Monitor upgrades, especially when there have been generational leaps are massive. Also reminds me when I went from a CRT TV with RCA cables to a 1080p LCD with HDMI on my PS3. Again, one of the most massive jumps in quality I've ever experienced.
Yo Sheed!!!! Love your channel. I'm happy your channel pops up very often
For people wanting a monitor for Gaming specifically, OLED is amazing but if you do any digital work where True Colour matters then IPS is the way to go.
The different way sheed pulls up is always fun to watch
to me, HDR on an oled has been the most impactful visual upgrade I’ve seen since HD TVs in the mid 2000s.
I kinda like the way the IPS looks here over the OLED
The best is when you play in the dark. It's so amazing at first that you will double check your screen is actually turned on or off. It's THAT black. Black as if it was switched off. Sooooo beautiful.
I switched from an lg 34 inch ultra wide 60hz IPS panel to the new lg 32 inch ultragear oled. And i did not like it one bit. I didnt even game on it yet. But the apps just looked washed out and dull. Whites had some kind of a tint to it regardless what preset i chose within monitor. 

When i put it in FPS mode it was decent but still not as accurate as the cheap IPS monitor. It actually hurt my eyes after two hours. Text weren’t as legible either, even at the recommended 150% display setting.
I swapped to an OLED 3 months ago. Not only were the blacks better, but the glossy panel was so much better than a matte display. It makes the image look so sharp and clean.
Your videos are amazing, loved how you used instant transmission like goku
Instant Transmission!? Subscribed.
A little FYI for anyone planning on buying the MSI Oled. The ""Panel Protect"" function is mandatory and can only be delayed by I believe 16 hours. By default it is every 4. If you do not run the pixel panel protect, the monitor will run it for you automatically. It will give you a warning to say ""We're going to run panel protect regardless of whether you press execute now or wait until later.""

It is a little annoying because this can run while you're gaming. So if you're planning on long gaming session, make sure to run panel protect first.
For people with an nvidia card and can’t afford an OLED (at least yet…) can just use the media control panel > display settings then edit the contrast vibrance and everything.

Trust me it makes a huge difference
Bro this is one of the best pc channels ive ever seen. Way to underrated
Found your channel a couple days ago, absolutely loving your content man :) Honestly hadnt thought about a monitor upgrade in a while, but would be a really enjoyable upgrade
I had 2 IPS monitors and recently added an OLED to the mix. If you boost the color on an IPS monitor, it actually makes it looks really good and the colors just pop. It wasn't a life changing event going from IPS to OLED because of that. It's still better, but if you don't want to spend the money, just boost the color
Yeah nah ima need tht back
“ Yeah nah imma need that back”
Oled was a game changer for me. I don't ever want to go back. Lol
And not a word about the annoying flickering when VRR is enabled. OLED can be as good as you want, image flickering when gaming is just an absolute deal breaker.
I got this monitor too and i love how it looks, but i hate the forced oled care soo much. I'm already using the setting where it only reminds me every 16 hours, but the timer doesn't even reset when the monitor is turned off at night and sometimes pops up while im ingame. i hope they fix this since its the only issue for me, i always have to remind myself to manually use oled care first thing when i start up my pc, so it doesnt randomly pop up at the worst moments.
im waiting for QDEL to come out as a cheaper, longer lasting alternative to OLED
Got the same one I love everyday I get to play on it
The best part of IPS to OLED is no back light bleed.
You can go to almost any display store like Best Buy or video only to see the difference.
They said oled has lower durability because of too much burn in and contrast
I have a oled 2k 360hz monitor and the difference from my old main monitor (now my second one) is insane it was an ips 2k 144hz, feeling way smoother and also the real black and colors are INSANE. and yea my monitor costs more than a 4070 x)
SAR 10.00 Donated so God can bless me to upgrade to OLED soon
The Rick and Morty art in the background is so cool, I wanna know where you got that from
I have a QD-OLED TV it's fire af
S90D
the only problem with oled is If you get one when you have multiple monitors.. You will want all of them to be oled because of the color diffrence..
oh and also the price.
Oled also can be brighter, but most cheap oled tend to have low refresh rate for gaming and likely to lack burn in protection.
I'll say this... switching from a TN panel to an IPS one was almost life-changing.
My concern with oled is longevity. I have a monitor from 2014ish, and it look just as good normal as then. It is 1080 but resolutions and response time stay consistent over long periods.
I went from a 24''LCD monitor to a 55'' OLED (LG C1 TV) monitor. It is awesome. Wandering around in RDR2 is so beautiful.
From a good mini LED, not. But from other LCD tech, absolutely worth it.
Maybe my next upgrade. Still gathering infos and opinions.
""shouldn't have to worry too much about burn in""
Yeah.. no thanks.
Just bought my Samsung 49"" OLED Monitor and am planning on buying the 57"" OLED Samsung Monitor next month for a dual wide screen setup. Been on console ny whole life, My PC era will be in full effect before the year is done
I feel like oled monitors are made for people who are already using high end gear in their setup. 
I would not really reccomend an Oled monitor to someone who is running a tight budget.
Get a good deal on an ips monitor and use the extra money to buy one or two more cheap ones for extra screen space.
I use asus tuf va panel and understand that as sometimes i see much concerned on how colors are blured in movement and feels different remember when saw emerlads in mine but in movement colors so mixed that the blurry showed it as dimonds
Oled is far beyond IPS as IPS is far beyond LED. 

-Apocalypse... maybe.
I get those weird vertical lines in certain darker/greyer areas x.x
Don't let youreself be fooled into spending money like that, IPS at 1440 is very good. Sure, Oled panels are great but it is not worth the price.
Ty!
I have Samsung Odyssey G8 oled and that's an amazing monitor
You can make ips like oled with screen dim and if you save money on oled you can get higher resolution or hz
I'm gonna upgrade to an OLED later this year, Hopefully by that point prices will go down a bit more.
I went with IPS just today as I needed neww monitor, the old one was VA so I AM getting a lot more performance and OLED is just still crazy expensive where I live. Maybe in five years.
I hate the panel protect. I was in a ranked game and had to do the refresh and couldn’t cancel. First it was every 4 hours, now I have it on 16 hours. The screen is nice, but I wouldn’t buy it again
Insane price difference is never worth it.
You can go to a building called a ""shop"" where they have things like this on display so you can see them...
Instant transmission was dope
Two years on my Alienware Aw34dwf and still happy
My friend just got a brand new PC and he use to use a 60hz monitor for his console gaming. Now he just got a MSI OLED monitor and he notices a HUGE DIFFERENCE in response time, color, and smoothness. He really loves it
My oled monitor just arrived today I got the aw2725 and I was using a g2724d up until today I had never seen an oled monitor in real life only images and holy shit. It is beautiful
I game on a pair of 40 inch 1080p60 tvs i got from FB Marketplace for 50 dollars each... I had 3, but the third one finally died after being on almost 24/7 for like 6 years straight...
Went from a 34inch va to a 34inch qd oled, no regrets.
The main and only game that runs absolutly superb and looks astounding is horizon games on my c3 especially if u do the personalized setup and prefer sharpness gosh it's so good I almost always take screenshots mid play everytime
34”UW OLED 175hz was my best upgrade in last 10 years.
My steam deck oled fd me up it’s so beautiful it’s hard to play on my tv anymore
Which IPS monitor do you use?
I was gonna get that same exact model but I went with an LG OLED monitor since it was more of a discount at the time
Its cool for sure but there are other panel types that look good too. Once you use an OLED for a month the wow factor is gone. I personally think maximizing pixel density provides the most immersive experience
48 inch LG CX OLED, 5 years old and amazing
gonna wait fr micro led monitors to b a thing
it may be better visually but dang if its not expensive. it is definitely not the norm yet and maybe in the future it can be more reachable for me. heres hoping
returned back to amazon MSI MAG 271QRX QD-OLED becouse of text fringing :))))) purple colors on the corners os apps and games.. becouse of qd oled pixels layout
well the first time that i switch to the OLED panel was like switching from a ps2 to a ps4pro and now i cant go back to the ips panels at all
I just bought my first oled after seeing one for the first time in Best Buy.
Nice Short! In the same boat, on a 1080p monitor for far too long. Wide 1440p is where I'm headed
I got an oled a few months ago. A few days ago it broke so I brought out my old one. The difference is massive.
I love the style of your presentations
If you're going to make content like this to inform people, you need to cover all aspects of what you're talking about. 

OLED looks great, but whether you should get one or not ENTIRELY depends on if you play games that leave HUD elements on your screen for long periods of time. Burn in is a real thing and I don't see you talking about it at all. Important consideration if you play MMO's

Besides, you can make your LCD monitor look better just inside of the Nvidia control panel itself. Go to Adjust desktop color settings > and set the brightness down to 50% , set contrast to 60% , and set the Digital Vibrance to 60%

You can make your colors pop more like an OLED screen without any danger of burn in. I'll wait for prices on Micro-LED to come down
I upgraded from a 34 inch (3440x1440p) IPS for my Desktop to a 16 inch (2560x1600p) OLED on my laptop and despite the size difference, the OLED is by far my favorite
Depending on model and brand OLED's are very nice to have, especially if you play a lot of triple A titles. I've been play Last of Us Part 2 on my OLED, and it looks unbelievable
I recently got the AOC Pro 45inch curved OLED Monitor and its awesome ,really makes the graphics pop out ....
I use a OLED C2 tv for gaming, avowed looks amazing on it with ray tracing
I have the LG 27"" 1440p OLED and it is too dim for me. I went back to my IPS.
I’ve owned many Oled’s over the years, the picture quality are indeed stunning! Perfect deep blacks with vibrant colours. But no matter how hard you to try to avoid it, you’ll eventually get burn in that ruins your screen completely. You can try lowering the brightness, even try using features like pixel shift. But it will just delay the inevitable. Until manufacturers figure out how to completely eliminate this issue, avoid Oled’s.
I never had a fancy monitor, i only ever had some cheap small tv that is lower than 1080p. The best screen besides a tv ive seen was a laptop screen, which looked pretty good. It was an oled, but im guessing a lower end one. I am yet to see above 70hz refresh rate, but once i can, i will be getting a good pc or laptop with a good screen
yo make a part 2 talking about refresh rates, because it doesnt matter what fps your rig can put out when the refresh rate for your monitor will always cap it to 60 fps
real talk though, if you dont have the budget for it, some regular 1440 monitors are just fine, but you will not regret getting OLED for sure.
Love your type of humor lmao
Oled variant will be 2-3x the price of an IPS monitor with the same parameters. Without a side by side comparison you won't see the difference in a home setting. If you play a lot of the same game with the same elements on screen, they will burn in eventually. If you can afford it, go with the Oled, if you're gaming on a budget then go with a quality vibrant IPS display. Most popular games these days are vibrant and colorful.
Recently switched to a HDR oled monitor, so worth it. Better investment than a new gpu.
I upgraded to 4K OLED on Sunday from a 1440p Gaming Monitor. It is a world of difference. Just absolutely tasty.
I had a legion 5 pro. I just got a Asus g16 OLED. Mannnnn it’s a night and day difference when gaming. Even just the start up when it only shows Asus logo that shit looks clean asf. If you have the money I’d always say upgrade to OLED
I got a steam deck OLED because so many gaming dads praise it saying you can game anywhere with oled 90hz screen
Guess what after many months, I still game way more on my desktop pc with ips 1440p monitor. One important reason is that the steam deck Oled cannot offer high refresh rate gaming while my 1440p 170hz monitor and rtx 4070 gpu can.
I wonder what the only disadvantage of Oled can be ?
I spend a lot of time on productivity... I'm really scared of OLED burn-in.
I’m on an OLED and I thought the right monitor was the OLED and looked better than the right. Even after you clarified, I still thought the right one looked as good or better.
you forgot the NITS bro

also stuck up these3D art panels however this literallytook me all night it was really worth itthough as I feel like they give the rooma bit of depth and even though the roomstarted to actually look good it didn'tstop me from attempting to put up ashelf before I went to bed okay um it is1: in the morning I don't know if youcan tell in my voicebut I'm really tired so I'm going tosleep and carry on in themorning now on the start of day two meand Adam started to build another deskbecause believe it or not this roomisn't going to just have two setups it'sgoing to have three I'll explain lateranyways it was time to add the rest ofthe shelves look at that like a gloveright now I'm actually combining twodifferent types of Ikea shelves to getlike this really thick shelving designis that what you would call it like alike a thick shelf I don't know I had tocut some of the shelves to make them fitbut once we had done that all thefurniture was completed which means wecould move on tolighting however not all of the stuffthat I've ordered has arrived yethowever we've still got quite a few toputup yeah we're going to fill this roomwith pretty much the craziest lightingI've ever put in any room so let's putthem[Music]in this is literally just the first oneI reckon it will look even better when Iturn theseoffoh my this is one light one light I'vegot like 10 to 15 more this is going tolook good anyways the next light to addwas this crazy desk light that I couldput all the way around the deskoh my God we've only put two lights onright now I I could stop here and itwould still look incredible this isgoing to be the best setup I've evermade I can just tell but if I actuallywant to make this the best room thatI've ever made I need to get rid of oneof the worst things about thisroom the biglight you see if I just turn off everysingle light in here and I put on thelightswitch do you see what I mean it just itjust looks horrible I genuinely thinkthis might be one of the worst thingsmankind has ever invented I mean there'sthere is a few other things obviouslybut um top three at least so one I'vegot here is a Phillips hue light switchwhich is basically the exact same thingbut it's a uh a color changing bulb so Ijust get rid of thisone I should beable to change it to different colors Ibought this ginormous lamp from Ikearight when you put on it oh waa it umyeah it doesthat oh my God just like that the roomwas completely transformed with just afew lights it's honestly giving mespaceship sort of Vibes right now but Istill want to make this room better umI'm whispering because I want to stayquiet so Emily can't hear me butrealistically um I need to make thisroom look as good as possible cuz umgenuinely this Channel's success wouldnot have happened without her like someof you may know thatI've wanted to do YouTube since I was 11years old because of Emily I am nowdoing that she's generally made mydreams come true so I just want to beable to surprise her with this likecrazy room um for her birthday I need Ineed it to be good so I'm going to workthrough the night I'm going to put upsome more lights and yeah overall I feellike we've made some very good progressfor day[Music]two hello my friends it is day three andI have currently spent around about 90%of today just waiting around for Amazon[Music]packagescheers thank you very much forthat oh my God there is so many packageslet's take these upstairs because theAmazon delivery was so late it now meansthat we've got even less time to finishthis sowe really need to getstarted more lightssoundproofing next light is in O itgenuinely just keepsgetting it just keeps getting better andbetter now there was only one more Setof Lights to put up however I might havemade a slight miscalculationI I don't have enough I'm currentlybuying some and they will arrivetomorrow it just means that I'm I'mreally cutting it close so since we'reputting Lighting on hold right now weneed to move on with some other thingsnow this room currently has a problemwhen youclap there there's a bit of an echo so Ineed to reduce that by putting up theseuh foam acoustic panels so I stuck themonto the wall and not only did it givethe wall a nice design the echo was alsomassively reduced but now let's add the[Music]monitors we have got the monitor arms onwhich now means we've got to add somemonitors to them and uh let's just say Imight have gone a little bit Overkillbecause not only do we have one monitorI didn't just get two I didn't get justthree I didn't get just four I didn'tget just five I have got us six monitorsthat is three monitors each and a a lotofelectricity rip my bank account now forpeople who love Tech the top twomonitors here are 4K 27 in monitors 144Herz and all the rest are just normal27in 1080p monitors that are going to beused for other things so let's get theseopen that is nice[Music]nice and that is the six monitor this isreally starting to come along now on areal one though it isapproaching midnight uh I know I wassuper hyped to put these monitors up butnow I just know I havegot a lot to clean up likejust look at all this rubbish man I wantto go to bed butI'm going to keep doing this forly I'mgoing to just now tidy this entire placeoffand I'll see you guys in the[Music]morning good morning everyone it is dayfour and um let's just say right now Iam getting a little bit conscious oftime becauseum not everything has all right I wastaking a walk with Emily earlier and Iasked her what is the one thing thatshe's kind of really expecting from thiswhole setup and she said as long as Iget a PC considering you gave my lastone away to a subscriber it's finelisten I'll get you a new pc it'll bethe best PC you've everseen they haven't arrived yet andEmily's birthday is in 2 days however umsome other stuff did arrive today whichis the Nano Leaf lights and some moremonitor arms so at least we've gotsomething to work on today so I startedadding the extra monitor arms and justas i f I was making someprogress okay we have a slight problemum I've realized there's not there's nota lot of like leg room here I can onlyjust barely fit in this place theproblem is I've used Too Many Alexdrawers and I've got to get rid of onewithout the entire setup collapsing ohthat nearly messed everything up I'mpretty much playing the setup equivalentof Jenga I don't like this apart from ifI mess up here Emily is not going tohave any monitors you guys have no ideahow tricky this is in the end though Imanaged it the next thing on my to-dolist is to fix the Nano Leafpanels okay the lights now should be alldone so let's plug themin yo oh myGod this this generally might be thebest setup I have honestly ever made Iam so happy right now we've only justnow completed the lighting stage so ifthat crossed off the the list we'reactually on track to finishing thisbefore Emily's birthday let me justconfigure these and we can finally TurnAll the Lights On but it's when Istarted configuring them that we hadanother problem okay we havea a serious serious problem trying toget the Nano Leaf lights to sink up tomy phone they just won't work the oneson the right here just seem to be faultyas I spent the past 3 hours trying toset them up but they just wouldn't workI even went into my garage to see ifthere was any on Leaf lights but I foundnothing basically now midnight Iliterally spentlike 7 hours trying to get them all toconnect and link up and it just won'twork I've done it hundreds of timesbefore I've been on literally everyReddit post I've been on every onlineform just trying to figure out I'm justgoing to have to um sort lighting out onthe final day then I[Music]guess it is the last day before Emily'sbirthday so I've got basically all oftoday to try and finish off this room Idon't really know if everything's goingto arrive today but judging by the waythings are going I might have to try andextend the deadline to like later in theday on her birthday but yeah we we'vegot to get started now today is the daywhere we add in basically all of thegaming setup accessories I've got somany things to add in here first thingwe're putting in is these white speakersthat match perfectly with the setup andthen we've also got these matchingWireless Logitech headphones this isprobably the most expensive setup I'vemade because everything that I have tobuy I have to buy two of them we've evengot some Led headset stands so thatthese headsets have a place to sit we'veeven got a white microphone arm to gowith a brand new sha mv7 whitemicrophone now we're not really usingthis for gaming it's going to be morefor voiceovers like the one you'rehearing now in fact this is the exactmicrophone that I'm currently speakinginto and you can probably tell I sound alot better anyway now it's time forkeyboards now for me I've gone with thislike I don't even know what it's calledH I75 I don't even know I saw itand itjust oh and it's white and blue so Ithought it would be perfect for Emily'skeyboard we're going with this pink epermaker one which I put in her last setupbut it's it's that good we've got to putit in this one and for the mouse we'regoing with the best mouse in the worldthe MX Master 3s again though I've hadto get two of these which is um uh thisvideo has been so expensive I tookanother shot of trying to fix thelighting on the wall but then I had anunexpected guest[Music]arrive oh look who decided to turn up ohM oh I missed it I missed a little bitof this haven't I just a bit yeah comeand help me out man what's your what'syour first impressions thisis so clean now remember when I saidearlier that I was building a thirdsetup we still need to add things intothat as it's currentlywell it hasn't got anything in it sowe've actually got a Mini PC that'sgoing in here nice little Keyon keyboardhypx mouse speakers and you know how Ialso said earlier that I'd got sixmonitors that was a a lie again I gotseven so that that's the seventh monitornow oh God this setup is purely going tobe used for dumping Youtube footage ontoand it's also going to be a spare setupif anyone else wants to game with us butanyways forget about that Emily's new PChas just arrived this is Emily's PC butwe actually do have another one of thesecoming the problem is I ordered thesePCS on separate dates so we do haveanother one of these coming you're justgoing to have to imagine right now thatthere is another one right here becausethere is one coming now these PCS aretough of the line I went all out on thespecs of these mainly because I did giveEmily's last PC away to a subscriber butthis thing is is better than anythingshe's ever had before these are thespecs literally it's top of the line itit cost around about three grand andwe've got two of them anyways added somefinal touches like Emily's iPad andmicrophone and I even got us some customXbox Pro controllers these things areabsolutely insane we've never played onPro controllers before but just holdingthis thing in my hands I know 100% it'sgoing to enhance our gaming experienceand of course I've got myself a matchingone for myself and as we added them itbecame midnight it literally just becameEmily's birthday anduh she's just sat there editing Emily'sactually working on a video right nowwhich we want to make when we hit 500ksubscribers which will be to open thefirst ever free gaming store for a daywe really want to make this video so hitsubscribe if you want to see that happenanyways it's time for the final[Music]day now the Kickstart off the final daywe have had a huge delivery from theguys at technically stable these guyshonestly make some of the most craziestMouse mats I've ever seen in my life Imean just look at how cool that's goingto look in the setup oh that is perfectoh yes this is probably my favoriteMouse M design I've ever seen in my lifebut whilst I was showcasing off thismouse mat I Got a notification that Ihad been waiting for this entire week ohmy God okay dpd is here okay one secondoh my God I have to pause on the mousemap because my PC ishere yeah myfriend the second PC is here let's getit upstairs yes it's great news that thesecond PC has arrived however I need tostill show you guys these Mouse matsbecause I swear down to you these areprobably some of the best designed Mousemats I've ever seen in my life I feellike a lot of the time with mouse matsyou can't really see the artwork that isactually on them because a keyboard andmouse is usually covering it I feel likethis one is one of the cleanest designsI've ever seen and I've also got it inblue but just in case we don't want togo with that we've also got this designand we've also got this design what'samazing as well is they've sent out theother color variant so we can basicallyhave matching mouse pads as wellhonestly this is not sponsored but hugethank you to technically stable forsending out these however now it wastime to bring in my PC now this was sentout by PC specialist again not sponsoredbut if you guys want to sponsor me PCspecialist then uh I like your productsI I wouldn't say no but no I I did payfor this myself and my God is it heavybut also beautiful let's do the peelokay time for the big[Music]revealoh my God look at this I've never everseen a motherboard like that this isgenuinely so cool but we still weren'tdone with ading thing the setup stillneeded some plants one can go here onecan go here one can go here one here andone here and with that the setup wasnearly

what look howtall you are I forgot you're you'resmaller and look how little I am just goon reach reach go onthis some small people problems sowhilst I took Emily for a deliciousbirthday meal Adam had to crack on andget the lights off the only problem wasoh my yeah no that's that's that's notgoing to happen I literally can't reachit happy birth toyou I've gotit once Adam had fixed the height issuehe had no problem getting the lights upoh my God they're on they've on they'reactually on now I I thought I'd brokenhalf of them with the lights finally upthe setup was now complete which isgreat

much formaking it literally the perfect setuplike ever it's all right now my birthdayis literally in s days so like you knowwhat what are you gettingme uh[Applause],"What a sick video Dantic. Feel like I've been on the adventure with you the whole time, and the whole story with your fiance makes me feel the emotion you felt while making this room. 

I've been there so many times where everything goes so smoothly, until something goes wrong and then you're 8 hours deep with still no idea how to fix it, but good on you for persevering as the lighting looks amazing, especially that pendant! Sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to reveal the problem. I'm doing the same office renovation and it's just so tiring sometimes, up till 1am either painting or moving stuff around, so I can definitely empathise with the struggles and the toll it takes on you.

You certainly deserve way more subs, and I hope you make more of these videos in the future!
Glad to see that whilst being so kind to all these people he still treats himself and his girlfriend. Keep it up Dantic I'm loving the vids!
I remember from a previous vid that she liked the white better with only touches of pink and love that it got remembered (as an icon like Dan would lol). Happy late Birthday Emily!!
Hey Dantic!
Huge fan here I'm 27 and have always been passionate about gaming. Your content really speaks to people like me who dream big but are limited by what we have. Right now, I'm stuck using a GTX 2060, only 4GB RAM, a 500GB HDD, and a 650W PSU. It barely holds up for gaming, let alone learning video editing or streaming.

One of my biggest dreams is to start a YouTube channel — something where I can finally share my love for gaming and creativity. But the setup just isn’t there, and financially, upgrading hasn’t been possible for me.

If there’s ever a time you’re helping someone level up their setup, I’d be honored to be considered. Just having someone like you even read this means a lot. Your videos don’t just entertain — they motivate people like me to keep dreaming.

Much love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Keep doing what you do, you’re genuinely making a difference
Just came across this guy for the first time, subscribed after 2 videos. Cutest gaming/YouTube couple, amazing editing that it's like being on the journey in person. Time to binge watch everything this guy has uploaded.
CA$2.00 Like the last vid, I didn't watch it yet, but ik it's gonna be fire Just got through the first minute, Happy birthday Emily!
I just recently started watching you in 2024 watching you strive for the creative artistic way gaming can come in different shapes and sizes. I love that you're bringing the inner childhood of everyone around you out with the amazing designs in gaming rooms you create with you and your teams. I hope for you to never let that fire burn in your heart bro
I just got my first pc today and your the first person to pop up on my YouTube for a pc setup and your channel is awesome definitely going to be subscribing
Santa did a low key version of this for my kiddos this year. You had to be so excited when completed. So rewarding. Keep up the fun sir
New subscriber here from the Philippines! 🇵🇭 Rooting for both of your success. I've been watching your vids for two straight days—love it!
Now this is some fire dedication to your girlfriend.... it's beautiful that you spent so much money just to make her happy..,And it's beautiful that she shows appreciates your by thanking you, it shows how much you both love each other.... Personally, this was a very good vid
You make the coolest gaming setups, every setup looks amazing, cool video
You guys are so loving, happy birthday Emily.
Yes…we are really doing this 18:27
Day 1 of asking Dantic to make me a gaming setup
This is the definition of a proper YouTube video
what an insane gaming setup / room bro!! 

Keep up the insane work!
Amazing video brother. You genuinely cooked with the setup
Crazy how in 4 months you’ve crushed your 500k sub goal?!
Loved helping with this one. I think we did a pretty good job!
08:46 awwwwww
Awmygod, that cable management is power! Let’s go overseas and see if omen will sponsor a road trip to do a amazing setup for a fan. Let’s try to get 3 likes to kickstart this crazy idea
The thought that he would actually go through all this and put up all this money just for a hug from the bottom of his sister's heart, it really brings tears to my eyes, he's just fighting to have the best relationship with his siblings, God bless my friend
Hi Dantic! I was here wen you hit 100k and now i cant believe how fast your channel is growing! I wish you and you fiance the best of luck for the future!
How does this guy always find a way to give him self a way harder challenge in every video .It’s always like a super short deadline or something
i did watch the entire thing.. no lies.. i did watch it when it came out 50 mins ago but then DINNER TIME.. GREAT VIDEO!!!

I know in the future their will be a video on Dantic buying his dream car since if he continue with videos where he has to carry large furniture he will need a better car. Prove me wrong in the future

This setup is so insane, what a satisfying video

Hey Dantic,

I know this is a lot to ask, and I don’t even know if you’ll see this, but I just wanted to try... My Ps4 is really old, and I can barely run anything on it. I watch your videos every day, and they always make me smile, even when things are tough. I’ve always dreamed of having a setup like yours, but things at home have been rough, and I can’t afford a new one.

I don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful—I just admire you so much, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you’d see this and understand how much it would mean to me. Even if you can’t help, thank you for everything you do. Your videos make my days a little easier.
Another banger I love the videos
11:50 Why do you have in your phone a Monday??
Petition for Dantic to start a gaming channel.
bro the youtube ai says the topic is no cable management
2:42 Max lével complete! Now is time to build!

lateranyways it was time to add the rest ofthe shelves look at that like a gloveright now I'm actually combining twodifferent types of Ikea shelves to getlike this really thick shelving designis that what you would call it like alike a thick shelf I don't know I had tocut some of the shelves to make them fitbut once we had done that all thefurniture was completed which means wecould move on tolighting however not all of the stuffthat I've ordered has arrived yethowever we've still got quite a few toputup yeah we're going to fill this roomwith pretty much the craziest lightingI've ever put in any room so let's putthem[Music]in this is literally just the first oneI reckon it will look even better when Iturn theseoffoh my this is one light one light I'vegot like 10 to 15 more this is going tolook good anyways the next light to addwas this crazy desk light that I couldput all the way around the deskoh my God we've only put two lights onright now I I could stop here and itwould still look incredible this isgoing to be the best setup I've evermade I can just tell but if I actuallywant to make this the best room thatI've ever made I need to get rid of oneof the worst things about thisroom the biglight you see if I just turn off everysingle light in here and I put on thelightswitch do you see what I mean it just itjust looks horrible I genuinely thinkthis might be one of the worst thingsmankind has ever invented I mean there'sthere is a few other things obviouslybut um top three at least so one I'vegot here is a Phillips hue light switchwhich is basically the exact same thingbut it's a uh a color changing bulb so Ijust get rid of thisone I should beable to change it to different colors Ibought this ginormous lamp from Ikearight when you put on it oh waa it umyeah it doesthat oh my God just like that the roomwas completely transformed with just afew lights it's honestly giving mespaceship sort of Vibes right now but Istill want to make this room better umI'm whispering because I want to stayquiet so Emily can't hear me butrealistically um I need to make thisroom look as good as possible cuz umgenuinely this Channel's success wouldnot have happened without her like someof you may know thatI've wanted to do YouTube since I was 11years old because of Emily I am nowdoing that she's generally made mydreams come true so I just want to beable to surprise her with this likecrazy room um for her birthday I need Ineed it to be good so I'm going to workthrough the night I'm going to put upsome more lights and yeah overall I feellike we've made some very good progressfor day[Music]two hello my friends it is day three andI have currently spent around about 90%of today just waiting around for Amazon[Music]packagescheers thank you very much forthat oh my God there is so many packageslet's take these upstairs because theAmazon delivery was so late it now meansthat we've got even less time to finishthis sowe really need to getstarted more lightssoundproofing next light is in O itgenuinely just keepsgetting it just keeps getting better andbetter now there was only one more Setof Lights to put up however I might havemade a slight miscalculationI I don't have enough I'm currentlybuying some and they will arrivetomorrow it just means that I'm I'mreally cutting it close so since we'reputting Lighting on hold right now weneed to move on with some other thingsnow this room currently has a problemwhen youclap there there's a bit of an echo so Ineed to reduce that by putting up theseuh foam acoustic panels so I stuck themonto the wall and not only did it givethe wall a nice design the echo was alsomassively reduced but now let's add the[Music]monitors we have got the monitor arms onwhich now means we've got to add somemonitors to them and uh let's just say Imight have gone a little bit Overkillbecause not only do we have one monitorI didn't just get two I didn't get justthree I didn't get just four I didn'tget just five I have got us six monitorsthat is three monitors each and a a lotofelectricity rip my bank account now forpeople who love Tech the top twomonitors here are 4K 27 in monitors 144Herz and all the rest are just normal27in 1080p monitors that are going to beused for other things so let's get theseopen that is nice[Music]nice and that is the six monitor this isreally starting to come along now on areal one though it isapproaching midnight uh I know I wassuper hyped to put these monitors up butnow I just know I havegot a lot to clean up likejust look at all this rubbish man I wantto go to bed butI'm going to keep doing this forly I'mgoing to just now tidy this entire placeoffand I'll see you guys in the[Music]morning good morning everyone it is dayfour and um let's just say right now Iam getting a little bit conscious oftime becauseum not everything has all right I wastaking a walk with Emily earlier and Iasked her what is the one thing thatshe's kind of really expecting from thiswhole setup and she said as long as Iget a PC considering you gave my lastone away to a subscriber it's finelisten I'll get you a new pc it'll bethe best PC you've everseen they haven't arrived yet andEmily's birthday is in 2 days however umsome other stuff did arrive today whichis the Nano Leaf lights and some moremonitor arms so at least we've gotsomething to work on today so I startedadding the extra monitor arms and justas i f I was making someprogress okay we have a slight problemum I've realized there's not there's nota lot of like leg room here I can onlyjust barely fit in this place theproblem is I've used Too Many Alexdrawers and I've got to get rid of onewithout the entire setup collapsing ohthat nearly messed everything up I'mpretty much playing the setup equivalentof Jenga I don't like this apart from ifI mess up here Emily is not going tohave any monitors you guys have no ideahow tricky this is in the end though Imanaged it the next thing on my to-dolist is to fix the Nano Leafpanels okay the lights now should be alldone so let's plug themin yo oh myGod this this generally might be thebest setup I have honestly ever made Iam so happy right now we've only justnow completed the lighting stage so ifthat crossed off the the list we'reactually on track to finishing thisbefore Emily's birthday let me justconfigure these and we can finally TurnAll the Lights On but it's when Istarted configuring them that we hadanother problem okay we havea a serious serious problem trying toget the Nano Leaf lights to sink up tomy phone they just won't work the oneson the right here just seem to be faultyas I spent the past 3 hours trying toset them up but they just wouldn't workI even went into my garage to see ifthere was any on Leaf lights but I foundnothing basically now midnight Iliterally spentlike 7 hours trying to get them all toconnect and link up and it just won'twork I've done it hundreds of timesbefore I've been on literally everyReddit post I've been on every onlineform just trying to figure out I'm justgoing to have to um sort lighting out onthe final day then I[Music]guess it is the last day before Emily'sbirthday so I've got basically all oftoday to try and finish off this room Idon't really know if everything's goingto arrive today but judging by the waythings are going I might have to try andextend the deadline to like later in theday on her birthday but yeah we we'vegot to get started now today is the daywhere we add in basically all of thegaming setup accessories I've got somany things to add in here first thingwe're putting in is these white speakersthat match perfectly with the setup andthen we've also got these matchingWireless Logitech headphones this isprobably the most expensive setup I'vemade because everything that I have tobuy I have to buy two of them we've evengot some Led headset stands so thatthese headsets have a place to sit we'veeven got a white microphone arm to gowith a brand new sha mv7 whitemicrophone now we're not really usingthis for gaming it's going to be morefor voiceovers like the one you'rehearing now in fact this is the exactmicrophone that I'm currently speakinginto and you can probably tell I sound alot better anyway now it's time forkeyboards now for me I've gone with thislike I don't even know what it's calledH I75 I don't even know I saw itand itjust oh and it's white and blue so Ithought it would be perfect for Emily'skeyboard we're going with this pink epermaker one which I put in her last setupbut it's it's that good we've got to putit in this one and for the mouse we'regoing with the best mouse in the worldthe MX Master 3s again though I've hadto get two of these which is um uh thisvideo has been so expensive I tookanother shot of trying to fix thelighting on the wall but then I had anunexpected guest[Music]arrive oh look who decided to turn up ohM oh I missed it I missed a little bitof this haven't I just a bit yeah comeand help me out man what's your what'syour first impressions thisis so clean now remember when I saidearlier that I was building a thirdsetup we still need to add things intothat as it's currentlywell it hasn't got anything in it sowe've actually got a Mini PC that'sgoing in here nice little Keyon keyboardhypx mouse speakers and you know how Ialso said earlier that I'd got sixmonitors that was a a lie again I gotseven so that that's the seventh monitornow oh God this setup is purely going tobe used for dumping Youtube footage ontoand it's also going to be a spare setupif anyone else wants to game with us butanyways forget about that Emily's new PChas just arrived this is Emily's PC butwe actually do have another one of thesecoming the problem is I ordered thesePCS on separate dates so we do haveanother one of these coming you're justgoing to have to imagine right now thatthere is another one right here becausethere is one coming now these PCS aretough of the line I went all out on thespecs of these mainly because I did giveEmily's last PC away to a subscriber butthis thing is is better than anythingshe's ever had before these are thespecs literally it's top of the line itit cost around about three grand andwe've got two of them anyways added somefinal touches like Emily's iPad andmicrophone and I even got us some customXbox Pro controllers these things areabsolutely insane we've never played onPro controllers before but just holdingthis thing in my hands I know 100% it'sgoing to enhance our gaming experienceand of course I've got myself a matchingone for myself and as we added them itbecame midnight it literally just becameEmily's birthday anduh she's just sat there editing Emily'sactually working on a video right nowwhich we want to make when we hit 500ksubscribers which will be to open thefirst ever free gaming store for a daywe really want to make this video so hitsubscribe if you want to see that happenanyways it's time for the final[Music]day

Mousemats I've ever seen in my life I feellike a lot of the time with mouse matsyou can't really see the artwork that isactually on them because a keyboard andmouse is usually covering it I feel likethis one is one of the cleanest designsI've ever seen and I've also got it inblue but just in case we don't want togo with that we've also got this designand we've also got this design what'samazing as well is they've sent out theother color variant so we can basicallyhave matching mouse pads as wellhonestly this is not sponsored but hugethank you to technically stable forsending

much formaking it literally the perfect setuplike ever it's all right now my birthdayis literally in s days so like you knowwhat what are you gettingme uh[Applause],"What a sick video Dantic. Feel like I've been on the adventure with you the whole time, and the whole story with your fiance makes me feel the emotion you felt while making this room. 

I've been there so many times where everything goes so smoothly, until something goes wrong and then you're 8 hours deep with still no idea how to fix it, but good on you for persevering as the lighting looks amazing, especially that pendant! Sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to reveal the problem. I'm doing the same office renovation and it's just so tiring sometimes, up till 1am either painting or moving stuff around, so I can definitely empathise with the struggles and the toll it takes on you.

You certainly deserve way more subs, and I hope you make more of these videos in the future!
Glad to see that whilst being so kind to all these people he still treats himself and his girlfriend. Keep it up Dantic I'm loving the vids!
I remember from a previous vid that she liked the white better with only touches of pink and love that it got remembered (as an icon like Dan would lol). Happy late Birthday Emily!!
Hey Dantic!
Huge fan here I'm 27 and have always been passionate about gaming. Your content really speaks to people like me who dream big but are limited by what we have. Right now, I'm stuck using a GTX 2060, only 4GB RAM, a 500GB HDD, and a 650W PSU. It barely holds up for gaming, let alone learning video editing or streaming.

One of my biggest dreams is to start a YouTube channel — something where I can finally share my love for gaming and creativity. But the setup just isn’t there, and financially, upgrading hasn’t been possible for me.

If there’s ever a time you’re helping someone level up their setup, I’d be honored to be considered. Just having someone like you even read this means a lot. Your videos don’t just entertain — they motivate people like me to keep dreaming.

Much love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Keep doing what you do, you’re genuinely making a difference
Just came across this guy for the first time, subscribed after 2 videos. Cutest gaming/YouTube couple, amazing editing that it's like being on the journey in person. Time to binge watch everything this guy has uploaded.
CA$2.00 Like the last vid, I didn't watch it yet, but ik it's gonna be fire Just got through the first minute, Happy birthday Emily!
I just recently started watching you in 2024 watching you strive for the creative artistic way gaming can come in different shapes and sizes. I love that you're bringing the inner childhood of everyone around you out with the amazing designs in gaming rooms you create with you and your teams. I hope for you to never let that fire burn in your heart bro
I just got my first pc today and your the first person to pop up on my YouTube for a pc setup and your channel is awesome definitely going to be subscribing
Santa did a low key version of this for my kiddos this year. You had to be so excited when completed. So rewarding. Keep up the fun sir
New subscriber here from the Philippines! 🇵🇭 Rooting for both of your success. I've been watching your vids for two straight days—love it!
Now this is some fire dedication to your girlfriend.... it's beautiful that you spent so much money just to make her happy..,And it's beautiful that she shows appreciates your by thanking you, it shows how much you both love each other.... Personally, this was a very good vid
Day 1 of asking Dantic to make me a gaming setup
You make the coolest gaming setups, every setup looks amazing, cool video
You guys are so loving, happy birthday Emily.
Yes…we are really doing this 18:27
Crazy how in 4 months you’ve crushed your 500k sub goal?!
This is the definition of a proper YouTube video
what an insane gaming setup / room bro!! 

Keep up the insane work!
Amazing video brother. You genuinely cooked with the setup
The thought that he would actually go through all this and put up all this money just for a hug from the bottom of his sister's heart, it really brings tears to my eyes, he's just fighting to have the best relationship with his siblings, God bless my friend
Loved helping with this one. I think we did a pretty good job!
08:46 awwwwww
Awmygod, that cable management is power! Let’s go overseas and see if omen will sponsor a road trip to do a amazing setup for a fan. Let’s try to get 3 likes to kickstart this crazy idea

Hi Dantic! I was here wen you hit 100k and now i cant believe how fast your channel is growing! I wish you and you fiance the best of luck for the future!
How does this guy always find a way to give him self a way harder challenge in every video .It’s always like a super short deadline or something
i did watch the entire thing.. no lies.. i did watch it when it came out 50 mins ago but then DINNER TIME.. GREAT VIDEO!!!

0:10 ""Its not the best"" Yeah bro its an empty room ️
I wish I had someone like her, she's really my dream girl, but Emily seems nice too, congrats to you both
WHY NO CABLE MANAGEMENT????????????????????

Electricity bill
This setup is so insane, what a satisfying video
Hey Dantic,

I know this is a lot to ask, and I don’t even know if you’ll see this, but I just wanted to try... My Ps4 is really old, and I can barely run anything on it. I watch your videos every day, and they always make me smile, even when things are tough. I’ve always dreamed of having a setup like yours, but things at home have been rough, and I can’t afford a new one.

I don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful—I just admire you so much, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you’d see this and understand how much it would mean to me. Even if you can’t help, thank you for everything you do. Your videos make my days a little easier.
Another banger I love the videos
Petition for Dantic to start a gaming channel.

Hi Dantic, I'm Lenny Bryan, and I watch your videos from Africa, more precisely in Gabon. 

I wanted to tell you that I find your videos truly fascinating, being a gamer myself who dreams of having rooms like the ones you build in your videos. Honestly, I'm a big fan of your work, and I will continue to follow you and like what you do because it's remarkable. Thank you for making me happy by investing so much in what you do... 

I really hope to meet you one day, even though I'm so far away...

You are simply the best gaming YouTuber, you have always been an inspiration to me, but I don't have the money to have a dream PC, you need to gain more popularity because you deserve it. I've been watching your videos since he started and I like them all!! I'm Portuguese from Portugal! Dantic 
Could you make my dream of having a dream PC come true?

I need a gaming setup so badly that I am taking notes for 3 years watching this gaming setup duilds
For the ceiling you could get a star heaven.
I absolutely love watching your videos because you actually make the ultimate setups everyone else isn’t so good at it
That single hanging bulb made the room look like a torcher scene in a movie, you just had to add a chair beneath it.
That's very good
IKEA is manufactured in Türkiye. They manufacture the highest quality furniture in the world. You are very lucky to use IKEA. Enjoy your gaming system. Good luck. Greetings from Turkey.
1:55 ayooooooo
Сделал подарок ей и себя не обделил, молодец какой
When Dantic's cousin comes over and Dantic's mom asks him to let his cousin use ""that game thingy"", he asks ""Which one?""
Missing a way to block the lights coming in through the window and some cable management, other than that... the setup is awesome!

Flexing rolex submariner
yeah yeah it seems you have it all....but do you have a porn collection
Always flexing like a stupid child. 
Grow up man. 
First you pick the comment and the try to show off 
Stupid
What about your Rolex
If u have a Pokémon illustrater I will believe u have everything in the world
Btw nice rolex...
Bro. Dont mind them.
Nah bros flexing the submariner
Causual rolex
His flexing game IS strong
I also have that Rolex Submariner
kinda dissapointed i thought you will wear different watch every time u showed a cheap one
Rolex black submariner shining! man! what a flex! haha
To be very honest, owning a couple of Rolexes is very very very very common in Asia.
Bro literally just had his own Rolex which can be around more than $50k
Because your broke
Bro have a Rolex and a sieko watch box .......
But never show off
I like pokemon watch .
Let's just forget about the Rolex that he is wearing
entire time flexing rolex
Bro has Rolex submariner
How to flex Rolex ...be humble....
you are this rich but i bet you dont have bracelet collection
And he is wearing a ROLEX while showing his collection nic3 brooo
But you dont have a camera collection and an antique radio collection
you guys have watch collections? damn I need to make some money quick
You're Kapampangan (based on your accent and the flexing).
“I don’t work” is a bigger flex than that Rolex
“Tell me you own Submariner without telling me you own a Submariner!” ️
Our boi Flexin his cheap watches.. Wearin his Rolie Submariner
i love this dude with his fucking rolex lmfao i love these videos
Dino has a watch collection, it ain't cheap!!!

Bro called me a brokie in every way
He comment by himself using his other account to show off cheap stuff
Bro is showing something else

His computer is maxed out 
His monitor is maxed out 
His credit card is maxed out
CARTERPCS ACTUALLY MAKING A VIDEO ON PCS??? IMPOSSIBLE!
That view though
""It has erectile disfunction"" me too dude, me too...
cant wait for 6090 to come out eventually
carter is living up to his channel name finally
How dare YouTube hide this from me for 11 seconds
that view is great, imagine it starts raining when youre gaming... Damn
such a sick setup with the view out the window <3
singleplayer story games are accctually really nice on the large one
can you max out the thug shake stat pls
“It’s too big”
proceeds to just add another monitor
Monitor's been sitting in that closet like Springtrap in the hidden room
We need rainbolt to find your location from this video
Sometimes I wonder how you made it to 19 years old without dying
His setup is absolutely insane. Goals.
Bro got 10,000 FPS
Thats actually a pretty nice location as well to game on. When you want to get your mind of the game for a bit just checking out the view is nice.
Accidently Slips on his Gaming Setup, Falls down 14 Floors
Omg that lg ultragear oled 45 inch monitor looks amazing.
The wonky hat says it all lol
putting the big monitor on top is genuinely insane
That view is so good
that monitor is MASSIVE!!
How is that monitor too big to game on? I literally have a 45 inch ultrawide monitor and it is amazing
The question is… who is the camera man
Wish I had these problems :]
Bro finally hired a cameraman
the one dude on youtube with a 5090 who actually deserves it
Bro looking the shattered soldier at the end is so subtlety funny
Your so rich and so humble wowwwwwwww so humble wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwowowowowow
Carterpcs actually making a video about pcs
Can you do another video on the AI situation with deepseek?
His setup is ridiculously awesome. Major goals.
Great match congrats
""its got erectile disfuntion"" got me on the floor
The view is insane, its amazing that you can see the whole city while gaming
Bro's taking in clash of clans terms xD
Downscale a 1440p crt, you can get like 120+ hz in 1080p and 60 in 1440
If the 24"" 480hz monitor is at 1080p,it could be great for Esports titles or possibly any other game at max settings without the need of DLSS, especially for such resolution.
Who’s the camera man
Clean setup especially with the nice view. It must look even better at night.
can i have the old one i have a all in 1 dell computer and i get 60 to 70 fps in valorant
I just play on a 42” 4k/120 Sony tv. But I also don’t really play competitive pc games
Please Carter pcs I’m still asking for your old pc
Bro is in another universe
that acully good
That monitor is just chilling is his closet
Rare footage of caterspcs actually talking about PCs
What is that monitor stand it is so good
Bro that monitor is MASSIVE…
CHAT HES MAKING A VIDEO ABOUT PC'S AND NOT RIDING APPLES DIH
Pls can haz old setup?
the posture will be amazing
Putting the monitor on upside down is the most Carter thing ever. Nathans power bank is still haunting you Carter, beware. ️
bro just has a 480 hz monitor in his closet
I’m still waiting for my pc Carter
If its an oled monitor its already good enough
""It has erectile dysfunction"" was so random
thats kinda overkill
bro casually has a 27"" 480Hz monitor in his closet
We need the ultra wide…
“they finally look good” that’s chaotic neutral at best
Companies think this is what the average consumer looks like.
Bro just had this monitor in his closet
We have a new RTX Gpu before GTA 6
Bro casually has a 480 hertz monitor in his closet
How do you game behind an open video? Cant even imagine how uncomfortable it would be to look at get some curtains how hard is it
Dude I put my 45” upside down too! Was a pain installing solo on a 0-gravity. It’s all good now
Heard you get an fps boost if you do the thug shake
Now get a wooting 80he
bro ur young to be a tech king good on you bro
Fun fact for the Allen wrench, you can use your thumb on the short arm for a faster screw.
Day 5 of asking Carter for a pc
But cater can it run a video of you doing the tug shaker
Can it run doom?
so we aint getting carter doing the thug shake, now lets get monitor 1 and 2 doing the thug shake!!!
Collab with BennyBennion1
Plug it in while on for better performance
Bro got the batman cave setup
YEAH THE CORVETTE SWEATSHIRT
all this just for him to grind minecraft
Even though his gaming table like ‘meh’ like me, still his room with very nice scenery and pc gaming like
the setups lovely 
time to play 2ds and 3ds games on it
Carter doing work
i cant even think how any1 would game on smt smaller than 27 inches , 27 and 32 are the sweet spots imo
it actually looks sick
that view is all we need
Him leaning over to place the monitor down that close to those big as s windows that high up kinda scared me
Honestly surprised he’s using 1440p rather than 4K. Not that 1440p is bad or anything, it’s just that if he puts together a “maxed out” PC like he says, he could definitely run games at 4K and I feel like he wouldn’t be fully utilizing the power of his build
What are you playing on the first part
Oh ye back with another good vid
The parking outside is crazy
Well I say a 15k$ graphics card you got that hmmm
480hz on competitive games with DLSS4 
LATENCY WILL BE INSANE
What’s the resolution
where can I get one?
Finally a real monitor
But can it run minesweeper?
I subscribed
w
Man Carter just flexing now
Wrestling with the monitors is crazy
An hour and not 2 years I could cry
What is the curved monitor name?
The bezels
Why monitor arms are you using?!
cant wait for 100090 RTX deluxe premium
Getting ready for GTA six
So basically we been watching the prologue/prelude of CarterPCs and we finally got to the part where the plot twist happens
Combine 2 pcs
“it’s got erectile dysfunction” i was not expecting that from carter lol tf
RIP the table
Rare footage of lil bro’s actual PC content
im still waiting to get cash to build something glorious like this
Bro your view is amazing
Omg hi
His computer is maxed out 
His monitor is maxed out 
His credit card is maxed out 
his beard is maxed out
Just wait until his electrical bill comes in
Dude tighten the spring tension in that top one they have a screw to change that so it doesn't fall down I can tell it's resting on that other display
The monitor set up dawg
Carter please review the Samsung 3-D monitor
The way everyone supports each other here is insane! I feel like we’re all playing together in real time
WHEN DID CARTER GROW A BEARD GODDAMN
master Oogway- ""the only ting you need to max out now is yourself""
bro casually has a 480hz monitor in his closet and im still stuck on a 60hz office monitor
Not the Apple Vision Pro sitting in the closet forgotten lmao
bros sagging
i would use the big boy for gaming
If I would have this kind of view I would play without monitor
CARTER I EXPECTED MORE FROM U, WHERE TF IS THE 4K, 240HZ, 0.03 MS MONITOR AT?????
Cater has 26in
bros throwing away a 1440p monitor while i can't even afford a ps5
Haha I thought I was the only one going crazy but everyone else was in the same boat talking strategies and tips for every over
Bro just pulled out beast out of his closet
how u got a 5090??/
Wait for that 4k 540 hz monitor to release
Hi
“Maxed out gaming pc” bro talks like it’s a video game
The tournaments are great because you are competing against people worldwide Adds to the thrill
this might be the best monitor setup oat
Bro is rich
you need the monitor from ""the kids in the back"" meme
""its got erectile disfunction dude"" is my new favourite clip
Early 













CARTER THUG SHAKEEEEE
Bro is not escaping the rich kid allegations
He found the infinite money glitch
holy shit he made a pc related video
It looks like a 3DS without the buttons, joystick, and the internal components. Oh and 100x larger.
bro has a crazy monitor chilling on a blanket in his closet
Bro decided to go with the t-flip orientation.
Who's recording Carter...
Now put Teo of the long ones on the sides of it
I NEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mans went from a Oled to a TN monitor....
that’s such a nice view wow
alright. He basically DDNS himself, the view outside is from an apartment
400hz 5090 and still on gold on everygame is crazy dude
""45 inches is too big to game on""
meanwhile my 49"" monitor:
Same
CARTER YOU ARE NEVER. EVER. EVER BEATING THE RICH ALLEGATIONS
Imagine needing all at, I have that 1660Ti + 21in 75hz
I have that samsung g9 odyssey 49"" 5120x1440p with almost the same pixel density of a 4k.
Its extremely immersive! Best purchase!
Especially for flying games like star citizen with a nice tobii eye tracker!
Are we all just gonna ignore the fact that someone else was holding the camera for him and moving it around at some point?
Next video: “ Soooo I might now have a 720 hertz monitor”
Bros missing the two side monitors
Crazy a vid on pc lol still tho gotta love carter
He’s a big fan watched you every day
Im personally not excited for the 5090, I just dont like AI being used to account for missing firepower. As a supplementary bonus, maybe, but imma stick with the 4060 I have
""45 inches too big to game on"". Me literally gaming on 43 inch non ultra wide monitor.
and im here rockin the 60hz from around 2008 whit a Geforce gtx 980ti
Bros got the Nintendo DS monitors
Carters boxers>>> carters tech content
Says “its to big” proceeds to it bigger
One guy really said cater.
4 minutes later
the curved suppose to be main monitor and then the 480 should be on the side vertically my opinion
just a reminder the bigger the screen THE WORST IT LOOKS, use lose so much ppi
Make a pc that has the best of the best hardware along with everything that can be added to make it better with as much of everything that can be added so you can run the most demanding games with maxed graphics with atleast 300 fps

years later and I spent over $50,000 on gaming setups and today I'm reacting to a 100 of the best gaming setups from my Discord to inspire and motivate you I'm not only going to be reacting though I'll be raing every single person and giving tips and tricks so you can start improving your setup ASAP this is honestly the video I wish I had 12 years ago because my setup would have gotten so much better a lot faster and I don't want you to make this same mistakes I did so let's go ahead and get started with setup number one this is Smitty Mason setup okay okay 15 years old from Texas already an amazing setup for 15 he streams on YouTube and he's a high school student that's great as well love the peripherals here his main game is fortnite that's awesome I love everything in the setup so far his old setup was just a Chromebook that's kind of a come up though I can't even lie that's a come up inspiration for his setup is to never stop or settle that's cool I love this room dude just the room in general the lights coming down the wall goie lights up here the aesthetic the panels the lighting in between all of that's amazing it gets it earnings from YouTube and Creator code Revenue dang okay he bought a setup from Creator code revenue on fortnite he started building my setup in June 2020 okay so he's went from 2020 to now they started building this when he was 13 so basically content and live streaming is what he uses it for but looking at the setup I love everything I mean from the cable management to the usefulness of every single part of the desk he's used on everything is in a has its place it's beautiful looking like just like the cable management as well is managed very well I just love like the whole aesthetic I think personally this is like a 9 or a 9.5 out of 10 I really enjoy the aesthetic of this I think the aesthetic is what sets it up for me and then not to mention all how clean his cable management is it's great this is Archie's setup I love this already he's 15 years old from England man a lot of 15year olds in the setup in the setup video holy he makes Tech talk content okay his main game is Call of Duty and this PC looks insane also love the keyboard love the accents as well very setups on Tik Tok inspired him to build his he's a setup for gaming editing and graphic design really really talented kid um he got his first setup in 2017 and he's been upgrading it since he built a setup using birthday money and work he built a setup with some help from his dad okay understandable you're 15 I love this aesthetic looking at it like this I love the double stack here I think you did a great job with this kind of Vibe here I also love the GOI Glide and the Nan leaves up the side I think it adds a really nice aesthetic also like you got you know dual chargers for both mice I think that's kind of elite and then I also love your PC aesthetic the keyboard mouse combo I love how it's like I think this is maybe a 75 kind of similar to mine got the frro love the accents love the the mouse too if I were looking at it just by itself I would probably rate this like an eight but knowing that he has cable management and everything as well like cable management is kind of bad in the setup uh i' probably go like a 7.5 but yeah oh yeah but I love this setup I love the Aesthetics I think the only thing that needs to be better is his cable management the next setup is by Ryan okay he's 17-year-old from Texas okay he's a CFA manager I don't even know what that means um it's previous setup was just an Xbox and a single monitor so he's kind of on the come up he's got a PC now um he built a setup from editing pictures plus videos for school and gaming cool that's cool cool job photography work and video work is awesome I built this first PC in June 202 to okay so he's kind of been upgrading since 2022 that's also I love the personality in the room as well he's inspired by seeing amazing setups online and wanted to replicate it awesome uh he built the setup using uh the money working as a CFA I've been slowly building this setup since I built my PC so he probably built his PC in June and he's been upgrading over time so looking at the setup as a whole I think he did a great job with the aesthetic the only thing I would say is maybe move this PC a little further back if you need longer cables then you know extend those cables but yeah I also love the p board on the left side I didn't talk much about this but I like how you stored everything here I like how you did like everything in the in the different jars and how you started hanging up stuff I think that's really cool also you know since he's a subscriber on YouTube he's definitely a winner you can see first place right there so if you subscribe on YouTube You're a winner um but yeah also the cable manager looks pretty good for what you got also love the backgrounds too I think you did a great job with that as well I would probably rate this like a like an eight honestly it's actually really well put together so the next setup is by Braden uh he's from Veron shees he currently mows Lawns okay his main games are 5m and rust his old setup was just an Xbox and a monitor so he's on the come up here he built the setup around a year ago I would say that the leg room is not enough in my opinion uh his mom and his dad helped me build this setup okay cool um took about 3 hours to build it all in total I plans on upgrading the PC specs in the future okay yeah definitely needed the one thing I'd really say about this setup is you don't really have much leg room but I honestly would have went legs instead of elra here just because you don't have a lot of room I would just say also go for his 60% to kind of save some more room but I definitely think taking the Alex short out putting two more legs and everything would be the goal here just because again like your PC overall not a bad setup I'd probably rate it a 6 out of 10 all right moving on to the next one Sicilian I hope I said your name right the cilian setup they are 13 years old from Dublin Ireland really clean all right let's take a look the main game is war zone 2 okay he built a setup a year ago a year and a half ago during Co okay W the room looks insanely nice uh setup took about 6 months to build okay W um his old setup was a PS4 and an old monitor so he's kind of upgraded a lot from there uh he built a setup using his birthday and Christmas money which is cool so he's kind of upgraded during birthdays Christmases and stuff that's awesome and then his dad helped him build the entire setup which I really like this space bar by the way that's really cool on this keyboard I mainly use my setup for school and gaming so um yeah the one thing I notied right off of the rip was there was no mouse pad right um just because I run a mouse pad business you know like that's the first thing I noticed I don't know if this applies to everybody but for some reason that's like the first thing I noticed when I walk into a setup I think mouse pad number one you got to get a mouse pad two I would say to mount this monitor on the wall since the stand has a really round like it's really round um and it kind of like blocks off your keyboard more I'd say if you can mount this to the wall I would mount it to the wall PC and the le le uh mini love it love this AIO the way you built it in here the black and white aesthetic very very clean uh you did a great job building your PC on top of that I love the the room and the shelves and everything and the aesthetic you got going on look really good for 13 this is an insane setup love the painted wall behind the monitor I think it adds so much more than you think cable management is great as well I also love how you did headphone hangers here on the right for both your headphones really clean keyboard and mouse combo really solid as well I love this setup I think it's it's really really clean like just the room the athetic everything so I would probably rate it an8 out of 10 all right the next setup is by scoop he's 25 years old from England okay okay um he's an active duty Air Force oh that's cool um he mainly uses a setup for streaming and editing so thank you for your service as well that's awesome that he streams and everything that's pretty cool uh he has a dual PC set up for streaming okay all right love to see it I started building my setup September 2020 dude I love how you have the Dual mouse pad this is cool bro uh taking about 2 and 1/2 years to build it all that's really cool uh I was inspired by gutsy M K and teur awesome um he'd like to get a fourth monitor um and upgrade his lighting a little bit more such an insane setup so much personality the double mouse pad with the keyboard tray that matches the desk is wild that's such a unique thing I've never seen anybody do the mini a mini version of my mouse pad of the same one and bought the same that's so sick in my opinion the only thing I would say for this is the cable management for sure you know it could be a little better I also love all the personality in the background the Lego Thor the Lego Hogwarts the the fridge all the paintings on the wall everything like this is just a really nice like aesthetically pleasing setup for sure so I'd probably rate it at 9.5 out of 10 I I really love the aesthetic and you get another point for me using both mouse pads I think that's so sick the next one is by Scott Scott is a 9-year-old out of Scotland okay okay he's a setup for watching YouTube and Discord we're getting a lot of 9-year-old setups now his old setup was a laptop and was super ugly okay so he's kind of like upgraded since then I started building a setup in December 202 too built the setup using his birthday money that's pretty that's a that's a w his parents helped me build most of it that's cool I love the aesthetic man so there's not a whole lot to the setup honestly it looks really solid for what you have looks like a you got a pre-built there for a 9-year-old setup pretty freaking clean say probably a I'd probably say a seven yeah it's probably good but yeah I love this setup I think it looks really clean and the Aesthetics really nice for you know 9 years old this is Michael's setup I think this is the last setup of the day I'm 15 years old from tarnell Poland okay he's in middle school and he plays Cod and Valor as his main games um his old setup was an Xbox One S and a TV okay that's kind of a huge update though um he started building his setup uh in the 2020 during Co okay that's kind of a w um he's inspired by gutsy and heur I used my setup mainly for school and gaming okay built a setup by doing chores and birthday money okay yeah it looks pretty clean I love the the shelves the the all the boxes you're using the Lego baby Yoda um all the personality there as well K management honestly pretty solid gaming PC could use some work Intel stock fan could use some work for sure also love the wallpapers and all the foam you put around it I think it adds such a nice like aesthetic as well I think personally I'd probably rate it I'm going to go an eight no I'm going to go a seven seven out of 10 I think it looks good this is Adam a 14-year-old student out of Ireland his main game is Rainbow Six Siege and cod Modern Warfare 2 previous setup was just a PS4 and a TV what inspired him to build his current setup is Vermax me and Tech Source so thank you for that he built a setup for gaming watching videos and he built the setup in Christmas 2022 it took him around a year and a half to build it all he afforded it set up by birthdays Christmases and working around the house so look at out it I mean the pictures aren't the best so I'm going to go with my gut here and kind of just go with what I have it's honestly not bad I think the biggest thing it's very chill run- the-middle setup and I do like that you've got like the figurines and you're starting to build the personality like I can tell like you like Marvel and uh Spider-Man then you like you know Star Wars and stuff like that I think the little Lego guy is kind of cute but yeah I think overall it's super clean kill management is not bad could be a little better but you know what you did what you could P that Graphics card's got to go I don't know how that thing's alive and how you're running three monitors off that GPU I don't know how you're doing it I I just don't so yeah the main thing I would invest in is a new GPU 100% overall the setup's not bad the personality is decent K manion's decent as well and I'd probably rate this a solid seven out of 10 this is Eric an 18-year-old out of Kansas his main game is Apex Legends and his previous setup was just a corner desk with one Monitor and a PS4 but inspired him to build this current setup now is watching Esports players play in their setups and the Simplicity of optimum Tech setup he built this setup for schoolwork streaming and GTA with friends he started building the setup in 2021 did most of it in 2022 and then did the final upgrades in 2023 it took him around 3 years total to build this entire setup he afforded this setup through earning money by working on his grandmother's Farm working at a dog boarding Ranch and his graduation money he got the PC with his college account his grandmother set up do people actually play like this there's no shot right I mean c management is great the foundation isn't bad star Forge PC so oh this is the first time I've seen one okay this is definitely a typical asmin gold viewer look at bro's keyboard layout yeah bro that that's crazy you definitely should buy a rug I mean it's not a it's not a bad setup I think you do need to add more personality I I would honestly take down these Foams they ain't doing so yeah I would take them down I'd put something better on the walls maybe some more you know some more posters stuff like that but the monitor is crazy I mean me personally I don't I would never play this way I think the the mic would have been better maybe above the monitor like right here like somewhere right here put the this further back and then put it over the top of the monitor overall I'd probably rate this a solid uh a Solid 5 out of 10 next up is Gabe a 15-year-old student out of Washington his main games are fortnite and Rocket league and his previous setup was just an Xbox and so he's kind of upgraded a lot since then what inspired him to build his current setup is to play with his brother and he built the setup for his PC he built the setup in 2023 and it took him around 2 months to build everything here he also afforded this setup by working hard looking at this setup I mean it's pretty clean you know I actually like the the 18x 16 Miami swirl I think it fits so well in this setup nice a really nice monitor also I I think it's like more of like an Esports ready type of setup you know honestly I really like it I think the only thing so one thing that's holding the setup back I think is personality I mean if you look at the whole setup I feel like there's not a whole lot going on I think it's just like very runof-the-mill but it's also very clean too so it's not it's not like he did a bad job it's more like he just needs to add to it and that'll come with time but overall I think the the aesthetic like the the color aesthetic you're going for good I would keep on this path you're on overall I really like it the thing you know you could Mount this PO ship I don't know how big that is so I don't know if that's even mountable but I would try to at least clean up the cables a little bit maybe go down the leg or something like that and over but overall it's not bad yeah he definitely should have uh invested most of the money into the setup stuff like you know um like in the PC the monitor the peripherals like get that exactly where you want and then improve the Aesthetics to it as well maybe a second monitor could help a monitor mount too the desk that's one thick gas power break that's what I'm saying that thing's probably going to power him on for a week and a half if it goes offline but um I give this is probably a solid 6.5 I think it I mean it's not like crazy but it's also really nice some mouse pads in the setups in this video are my own company guts.com so if you like what you see check out in the description down below and let's get back to the video next up is Ralph a 12-year-old from Virginia his main game is fortnite his previous setup Was An Old Brown desk a Nintendo switch and a small small TV so he's upgraded a lot since then what inspired to build his current setup is Tech Source me and low he built the setup for gaming and maybe consecration in the future he built the setup for gaming and maybe consecration in the future he started building the setup in May and it's taken him around 3 or 4 months now to build this setup he afforded this setup by doing chores around the house and helping his family and his dad also helped him build the setup so that he wouldn't break anything in the process so looking at the whole setup I mean the the wies got to get some help for sure it's an Xbox setup so I didn't really expect much I was kind of looking for the PC if I'm honest it's not bad for a console setup I think the set the desk fits this console setup very well but if you were to upgrade to a PC it's probably not going to be you might need a bigger desk if you want to upgrade to your PC cuz like you might be able to fit one here but it might be like kind of tough keyboard and mouse is nice budget one the speakers are kind of cool looking instead of putting the the power strip here I would have ran one cable up and then mounted it on the bottom of the desk instead instead of here and yeah overall it's not bad um I just think it needs a little bit more organization of cables so looking at this though I mean the personality is there like a lot of figurines across the whole desk and setup uh plants there you know a lot of aesthetic there the clock on the wall with the little Spider-Man guy yeah I'd R probably a a solid I'm going to go solid six actually I'm going to go solid six out of 10 this is Raphael a 13-year-old out of Montreal Canada and his main games are CSO and Forza Horizon 5 his previous setup was just a PS4 so it looks like he's upgraded a lot since then already but inspired into build this current setup is me and Tech Source he built the setup for gaming and to live his passions he started building this setup at the very beginning of Corona virus damn long time ago this setup took him around 2 years to finalize his dream setup he afforded this gaming setup with his party money and the money he makes by cutting grass and who helped him build this setup is his dad ooh coming off of a coming off of a like a low-key setup to a banger look at that okay I do actually like the aesthetic of having like things that you do on the walls I've seen a lot of people who like you know like this is really chill to me I think this is cool in my opinion I really like the aesthetic he's going for like kind of encapsulating the monitors with the the skateboards and then you know the bonsai tree over here I think that's cool with the light and the mic placement is good good personality yeah you got a little race Sim below when he wants to use it that's pretty cool too PC looks clean I think that's really really dope and the whole room looks like a Vibe it looks like a Vibe dude the little Bing bag in in the in the corner I think it's actually not bad and then also I like how like you kind of scattered the personality throughout I think you did a great job with your aesthetic and what you're going for kale man's not bad also I would have recommended maybe putting a Raceway in front of this um but looking at the setup on the front I love how you did like the little light bar up top Solid I would say this like a solid eight next up is TJ a 15-year-old out of New York his main games are valerant and fortnite and he's a student and he also plays basketball his previous setup was a really tacky and cluttered setup and now it's getting better and who inspired to build his current setup is his brother which is really cool I think he started building the setup around 2 to 3 years ago and it's taken him around 6 months to a year to build it all now and he afforded the setup by working a job and also his parents helped him from time to time take a look [Music] oo I mean hey there's a lot of Personality it's not necessarily in the setup it's more it's more in the room like you can see in the far top right corner like there's a bunch of album covers and stuff like that that he maybe Drew or made and he's got like shoes and I'm assuming there's a shelf more on the other side of the room but the room looks really really clean from this angle also I think you did a great job with like just making it a really solid foundation two monitors PC keyboard mouse controller if you need it speaker if you need it you know very Rune Mill really clean very chill also I like that I saw I saw the $100 bill rug on the bottom dude um and this is his PC it's a little outdated for sure I don't know if this is supposed to be oh no it's a 1660 TI uh going back to the setup though I think it's dope I think he did a great job really love love the setup yeah overall I'd probably rate this a solid 7.5 out of 10 he's 14 and he's from the UK his main game is fortnite he was on Xbox One and an old TV before this and now he saved up for a PC and he afforded this by mowing his neighbors Lawns for a year and a half uh here's his main stuff he uses and he plans to get a high to mid-range PC in the future and sort out my cable management so looking at the setup I mean it's a laptop setup for sure I do like how you set up the laptop here I think this is very unique for sure having the monitor on the side and then the main monitor is better because it's like better herts or whatever this is pretty good but the cable management is really really bad on top of that this desk is a little scary like look at how you're balancing this like and then over here it's like way in the front like it's just thrown together and like I definitely would say to get a new countertop or try to fix this and make it look a little less like that it's funny that you spent money on the Nan lease when you need a PC you know I feel like those are expensive like I feel like those are things that come after unless you were gifted it but yeah interesting enough I mean the keyboard and mouse combo is not terrible completely honest I'll give it like a Solid 4 and a half I think the only thing that sets this setup apart from others is the way you mounted this monitors like the way you did your laptop and your monitors but everything else just needs work so I'd recommend I'd recommend doing that this is Astro setup he's a 15-year-old twitch streamer that also plays soccer and local Academy he's from Sweden uh his main game is sea of Thieves fortnite Minecraft and he built this setup to play video games study and have fun with his friends it took him around 3 years to save up uh working at his dad's place to reach the goal he built everything by himself except for the shelves that my dad helped me build and he used to play Xbox One S for 4 years until he switched and he wanted to spice up some stuff I really like the aesthetic you're going for I like that you put the GOI Glide above the shelves I like how you put the plants like kind of hiding the shelves and stuff like that also really like um the the PS5 controller stand I think that's really cool gaming PC if I'm completely honest I know you put on the floor cuz you thought you didn't have enough room but I think it would have looked better right here on the desk am I tripping to think that but oh why does it go like that um but I think it would looked better on the desk right there um looking at your modders and stuff really nice I like the lighting around the room too really clean heal mansion's okay I mean it's got a it's got a tray on it own so it's not a huge deal but yeah I think this PC on the desk would actually look pretty good maybe I'm tripping on that but I think it would look good there and I think you should also Mount get a Vivo Mount and mount your your monitor that way it's like floating um and then you won't have these bubbles in your in your mouse pad you know I think personality wise it's a solid seven setup itself wise I feel like there's a few things it could organize but overall this is really solid I I get you know what I'll give it I'll give it a 7.5 this is remedy setup he's a 13-year-old that is from from Florida he makes cool YouTube videos and FPS games and survival games interesting his main his main games he plays is valerant Minecraft Russ Call of Duty Black Ops 1 um he built a setup to have a nice time with his friends cousins and play video games okay it took him around 3 to four years to get everything after he got the laptop and he's been adding to it since here are some of the things he uses in his setup and he afforded the setup by collecting money for birthdays chores and getting stuff for Christmas dad and his brother helped him build his setup and yeah so looking at the setup I wish I would have seen more around the room I'm being completely honest with you yeah I would if I if I'm being completely honest I feel like there's a lot of stuff you can do with this setup I think you need monitor mounts for sure I think you need a bigger desk if possible like a thicker desk not just like this carbon fiber one and then I also recommend maybe putting your drawing tablet somewhere else problem is you have this drawing P tablet on the desk and it's not really useful you should make a thing where you just pull out the cable and you plug it in when you need it also cable management is kind of bad I would recommend some raceways as well but the drawing tablet's cool I just think you need some more room and you don't have not a lot of setup room to do this also um I think the mic placement is really bad as well um I'd recommend a boom arm if you can but there's zero personality in this to be fair what do you guys think chat 4 out of 10 a lot of people are saying four out of 10 I'm going to I'm going to give it a solid like there's really not a whole lot to go off of and I feel bad but I would probably give him I probably give him a solid I'm going to go a solid four this is Drake he's 13 and he got inspired by you and texor to build the setup he uses a setup for school work gaming and he plays fortnite Call of Duty rocket league and valerant and he raised money through Christmas money and his dad helped him build the setup love the pro Ron sticker shees dude he's got the he's got 34 out of 50 dude yo yo see this is an OG viewer of mine for show cuz I did this if you are a newer viewer to me that's okay but I did this in 2021 I went up to the warehouse and I signed like uh 50 mouse pads and I and I made them a gold colorway and that we've never released any of them ever again it's a it's literally one of a kind like there's there's literally and they're numbered I like the theme a lot I think the only thing you could really improve on here is just more personality in the setup but you're already doing such a good job here with like the shelves and the lights and the the the hoops right here and then your cable management scene's pretty decent from what I can tell extra points for being an OG for real I hey the streets are saying it's a 10 but in my opinion I I think it's like a solid eight this is Frank he's a 19-year-old uh college student from Puerto Rico his main games are valerant and Minecraft and he built the setup for gaming studying and the first time he submitted his setup was a year ago in episode 19 and now I'm here and upgrade it with my setup which took me a whole year and 2 months to build and he got his first PC 8 months ago okay awesome yeah but look at this man I mean this is beautiful I like the double monitor setup KO management is actually really nice really solid foundation love how you came manag behind the PC as well yeah really nice Cable Management I agree mic placement is good too monitor placement is decent mouse pad rooms great C man's very good so in my opinion","please put time stamps on your videos. i can't sift through 4 hours ever. thanks, from eveyrone.
Before I even watch the video I just wanted to say I'm final seriously saving up for my dream setup, I've always been really really bad with saving but I just can't go without a setup anymore. What really pushed me sadly is one of my long time friends who is also pretty broke just got their setup so I gotta get mine now too
14:35 we heard you the first time
Yo Wsg bro I just want to say you have inspired me so much and I love your channel bro,keep it up
Hope these kids know how lucky they are to have the opportunity to have such set ups.. I’m 25 next month and have never had the space where I’ve lived to have a set up like this, always been a console/tv player from my bed it’s been a dream for me to eventually get a set up like those shown. But I don’t think it will ever happen, it just seems so expensive to play games at a high quality. I have a ps5 and an xbox series x but don’t own a 4k tv
I’m not broke, I’m 13.
I have a few recommendations for your setup.If you have some extra money buy all OLED monitors because some of your monitors do not look the same and make it look distorted
27:22 you know what else is massive. THE LOW TAPER FADE!!!!!!!

I already have a gaming setup, and I think it’s pretty decent for being the first one. But I use the desk that I used for like 5 years for drawing and doing homework, and it sucks. I’m getting a new mic and FINALLY, Ikm probably getting a GPU too. I’m happy of having this life :D

that's totally okay because like I said earlier he built this whole setup and he's got a really solid foundation so once you have the foundation you can start to like sprinkle in the sauce you know what I mean if you don't have the foundation there's like levels to it if you don't have the foundation you're not going to be able to build the Empire you know what I mean overall I would rate this a solid seven out of 10 I really do enjoy it I think it has a really solid foundation but I do think that thinks it's a little higher but I think it's like seven it could use some more personality for sure this is Sam he's a 13-year-old from Canada still a student but he acquired his setup through progressing adding in the two years of building the setup from either birthdays or Christmas gifts that's how he's kind of acquired everything in the setup he used to play games like valerant uh or more in my years sadly have stopped though due to for him and tiredness okay buddy bro is tired uh for he's kind of just built the setup uh as creatively as he can and he always makes he always wants to improve and make new ideas he wanted to build a setup to relax and enjoy his time example watching anime or movies and he did everything by himself here are some of the things he uses in his setup and let's take a look at the images you know what's crazy about this though it's so minimal and it's nice wait I really like the idea of being able to play on one side and then just move it and watch something and like lean back you know I really like that idea cuz like you can see like here he can put it off to the side and like watch something and lean back in his chair I think that's pretty cool really really chill setup for 13 I mean this is really nice most setups you see what like at 13 you know they have like kind of everything everywhere they don't have it organized but this is like minimal functional nice it's not over the top the only thing I would really recommend is like more personality throughout the room probably but this is really chill also W Demon Slayer yeah I can't really think of what I could build more what more I could give you for advice I couldn't tell you really to get a second monitor because you like to move it around I would recommend a second monitor in the future I would give this a solid six out of 10 or seven out of 10 I think I'm going to probably butcher his name but jumar jumar he is 32 his occupation is a private driver he is located in Abu Dhabi and his main game is valerant his previous setup was just a normal laptop setup and what inspired him to build this current setup is he's seen a lot of setup videos on YouTube he built a setup for just gaming and watching YouTube plain and simple as that he built a setup in June of 2022 it took him about 2 months or so to build this setup he fored it by his salary making you know being a private driver and on top of that he just built him set his setup himself and he doesn't have any future plans to upgrade it he just loves his uh he just loves his setup the way it is let's go ahead and check it out right off the rip we have this really cool pink and blue and white aesthetic that we've got going on with some you know the black accent stuff like that chair looks massive I think it's just because of the picture but overall we just already off the bat this cable management is on a whole another level I mean look at this he's got the USB hub here he's got two pencil drawers got the the raceways beautiful KO management the way that he built this out is awesome he also plugged in the subwoofer at the bottom behind the leg and down which is so sick and then here's the top side of the desk he's got this Mount here for his monitors got that mic on the right side and also it looks like he has a uh a mixer or something like that on the desk um and then I also love the symmetry of this the PC looks beautiful the gemetry looks beautiful like everything is on point this is beautiful thank you so much for submitting such an insane setup man you guys can submit and then you guys will probably be on the episode just make sure you follow the directions to a t so he is 14 years old he's a student he's located in Hong Kong his main game is mainly Hitman 2 or Euro Truck Simulator which is interesting his previous setup was just a laptop and it did its job he needs to get another monitor sooner or later and he wants to slowly up upgrade the laptop only setup since he pulled the trigger on a monitor and desktop during the summer of 2022 what inspired him to build his current setup is uh mostly texor setup Wars and his Discord server as well of your own reactor setups which was mine thank you I got many helpful tips there and a lot of inspiration which helped me ship my setup it took him about a year or so but it was definitely worth it for him and he afforded it by working jobs with his parents and slowly saving up a allowance so we're rocking a one one monitor ultrawide setup I love this view already though wow what a view that's nice looking there's oh and this is the set the uh laptop setup he was saying that he wanted to upgrade okay this line on the wall I don't know how you did this but it looks so nice um also his cable management it's great underneath we got the cable ties underneath mounted to the bottom of the desk and all the cables are mounted there as well as a little Hub here for his Mouse plugins and you know SD cards and whatever looks amazing everything fits well and and just the aesthetic of this wall with the the paintings and stuff like that incredible job for a 14 y old setup this is really clean so I would definitely say that this is a solid seven I would give this beautiful setup I love the view I love the ultra wide I love the wall and the way you did this aesthetically pleasing it's great and thank you for submitting man the next person up is Daniel he is 14 right off the rip amazing color scheme pops like crazy he is a student out of England his main game is valerant and his old setup was previously just his mom's Old Mac and what inspired him to build his current setup is is he started watching a lot of YouTube videos about gaming PCs and stuff like that including my amazing content which that is what he actually said thank you he built his setup back in August of 2022 which only was only like a month ago he got all his money from doing jobs uh and reselling stuff on eBay and some birthday money I'd love to look into your setup man I love this aesthetic already so let's go take a look so I love this wall even though like it seems kind of like like old art like this it just great for a budget setup like you called it in the in the the notes this is beautiful I love the way that the lights are fused on the desk I like the monitor the aesthetic from the pink and blues they really pop on top of that your K management is like really great I also love the way that you built this desk and the time the space you used it in I don't really have much to say about it I love the aesthetic I love the way it looks and yeah there's not really much advice I would give looks awesome so we're going to go ahead and move on to the next setup um we're going to go on to Alias Alias is a 14-year-old out of Norway he's in school so he doesn't have an occupation his main game is valerant and his previous setup was a stack vertical setup which I've never seen But inspired to build your current setup I wanted a clean setup where I can get some natural light and what did you build your setup for my gaming uh for game with my friends and have a little place where I can escape everything he started building a setup back in 2018 and now it took about 4 years to get to where he's at now how did you afford your setup helping helping at a home for my or at my grand family his future plans for the setup is he wants to get a third monitor again but I'm holding myself to this layout and I'm probably getting some more plants for the setup off the rip we've got got this beautiful blue on white colorway for the entire setup the way that he set up his monitors the lighting the shelving all of this is this is great so far keyboard mouse combo gr Pro super light and a regular keyboard but this PC looks good too overall this aesthetic and the way that he built this for 14 years old this is beautiful the aesthetic is great I love how the plant comes down with the monitor I love the Shelf the way he showed some of your personality up there man this is beautiful from what I see right here I would say it's probably a solid 7 7.5 yeah looks great thank you so much for submitting let's go on to the next setup okay the F this is Juan he is 13 years old and he goes to school obviously his main game is Apex Legends and he's from the United States his previous setup was a Nintendo switch and just a monitor what inspired him to build his current setup his setup Wars um 6 months ago he started his building the setup and it honestly took him about 20 days to keep upgrading he afforded his setup by saving up and doing some side Hustle and his uncle helped build his setup with him and his future plans for his setup is to upgrade it to where he has more upgrades for the physical parts of his setup like monitors PC love the I love the aesthetic we're going for this pink and blue I'm seeing this a lot between people's setups recently I like the pink and blue and I love this Lighting in this setup I think it like lights up pretty nice but the desk orientation is interesting like you've got your PC to the left right and you have your monitor on this right side this lighting behind the Shelf looks great somehow I don't know how you did this but that looks great also like that the top of the setup is pink and I like the bottom setup blue I think it gives this really interesting aspect to the depth of the setup and that's cool and then his cable management is decent for the most part it's like he mounted he made an attempt he's 13 this is a beautiful setup for 13 for 13 years old I would probably say this is a 7 out of 7.5 out of 10 I really like this setup I think for 13 years old I love the aesthetic you've got going with it so moving on to the next setup this is Leo he's got a nature theme setup which chat I think you guys will like this one this one is Leo's setup he is 15 years old and he's a student in Italy his main game is rocket league and his previous setup was very very minimal with the Taxi theme setup so was like yellow and stuff like that before upgrading this uh the setup in the summer he had a yellow themed setup and he didn't have a TV but he stacked a monitor layout and he recently upgraded to the LG C2 which he loves it what inspired him to build his current setup is he built a setup with his friends and schoolwork he found out about setup related videos on YouTube and ever since he's been binging them and wanting to upgrade his own setup he used the setup for photo editing and video editing as well and some school workor and some light gaming as well he built the setup over the summer and it took about 3 to 4 months to get his setup exactly how he wanted it in total though it took him about 3 years to just get everything that he has in his setup he afforded a setup by saving up and as well he's planning to get a better audio setup as well all right Hill Mansion looking awesome looking beautiful already this is looking sick man these these pictures dude these are beautiful pictures so off the rip I just love this setup the from the lighting to the plants to the way that he set this up the aesthetic absolutely stunning I love the wall grain like the the way that this looks on the wall the shelves match the desk exactly it showcases his talent in video editing and and photography he's got some of his lenses stuff like that this is amazing it just gives this shock value I I would rate this probably a 9.5 out of 10 thank you so much for submitting this Leo awesome awesome the next one is Tim he is 13 years old out of New York and his occupation is school in trading stocks his main game is Call of Duty and his previous setup was just kind of bad so he wanted to upgrade it what inspired him to build his current setup is moving to New York and wanting to have a nice setup and he combined these two things he built a setup for gaming and productivity and he built this setup about a month ago it took him about 1 month and uh a week to get everything exactly how he wanted it um he afforded a setup uh when he bought a lot of GrubHub stock during the co and it skyrocketed making me enough money to sell off the stock and buy the setup now that's insane I can't lie that's kind of cool the only future plan he has is to buy a gutsy aen mouse pad so I really appreciate that so cool that's awesome that you sold stocks to get this set up that's cool I was really excited to see this cuz like you can see like underneath his desk is floating in the air you know so I was like that's really cool so I would really recommend to try to space some stuff out or like rearrange the room a little bit so you could make out more room but I would would love to see like an ultra white and then you just have a nice ass view look it probably looks insane during the morning but I love that you have this white black and wood theme going on which I would love to see more of I just want to see an ultra wide setup that is very clean and minimal but overall really clean and I think you've done a great job I really love that it's on a highrise setup and I love your story as well that you sold the stocks to get your PC in your setup so I think that's really cool I'm impressed I'm impressed what do you guys think nine 10 out 10 he's 13 yes this video is sponsored by guts.com my own mous Pad Company some of the setups in this video use our mouse pads so if you like what you see use the link down in the description to get one for yourself now back to the video this is Drew he is 13 years old and his occupation is a Roblox Dev and mowing lawns he's located in Texas and his main game is Rainbow Six Siege Cod fortnite Roblox Forza and Madden 23 his previous setup which is an HP office laptop and $5 Mouse which obviously this is a huge upgrade since then his main Inspirations to build the setup is me Tech Source and Casp which is dope um he built a setup for gaming SL schoolwork and he built the setup in 2022 it took him about 2 years to build this entire setup uh his future plans to build um his setup is to order a brand new CPU motherboard and a liquid cooler so yeah this is super cool at 13 this is pretty insane so this is really really clean let's take a look through the setup I mean I love the the orientation of the monitor monitors I think that's super cool the PC case is awesome as well I've never seen like dots like this with a light that's so cool I've never seen that in some sort of case like this and then here's the cable management I would have liked to see a little bit more organization I love that you uh mounted your power shrip but I would have liked to see like a actual Raceway with this organized but overall though love the theme and aesthetic I love that you put the wall panels up and the lighting on the wall panels looks actually really solid 8.5 I agree um so this is Blake's setup he is 14 years old out of Australia his main game is rust what inspired him to build his current gaming setup is me and texor so I appreciate that um he built a setup for gaming and he built the setup in January 1st this year so dang this is pretty new it took him about 5 years to save up and also build his setup and then he afforded his setup by saving up money he found on the ground and what he saved up for Christmases and birthdays for 5 years dang money found on the ground bro bro must have found like thousands of dollars on the ground or something that's crazy his next upgrade is he wants a larger mouse pad and a webcam to start streaming for for 14 years old this is really great I'm already looking at this going this is nice on top of that I love like the wood with these white peripherals I think it's great they give the mouse order by the way but I do love how the blank wall and the lighting behind the monitor gives this really nice glow and it makes the setup look really great these white peripherals with the with the the natural light coming in I love it I also like the hints of blue too I think this is great I also like yeah the case looks really clean too I think that's l the same PC case as my gaming PC I think that's the NZXT H5 flow love the peripherals um I love how you know he's kind of turned them to blue white and kept the aesthetic throughout the whole setup and I love the hints of wood too yeah could use some under desolo I agree that shair is on Live support though bro Jesus dude that chair is falling apart I think overall I would rate this an eight out of 10 this is Al aliia I think that's how you say her name she is 14 years old her occupation is Drop Shipping uh they are located out of Israel and their main game is Minecraft and Beaman Drive uh what inspired her to build her current setup is Tech Source they built their gaming setup for gaming and work they built their setup in 2021 and it took them about 2 years to build their entire setup they afforded their setup by saving money and saving money and also my parents money to buy certain things for me and they did it themselves that's awesome so let's take a look at the setup I mean already off the bat this is looking super clean I love the uh the PC as as well I love how much RGB is in the PC the peripheral is looking super nice as well kale Management's looking really tidy under here as well I like how each cables kind of like where it's going is uh you know cable tied which is really well really well done there the PC is one of the coolest things I've seen though I don't know what these RGB cubes are like a rectangles or what are they what are they called I don't even know what you call these but it makes the PC look insane very minimal um I would have liked to see the lights diffused on the bottom there there or just like on the bottom of the desk instead like I'm I'm really impressed with the color scheme I really like it overall I love the setup I think it's a great solid foundation seven seven yeah I I would say this is a solid seven Alby he is 15 years old out of England and his main games are fortnite and Rocket League uh his previous setup was pretty bad he says and when inspired him to build his current setup is everyone on Tik Tok so he built the setup for gaming and schoolwork and he built the setup over about a month ago um it took him about 3 weeks to build the whole thing and he afforded his setup by Christmases birthdays and working around his house who helped him build a setup and why and no one really helped him out to build the setup he did it on his own and he wanted it a clean space for himself let's take a look here's his PC looking like a little rough there looking like a little budget build here not too bad for the most part this is a really solid build right here I love the Skylight right above your setup I think that adds so much nice lighting into your room like into your setup everything else though I love the color theme the idea you're going for I love the Skylight I think there could be so many cool things you could do with this overall though what do you guys think about the setup I like the peg board on the left I wish you would have showed more of the room so I could see but I love the painted wall with the white I think it makes the setup Pop I would love to see more cable management and a little bit more personality put throughout the setup but I love this Skylight I think it adds so much personality super super cool yeah I I could probably rate it like a solid six the next setup is Trevor now he is 19 years old and he's a Salesman out of North Carolina his main game is fortnite Call of Duty and scary games on Steam his previous setup was just a coffee table table and he used to sit on the ground and play the keyboard and mouse on his knees which is that's kind of crazy I used to do that too uh what inspired him to build his current setup is YouTubers like me Casp and slush and he's built the setup for gaming and entertainment he built the setup in October 2022 and it took him about overall 4 years to save up and build this entire setup the monitors and stuff like that kind of unique layout double Ultra wides up on one up top one curved on the bottom it's really uh it's really interesting I've never seen someone really pull it off very well but it overall though it's not a bad setup I just think it needs some more reorganization with the kill management with the orientation of the monitors stuff like that color scheme is there yeah it's probably like a six I agree this is the Gin the Jin such hard names to pronounce sometimes y' y are crazy he's a 14-year-old from the Netherlands okay he just set up to play games and watch YouTube plus anime anime kind of w I wonder what anime uh his main game is Minecraft okay uh his first setup was a laptop and wasn't meant for gaming so he's kind of like upgraded since then uh he buil he started building a setup in June 2020 and yeah it took him about 4 months to get it get it to this point where it's at right now uh he built it by selling Lego and delivering newspaper U he wants to rearrange his uh monitors and upgrade his gpus I really love what he did here I mean these Funko Pops aren't the most expensive right you know like they're not like insane collectors idea uh you know items and stuff like that but I think he did a great job with designing the room with what he had and same with like the Shelf too he kind of put like the boxes and the plants and like all the decorations are really really nice as well hardworking guy for 14 years old I mean this is a beautiful setup and I mean his PC looks really nice for what specs it has it seems like like uh he said he wants to upgrade his GPU so he knows that the GPU is a little bit whack but everything else seems really highly speed for the most part pretty Banger setup to start up with you know the only thing is bro didn't bro didn't activate Windows hey maybe if you win the $100 you'll be able to you'll get Windows from it yeah I mean it's a it's a really solid setup for 14 I think chat's really right on the nose with that I think an eight out of 10 would be like perfect with the setup okay this is Maddy Maddie setup uh he's 14 years old from Texas okay uh he's a student and uses his setup for csgo uh his old setup was a laptop and horrible and had horrible monitors okay uh I was inspired by get aen and other Tik tokers to build my current set up thank you bro that's so awesome uh he built a set up with my money and as well as my parents money um and it took him about 2 to 3 years to build it where it's at now he built a setup all by himself which is cool and he's currently building a new pc right now yeah I love the shelf and the Nano Le like going up the side yeah I I love to see like this type of stuff where you put a little bit of personality in your room with a little tiny shelf I would have liked to seen like a longer shelf cuz I feel like it's kind of out of place you know it's not symmetrical or anything or you could have just Center entered this shelf with the monitor I think you did a great job with that personality in the setup too having like the little shelf to the right side is cool as well and for this to be a laptop setup this is awesome I think you did a great job with your KO management I appreciate you supporting the brand as well also like the little plants you kind of added throughout the entire setup and you know it's a console SL uh laptop setup so it's great love the monitor layout too I think you did a great job with that I would probably rate this a solid seven I love the personality and where he's headed I just think the cemetry and there's like a little few things with it they kind of throw it off like you know the the Shelf just isn't like very centered random clock in the middle of nowhere you know like those little things is kind of like I don't know they just throw it off for me a little bit but overall the setup is great I think you did a great job so uh this is Gran he's a 14-year-old out of Toronto Canada uh he's a streamer and mainly plays fortnite and valerant he started uh building this setup in January 2023 took him around 1 month to put it all together uh I inspired by Jake low gutsy and C uh he mainly uses it for streaming gaming and home he built it by streaming and using his birthday money to complete the setup you like to upgrade his case and as well as his GPU I really love the wall behind I think this is one of the the most insane parts of your setup is the wall plus the couch plus this I think that's so insane beautiful setup I love where you mounted your camera too I think it's great I mean I would personally I think for what he's done Cable Management wise personality wise and everything like just in his room as well it's a Vibe I would probably say it's a solid 8 .5 out of 10 just because the only reason I wouldn't give it like anything higher is just there's a lot of like little things like the monitors for me um the there's just like little things like that where it to me just seems out of place like the Kil manin 2o Kil manin is decent but yeah overall I would say it's an 8.5 out of 10 beautiful setup and let's go on to the next one this one is Evan uh he's a 12-year-old student uh their main game is valerant and Sons of the forest his old setup is a single Monitor and a horrible keyboard and mouse and he's upgraded lot then it seems like also running a fif fine mic he started building uh his setup last month I use it for gaming school and watching YouTube my dad helped me build my setup I build my setup using birthday money and Christmas you'd like to be a conent Creator one day and make a living from me that's cool only thing I would recommend is p off the carpet like PC off the carpet insta that can really affect your power supply and since it's on carpet it could ruin some parts inside but I love your mic placement the monitor is massive on the left what in the hell is this big ass monitor doing like that is a massive monitor bro that's like holy crap Bro Look at that like that is huge but I also love that you put the hexagon panels and these panels so what I would say is like I like your symmetry the clock I would say almost hang on this wall for his age he's 12 years old beautiful setup but overall I would say headphone hanger Cable Management fix the tile in the back take the PC off carpet and I think you have a solid setup um now I would probably rate this a solid 6.5 out of 10 cat's saying seven but I would say 6.5 this is Cash's setup he 15 years years old from Georgia and his main games are valerant and War Zone uh mainly use uh his setup for gaming and schoolwork and his old setup was horrible and a plastic table it's taken him around 3 and 1/2 years to get to the setup where it is now um and he built the setup using the money working for my dad he's inspired by me and other consecrators to build this setup so I appreciate you I'm glad I can inspire you he wants to basically make this setup more minimal than this off of the bat I love this PC I think he did a great job with the thermal take case I haven't seen a lot of people will be successful at making this like an actual nice case I love the desk I think the desk is almost custom made no it kind of looks custom made but you did a great job whatever desk this is looks custom made and it it looks great overall I do love what you've kind of done I mean you custom desk P looks great nice little budget setup I I think you done a great job in my opinion I I think he's done a pretty good job of being minimal and also getting his needs for valant and gaming out of the way as and for 15 beautiful beautiful setup man beautiful setup yeah seven honest ly is a pretty good rating I I think it I think seven fits seven doesn't does fit as well this is Grant setup he's 11 years old from Minnesota holy budget setup uses for for school workor and gaming cool uh his main game is fortnite it has taken him around a month to build this entire setup okay uh he's inspired to build it uh by gutsy aen and texor I appreciate it bro uh he built the setup using his Christmas money and chore money okay he would like to get a new monitor in the future man for 11 years old I can't complain this is beautiful man like this is very very very very like minimal like there is nothing to it it is keyboard mouse laptop and then some panels on the wall and some lighting if I'm not mistaken this is a laptop that has like one of those like reverse screens where you can like turn it around I think that's so genius I think that is like one of the most genius things I've seen someone do is put the laptops upside down and have the screen like flip up that way you could use it like this with a keyboard and mouse that is genius and this is what I mean about budget like you know everybody's budget are different but it's how creative you are within that budget right like look at how creative he is he's 11 years old and he doesn't have a PC or anything he has a laptop right he legitimately flipped his laptop the other way so it could have better Cooling and he could see everything on the screen like that's beautiful I would personally say this is a solid like six cuz there's really not much to it but 11 years old this is crazy and he actually took the time to Cable manage it too like some of the other setups didn't even take the time the cable manage it like this the next setup is Buck he's a 13-year-old from Tennessee he a setup for gaming school and YouTube uh his main game is fortnite uh his old setup had a horrible L day L-shaped desk and was super tight around the corners uh he was inspired by to build a setup by me he started building a setup uh a few days ago nah uh it took him a couple days to put it together that's cool he's on the grind grind use Christmas money birthday money to build it all of it that's cool personality wise beautiful setup I mean beautiful like look at the the color scheme on the keyboard to the mouse the mouse house pad you know to the Funko Pops lights in the room like it's kind of chill no personality wise you were killing it I think you did a great job like building personality without spending that much money thank you for submitting uh I think it's going to be a solid seven for me this is Bentley setup here he's a 13-year-old from United States he uses a setup for gaming and watching YouTube looks like it's a laptop setup with an Xbox I think his main game is war zone love the keyboard and mouse combo he started building a setup 3 months ago and it took him about a week to build his dad has helped him build this setup as well uh he built the setup using christas and birthday money so it's a console laptop setup that's clean uh he lik to paint his room white and a new desk and look how nice this is for a console and laptop setup like I wish I would have seen more you know also I love the color of the desk I think the color of the desk really makes the setup pop but for the most part though you did a really great job I mean I love this setup I think the everything you built was great thank you Bley for submitting we're going to be going down to

Allen setup they are 14 years old and they their occupation is doing chores for my parents and siblings they're located in the United States and their main game is OverWatch uh their previous setup was my dad's old laptop on a corner desk and what inspired him to build this current setup now is me and other people he saw on Tik Tok he built the setup for school in gaming and is he built a setup around this Christmas it took him about a few years to get everything to actually save up for everything and build it a custom keyboard knockoff goby Glides Ikea pegboard G8 mouse pad and Ikea desk with a school laptop it's pretty cool and his future plans for the setup is to Cable manage and add more storage to their PC so I love the mouse pad thank you for supporting the mouse pads I also really like like your shelves showing everything you have displayed I love the plants the anime figures the personality in this setup C management could use a little help like you said in your notes um I would have liked to see you know maybe a Raceway or something like that on the back of that looks really really clean um also I love like whatever these knockoff [ __ ] Glide bars you have I also really like like you know the guitar in the wall I think it would have been a little bit better more spaced out to the left more and I love the color of the setup I think it like it just Blends in super well this is an 8.5 out of 10 this video is sponsored by guts.com my own mousepad company some of the setups in this video use are mouse pads so if you like what you see use the link down in the description to get one for yourself now back to the video all right Al this is Al he is 10 years old he does not have occupation he's located out of Finland and his main game is Apex Legends his previous setup was just a crappy keyo board Krabby Mouse and one monitor setup and he's upgraded to this one inspired in to build his current setup is your setup build videos thank you I appreciate that uh he built the setup for gaming and he built the setup about a little bit ago in 2022 took him about entire year to get to where it's exactly at now so he was like nine when he started building a setup he afforded a setup by birthday and Christmas money and he built the setup entirely by himself his future plans are just to get a bigger mouse pad and that is pretty much [ __ ] this 10-year-old has a better gaming setup than you no I love the blue color scheme PC looking like it's on har floor perfect Cable Management seems like it's okay you know he's got some posters in his room he's got a controller holder over there it seems like on the left side of his setup he's got a pegboard and some things that he likes you know red uh Red Bull and Monster looks like a hyperx keyboard and glorious model o it looks like this is such a really nice setup for 10 years old I like I'm very impressed just just because of his age and like what he's built at this age like my age at at 10 I didn't even have a setup bro I had a little $7 Ikea table that had like a big ass TV and I played on an Xbox 360 that's what I had at 10 this is Sasha setup they are 12 years old and their occupation is gaming and school and they are located out of England London their main game is Minecraft and their previous setup was an M1 MacBook and two Dell monitors attached to it inspired their to build their current setup is Tech Source and guts aen so I appreciate that they built their setup for 50% gaming and 45% watching YouTube and 5% schoolwork they built their setup in starting in August 2022 and got it to this point at December 2022 they afforded their setup for saving up about a year sold my Amo and MacBook for my uh to my mom did chores helped around the house saved some birthday money and also got the 3070 TI for Christmas they built the entire setup by themselves and their future plans are to get a 4070 or 4080 for the next PC and get one of your mouse pads and also maybe a a third Monitor and an Elgato Low Pro mic arm thank you I mean I love the PC off of the bat love this all white build looks like it's in the H5 flow the same case I built in so I love um how you organize the consoles I think this is great I think this is a gmk pro as well looks really clean and the cable management has these raceways which look really nice love that I think it's a flexi spot desk right the stons meter I like that I think it's really clean like the light bar above it I love it and also like you know your mic arm when you get that will be really helpful as well but overall i' give it like a 8.5 I love the aesthetic I love like where you're headed with the setup this is Julian he is 15 years old is occupation is school and he's located out of Germany his main game is Spider-Man Star Wars Battlefront 2 and a little bit of valerant his previous setup was just an Xbox One and a TV and he was tired of it so he wanted a double monitor setup and this summer he built it what inspired him to build current setup is me and uh Tech Source and some of his friends as well he built this setup for gaming and schoolwork and he built it summer of this year so 2022 uh it took him about a few hours to actually build the setup but he been he's been starting to build his setup in 2018 from a Nintendo switch to an old TV that he had with from his uncle and he's been upgrading it since so that's pretty cool 1070 an Asus B5 b450 F thermal take RGB case so that's cool he afforded his setup by saving up for birthdays and Christmases his future plans for the setup is to upgrade his desk and uh he really wants to save up the money to have one of my mouse pads so I really do appreciate that I love this aesthetic he building like with the brick wall and then like the lights and stuff I think it's really unique but I really love the vibe you're starting to build with the setup and then you have like a like a gaming setup here and I I like the position of this this is a really good organization uh the setup could use a little bit more work you know maybe some monitor mounts putting the PC on the floor to have more room maybe a mic arm as well I think it's probably an eight though I think it's probably an eight the boy Tech Tinker uh he is his name is Josh and he's 11 years old uh his occupation is school and he's located out of England uh his main game is Call of Duty and Arc and his previous setup was no cable management and a different PC with only two monitors he built the setup for gaming and he built the setup in 2019 and he slowly upgraded over time it took him about four years to completely build this entire setup ryzen 5 3600 oh 1660 TI perfect and the uh lean lee1 Dynamic he afforded a setup by saving up by birthdays and Christmases and who helped him build a setup which is pretty much himself cuz he knows a lot about tech his future plans is the cable manager cable manage setup just a little bit more than it already is let's take a look I love the Shelf with the personality I love the anime and then also like the Nal I think it looks really clean with the Shelf um I also love the two monitors and the the desk as well I think he's done a great job with that kind of design organized setup and I feel like the only thing that kind of holds it back is the PC which is not a huge deal he's 11 years old thank you for supporting the mouse pads too I do appreciate that for the setup portion I would give him a 7.5 all right moving on to the next setup this is Benji he's 11 years old we got a lot of youngans in this in this uh episode his occupation is school and gaming and he's located out of Australia his main game is Modern Warfare 2 in valerant and his previous setup was a TV in the living room with a PS4 what inspired him to build his current setup now is Tech Source and gutsy Aiden so thank you and what built his setup now is for gaming and school he built this in February 2021 and it took him about a year and 3 months to build his setup he afforded his setup by birthday money and also a lot of work over time his future plans for the setup is to B all three monitors on a monitor arm and also clean up the cable management and maybe a little bit more accessories for the setup I love I love like the Galaxy projector in the room this is his keyboard and mouse combo overall I really like the the three monitor setup I think he did a great job I love the I love the color scheme and I feel like you should try to match that with mouse pads and and peripherals and stuff over time I would probably say it's like a 6.5 this is makio setup he's a 17-year-old male out of Washington he afforded this setup by mowing lawns during the summer selling eggs and anything that pays okay his setup purposes gaming watching movies School workor coding and editing it took him around 4 years to build this entire setup and the main gains played on this setup is valerant Minecraft OverWatch here is the gear list right here here's his PC specs looking pretty healthy there and let's take a look at his setup what a nice one to start to keyboard and mouse combo pretty nice oh the room is nice too be awesome love that kale man's okay PC looks nice cables are not in sight lot of Personality lots of nice living things in here lots of plants I would give this a 10 this is Ki they're a 14-year-old out of California but they used to live in Japan okay so they they moved from Japan to California and then they're moving back to Japan soon it looks like their main games is Minecraft for Forza Horizon 5 and BNG Drive they built the setup to have a nice place to study and play games and it took them around 4 years to save up and 3 years to upgrade everything in the setup all right let's take a look this is very minimal I I actually agree it is very minimal the K manic could be a little better obviously like a Raceway or two but since you're planning to move back to Japan you know you're probably not 100% doing everything but I were to say when you go to move back I would say tail manage a little bit more get a Raceway before you go or something MacBook is nice I love how it's a dual PC setup you know you got your Mac for productivity and then you have your actual gaming PC for games and I love how you can switch between them that's really clean at 14 this is really nice PC looks good too second monitor needed maybe so maybe but I think there's not enough room in this setup so if you move back to Japan and you get a bigger space I'd recommend maybe a second monitor cable management and maybe a little bit more stuff on your walls and maybe some more personality but I love how minimal this is but overall I would say probably like a solid 6 6.5 this is lon he's a 19 y old from New York his main games is fortnite cod and valerant he built his entire gaming setup and it took him around tues days to build it all he's a dad to a 10-month old son and he's making the submission he used for his setup to relax and play games this is really nice my question is why do you need that many monitors like why do you need this many monitors PC looks nice oh I love the little sticker W oh that's adorable actually love to see the cemetry with the phones on the left and right in the Box in the middle honestly cable management is solid too I love this how you did the raceways and you put the power shps on each each side so you have more power and stuff KO management behind the monitor is pretty good and organized lighting is great too okay the door what is happening with the door why is there a hole in the door my thing is though with these little these paintings I know you're trying to make them center with the PC you know so they look there it just feels really out of place maybe do them like diagonal or something I feel like it's just too much in one spot when you have all this empty wall space I love this overall I would give this probably a solid I'm going to give it a solid 9.8 out of 10 this is Jay he's a 13-year-old out of California he mainly afforded the setup from reing soccer games and content creation his main games is fortnite and valerant and he built the setup for school and took him around one year to save up for everything and let's get into the setup there's a lot of things here um you guys can pause and read if you need dude look at that dude that's beautiful 13-year-old is crazy yeah I agree cable M's beautiful too on a cable in sight setup looks good the only thing I will say though is that the monitor sitting on the mouse pad like this can be kind of a nuisance sometimes and probably can be kind of quite annoying so what I would recommend is maybe getting another Mount or two individual mounts to mount for this top Monitor and this bottom monitor but this case is beautiful too the way you did built your PC looks really nice I love the pegboard how it stores some extra keyboards and you know your headset and a couple controllers if you use that what do you guys think about this I love the personality the lighting in the setup's great too I'll give this like a solid I'm going to give this a solid eight no I'm going to give it 8.5 this is Lane he's a 14-year-old out of Texas and he goes to school and he drop ships for his money his main games is fortnite and GTA and he wanted to level up his gaming experience and that's why he built this setup he afforded it by saving up money over Christmas birthdays and doing chores as well say less take a look the PC is funky wait is this a wait okay okay he's got a laptop too okay I was going to say it's not a laptop setup right no see this is nice the chair need some help for sure yeah the chair does need some help for sure yeah overall it's not a bad setup I mean you didn't really give me the best pictures to be honest but looking at the PC case I like how unique it is um the monitors are stacked pretty good too the only thing I would recommend is like this top monitor could be angled down just a little more so you don't hide you hide the Spectre but if you can't do that then flip it I would say I would have liked to see more personality cuz I don't see the rest of the room like this I would have led to see more of the surrounding setup you know what I mean I don't really like how the TVs like this I would have liked to center it above the setup I'm going to give it a solid seven seven I'm going to give it a seven chat I'll give y'all one picture and I will let you guys decide if you guys think I can say anything about this I'll give it one note cables are clean nice Cable Management set up but I'm not going to give you a wholesome thank you for submitting you didn't give enough pictures Chad doesn't want to see it unfortunately this is brillan he's a 13-year-old from Colorado and he started making this setup around 2 years ago he earned $1,500 for mowing and modeling so that's how he afforded the setup wait this is kind of nice I wonder what he modeled in someone said foot model maybe he is a shoe model I don't know okay I love this room it has so much personality like I love this I love how you did like the little waves on the wall the lighting the shelves the posters Hal Manion could be a little better right I mean you did what you could with this rack you could have chosen a better rack for this also like the that you were watching my stream when you submitted this this is great I like the lighting in this room too personally I would give this like the setup itself we're looking at the setup itself objectively personally it's not that insane right like just this corner room it's nice personality it's got one monitor very chill setup so I would give the setup itself maybe a seven but the room I'd give a nine this is Connor he's a 14-year-old almost and he's from England his main games are fortnite rocket League Call of Duty Apex and valerant and he built the setup mainly for gaming and a bit of streaming it took him around 4 years to get to the setup my mom my mom and dad helped me make the setup I like how he mounted like the old controllers in this this is really nice also like how you put the the disc plates on the wall too I like that okay the personality is great throughout the room all right what in the hell is going on with this setup man this potential this you have so much potential right you have an Xbox and a gaming PC right you got to find a way to declutter and cable manage it would it would carry the setup I think maybe what you need to do is just cable manage and organize and then Mount your monitor to the wall it would actually help a lot cuz wait you have two Xboxes one two and then three you have your PC oh it's a fridge it's a fridge it's a fridge chat it's a fridge oh my I would put your Xbox here instead of your fridge okay I put the fridge over here on the other side of the desk or something it's cool to show off but I literally thought that was your Xbox dude it's it's a cool thing but like i' put it over here or something if you want to keep it there though I'd move the Xbox on top of the PC and run all the cables similar and over that that way you can cable manage and everything the room itself and the personality throughout the room I would give it like a solid eight with the room aesthetic but the setup itself I think is like a solid five this is Landon he's a 14-year-old from Nebraska and his main game is Rainbow Six Siege fortnite and Madden he built a setup for gaming school and video editing let's take a look okay I like the personality throughout the room see this is very nice but the cable management dude I'm not want to talk cuz my cable management is bad right now right and I'm working on it but it has a ton of potential if you just cleaned up the cables right but it's a nice Vibe and then I also wouldn't lean your PS5 on the side like this you know I would just put it vertically but I do like how you kept it right here instead of on your desk somewhere I'd recommend getting a bigger desk here like if you can move your room around a little bit and get a little bit of a bigger desk and you can have more mouse pad room put your PC in this very back corner keep the speakers there and then run another side table if you need it I would give it like a solid six this is risky he's a 15-year-old out of Illinois and his main games are rocket League Cod and fornite it took him around 2 and 1/2 years in counting to build this setup and he wanted to play games with friends and have good performance while doing so looking at the C management I mean it's not terrible but it's not good either right I mean like why is that stream camera on the ground what's going on here a lot of the cables could just be like literally attached to the bottom of the desk and it would it would fix itself looking at the PC right looks normal at first glance why is Bros fan not on the CPU Cooler it's hanging off it's got one attachment at the top why is it it's literally it's literally falling off it's touching his Ram dude and then the monitors got the giraffe looking type of monitor like it's so high up and this monitor seems abnormally like big like is this a TV you know like this seems very like massive like this seems a big side monitor right like overall I mean the setup has a nice aesthetic with the lighting I think you should really improve on that by like adding some more stuff on your walls and maybe you know a little bit better organization throughout the setup but I think there's a few things you you should fix like the K management this fan right and then also the monitor layout I guess maybe get a bigger main monitor looking at it overall I'd probably say it does need a little bit of work I will give it like a 5.5 out of 10 I'll give chat the opportunity do you guys want to me to react to this I'm getting a lot of twos and a lot of ones I'm going to flip a coin Chat Heads I react to it Tails I don't it was Tails but we're going to skip this one this is Aaron he's a 16-year-old and he lives is in England and he's in his last year of secondary school his main games are fortnite war zone and GTA he built the setup so he can play with friends and also do some schoolwork currently using the Xbox series s and his sister's laptop for a second Monitor and he's hoping to upgrade his PC in the future the shoe collection is kind of fire my question is bro has a better shoe collection and this probably is super expensive it most definitely could be fakes I really like the personality of the room I think it's great the one thing I would say is like why have a a very cheap laptop I mean you could definitely upgrade to a PC very soon but the kid manag there's like a bunch of random cables here oh I think that he's wearing the headset in the pictures he's wearing the headset and he's taking the picture right but he didn't take the controller with him so it just connected to the to the controller personalities there I would say a a little bit reorganization of the actual setup itself could be a little better for this specific setup because it seems like the laptop and the Xbox seem very weird and the monitor's like so far to the right where it's like not centered with this at all um so I would recommend maybe a monitor mount to Center this one this the G management could be a little better too maybe a Raceway or so could really help this out but overall not a terrible idea I'd give this like a solid personality of the room I'd give it like a solid 6.57 and then the setup itself I'd probably give like a 4.5 or five I'm going give it a five actually Adam age 19 my setup has been upgraded pretty much from the ground up I started with a very cheap PC back in 2016 and I've been selling and upgrading Parts one by one over time I started with one cheap Monitor and a cheap desk with the bare minimum peripherals I range my setup like this cuz it allows me to have not only a vertical screen but also have a second horizontal screen as well it helps reading chat Discord and any multimedia on the top screen I fored the setup I getting my money through my birthdays and Christmas parts and selling other things to upgrade at a lower cost all right let's take a look at your setup off the rip I really like this this aesthetic you're going for overall I love the aesthetic I love this wallpaper you've got going this Blue and White theme with this cyan blue I think it's beautiful rocking the uh the low swirl mouse pad and then on top of that we got uh gr Pro and a keyboard as well yeah it's awesome man the one recommendation off the rip I would say is this setup with the cable management I feel like you're making them tidy per se but I feel like overall it doesn't really fit this desk because you can see it all from like if you're standing or like you're looking back so to make this less seen raceways and maybe making the cables a little tighter to the desk might help overall though it looks really good I think I think you've done a really good job at the aesthetic and making the top of the desk look good the aesthetic is great mic placement is great I going to say 6.5 moving on from Adam setup this is AI setup or Al setup at first I set up was a college dorm desk one Monitor and a pre-built and a custom keyboard I was limited to the amount of space I could put my desk in but I didn't have that much room for creativity I promised to myself one day that I have enough money to build my own setup no matter the cost and I've always wanted to build a setup like this I saw in the YouTube videos and the gaming setup reviews and I strive to accomplish it I worked all summer to uh and almost maxed out my credit card to build everything I wanted in this setup after call I planned on streaming until my career really takes off I really told that I could be a great personality and a great streamer in the future thank you man for submitting and let's go ahead and take a look at your set up looking at this right off the rip I really love this aesthetic I love the wide monitor with the bigger monitor on top and then the goby bar across the top I really like that um let's go and take a look at the rest of this yeah I love the keyboard combo with the mouse the mouse pad's cool not for me but it looks cool um on top of that I really love this Nintendo switch with some speakers and stuff like that the speakers are placed awesome and then the cable management isn't awful but it it could be a little bit better but it's great um the PC aesthetic is great too I love this red white and black theme you're going for and then you got like a Spider-Man holding a controller which is kind of cool but overall man this setup is has a really great wild Factor love this the lighting in your room man it just this is a beautiful setup man like this is this is awesome really really great I would say this is a 9.9 out of 10 thank you for submitting we're going to move on people who are asking uh to submit by the way just letting you know there's a full YouTube video on how to submit all right Albert is up next my last PC was an MSI laptop with a 3070 and I I bought it piece after piece working hard as an aviation flight dispatcher my plan is to upgrade my setup and he wants to upgrade his motherboard his ddr5 instead of ddr4 Ram uh CPU and another 4,000 GPU after the New Year dude this is sick for a 28-year-old that just plays games and as a flight Aviator that's really cool I've never heard that job before this is really dope you know it's a minimal setup it doesn't have a lot but he just plays games casually man it's not like he needs he wants to be a streamer or anything he literally just plays games to have fun and his main game is rust which is interesting to me bro plays Rust and he's a flight guy man he's going to be flying to helicopters in Rust and being like welcome to Landing it looks great right off the rip I love the PC little mini Leon Lee PC with some fans and a nice GPU with the hints of red I love that tail management is decent works so well dude this is awesome I mean it's not really a lot to tell him I can't really complain I mean if you just come home you play like 3 to 4 hours of games a night and you don't like stream or make any content like this is a perfect setup like overall man this is a beautiful setup overall though I would say this is probably a solid seven or eight that's awesome that you're 28 and you want to play games and you're getting into the setup stuff I love this man I think it's great thank you for submitting all right on to the next one this one is Damian setup age 14 before it was just an Amazon black L-shaped desk with an Xbox once I turned 13 I started messing with it and started sauc it up a little bit now I'm 14 and this is what it looks like I changed it all to White cuz I like the lighter colors and I feel like that would go great with RGB and it took me over a year to get it how it was now I got the money from doing chores side jobs and everything else and I bought a PC for myself as well in the future I plan on C managing a little bit and probably upgrading my PC any recommendations on what to add awesome going off the first pictures uh the first couple pictures and first impressions I see I really like the aesthetic You're Building you've got this really nice wall space to work with you've kind of filled it in a good way you've got like the stack shelves here the pegboard the leaves across the wall it's got like this nature vibe to it I also like that you've got two of my mouse pads thank you for supporting and then on top of that you've got like a work space and a gaming space which is great too KO management it could be a little bit better if you had maybe some raceways and stuff like that but overall man I love this setup I think you built it incredibly I think also you did a great job with having some shelves and some wall panels and stuff like that all of it fits really great overall this is this is beautiful yeah I think this is probably a 7. or an eight overall looks great man thank you for submitting Damian give him chills now this setup I had a really really big glimpse of but oh my God this setup give him chills is beautiful it's a dual setup he has 27 and he's doing Tech content is how he afforded it and rebuilt his PC into a smaller case for space reasons so let's take a look at this entire setup",

jealous man okay look at how beautiful this Peg boards is like how he did the wall the lighting it's all symmetrical with the Monitor and then on top of that like the the light bars on the floor and then he's got like a working setup over here with a Macbook like this is awesome bro this is beautiful oh my God I I I do I dare say it chat do I dare say this is a 10 out of 10 this is 10 out of 10 bro down to the Xbox being skinned the same as all of his peripherals from the aesthetic to everything he's got his Xbox skin to his Xbox controller skin to his phone case to his headphones he's got headphones hangers on his peg board this is immaculate bro I love his PC he also said that he built it into a smaller case which he didn't have pictures for but he went down as far as to cut his light switch out of the panels like dude that is incredible this is insane I don't even know what to say thank you for submitting I guess I mean it's the most beautiful setup I've ever seen it's it's literally [ __ ] perfect all right looking at the last setup here this is Jerome setup we're going to go and take a look I was rocking a laptop setup since I'm a doctor and I practically live in the hospital but then I transition to a PC eventually and I like to keep my set up nice and clean with a bit of RGB D I have a doctor in my chat damn I'm rocking a ryzen 53600 with an RTX 380 and a b550 motherboard also rocking a Liam Le case and a 34in 1440p Ultra rde Monitor and the edifier r112 working as a doctor not much I'm probably going to upgrade the setup for a while since I got a 3080 all right let's go take a look at what this doctor's setup looks like I mean honestly this is beautiful I really like this setup with the two speakers up top I love that you've got some stuff underneath your monitor to hold everything um it also looks like you have a shelf up top I don't know if you have a picture of it on top of that though I really love the aesthetic of like your your mouse and your keyboard looks really really good on top of that I like that you have like uh your cable management and your headphone hanger down there which is great as well cable Management's pretty good uh got some cable raceways and stuff like that or cable clips to idle the cable stuff like that on top of that he's got an an AIO and GPU as well but yeah man very very minimal I love the aesthetic I love the goie Glide with the little wall panels behind that thank you so much for submitting Grant let's take a look at his setup here he's 12 years old from Tennessee I love the the backgrounds already he's a student and he mainly uses a setup for gaming and schoolwork uh his main game is fortnite which I love the keyboard by the way keyboard looks really clean uh and his old setup was a PS4 and a TV so he's been upgrading a lot as you can see he started building the setup in 2021 and it's taken him about 2 years to put it all together and he built it from working jobs around his neighborhood looking at the setup I mean he built it by himself it's really solid and in my opinion I mean I really like the color combo like I think you're doing a really good job with that staying true to black and white you know and then the monitors and then the mouse pad and the keyboard I think it really just matches all the way through the only recommendation I'd really give here is putting your PC maybe off the desk it would give your set up more symmetry where you can put your speaker right here next to the Monitor and then you can put your PC on the floor or something like that honestly for 12 years old I'm pretty impressed it looked great I'd probably rate this a solid I'd probably give it a solid seven right down the middle like you know I think a solid seven would be great for this setup personalities on point C management could use some work but I think it's great I think it's great for what he's got the next one is by Sam uh Sam is a 15-year-old from Maryland he's a student and he uses a setup for gaming he started building setup in 2019 and he's still not finished so he's still upgrading and it's taken him around 4 years to build all of it he built it by saving money and working for his dad the biggest thing that's holding this setup back is manage I alone that was like the first thing I noticed also um I'd recommend maybe moving your your audio interface maybe to underneath your desk it could hide it a lot and you can also put your uh headphone hanger on the side that way it can like kind of all hide together which I think would be would be great as well I think I think the biggest thing is cable management and add P more personality here the mic placement I think is could be better too I think I could probably rate this solid five out its 10 love the love the aesthetic you're going with you know this is a great aesthetic I think over cable management more personality it would be better so all right next up is Victor he's 14 years old for the Netherlands he's a student and he uses his setup for gaming and studying he started building his setup in 2020 and 2021 kind of and it's taken around 2 years to save up all the money and build it he's inspired to build this setup by Tik Tok and as well as gutsy aen thank you man I appreciate that I love the the Black and White theme I always said this all the time like I love Black and White theme setups I think that they do really really good the only thing that I can complain about the setup is it just feels cluttered it just feels really cluttered like there just seems like to be so much stuff in one area so I recommend like maybe getting some shelves or making it to maybe Mount your monitor stack in some way you know something like that uh to where there's there's both I like to see more personality in it and like you can see literally in this PC case like you can see the rest of his room here like the rest of his room has more personality we just don't see it right but I would like to see that like in your setup Incorporated in your setup as well I think honestly I would probably say a solid seven out of 10 I like the color theme a lot I think that has a lot of potential we're going to move on to the next setup here the next setup is Tommy he's 11 years old from Mississippi 11-year-old setup he's a student and he uses his setup for gaming his old setup has an old Xbox One and a TV started building this setup in December of 2022 and it took him about 3 months to build he's able to build it all by working and doing chores me personally I like the theme of the setup I think it's kind of wacky you know like I would have liked to see like if you're going blue and like red and like stuff like that mixed in your setup I would have liked to see more of that reflected on your monitors it seems like when you bought your keyboard and mouse you're going for a different color theme but if you're going to move to this black and white color theme I think it could benefit you a lot also I like that you did add a little bit of personality in the corner of the shelves adding things you like yeah I just I think the keyboard and mouse need an upgrade a little bit and I know you're a little young to like make that decision but I mean for the most part I mean k manin is really easy you could fix this pretty easily and then also like the shelves I like a lot yeah I just I I think the the keyboard and mouse could be upgraded a lot for sure um in my opinion I'd probably rate this a solid six the next setup is by Landon Landon is a 13-year-old from California he's a student and he uses his setup for gaming and relaxing his old setup had a TV chair and an Xbox so he's kind of upgraded a lot taking them up until now to build it to where it's at now I was inspired to build this setup by watching other setup videos and is able to build this setup by using Christmas and birthday money it's PS5 setup I mean love the mouse pad thank you for supporting you know keyboard and mouse match together that's great as well also so it's very interesting that you said you upgraded from like a TV and you just use another TV I think it's funny I think I really like it though I think it's super unique you know like having a TV and then PS5 and a desk like this with keyboard and mouse I think it's really interesting the panels I really like in the background too also the the image of the room like just the room itself look how much personality the room has I I genuinely like it all the different things about this person I feel like I could literally go into each part of the room I I could figure out a different thing about the person and I I think this is really good example of like you don't need to have an insane setup you just need to have like a really nice personality and like a vibe to your room you know I'd probably rate this setup a solid like seven out of 10 I think I I I really like it I just think that the personality along with the setup area too like the setup area itself is kind of clean as well I like it a lot going on to the next setup by Rudy he's a 13-year-old from Texas is a student and mainly uses their setup for gaming on the side he resells on Facebook Marketplace and sells food at school I started building the setup around a week go it only took him about 3 days to put everything together he's able to buy a set up from reselling on Facebook Marketplace and if you'd like to add Nal goby lights soon looking at the setup I think it's really chill I like the cars like on the on the side I think this this area is put together really nice the controllers are nice the plants nice K management looks good for the most part I also really like where the PC is placed the plants like really hide all the the K management too it's a really good vibe in the setup I really like it I genuinely think that he did a great job for what he had and for him to like save up and and build that I think it's great red does ruin it though I agree I think you should get a new mouse pad and maybe like you know cover up the red with some different things as well but overall I think this is probably a solid eight I really like how he like put everything together and like it's very unique and chill moving on to the next setup here the next one is Kaden oh man a laptop setup he's 12 years old from Pennsylvania he's a student and he mainly uses a setup for gaming uh his main game is Gorilla tag okay his old setup had an old Xbox One and a TV he started building his setup in December M 2021 and it only took him about 3 days to build all of it he was able to build the setup using Chris's money so that's kind of a w okay so we got a laptop setup here the only thing I could give you is like maybe getting a monitor and once you get a monitor like you could put that PC to the left side and then make a main monitor setup type of thing it's a laptop setup there's not really much to really expect from it right it's honestly a pretty good setup for what he has you know and I can't really complain about that like I can tell them you know move your mic here and stuff like that but I think the biggest thing is like taking the set up usable for what he can use if he uses it perfectly fine and it's good for what he has then that's great I'd probably say it's a solid 5.5 there's really not anything that I could say that's like you know oh this set upan it's you know it's a work in progress man he's going to build it over time I probably rate a solid 5.5 moving on to Grant S he's 11 years old from Minnesota he's a student and he uses a setup for gaming and school I started building his setup in February 2023 and he just finished building his setup as of today he built the setup by using his Christmas money and chores this is what I mean about a perfect laptop setup you know what I'm saying laptop mount on the side with single monitor keyboard mouse right the other setup was what I was saying is like this is a great example of what the other setup should do you know what I'm saying and he's 11 years old I mean this is beautiful for 11 yearold like this is great and honestly I think you did a great job with this keyboard and mouse look great as well even though their budget I think they work very well and yeah I think this is great man I love it a lot also uh the cable management is also great as well underneath it's like you know at least tidied and P as as tight as he could I think that this is a solid 8 out of 10 in my opinion for 11 years old beautiful execution it's it's very clean lighting's great and yeah I think he did a great job all right the next setup is AJ he's a 12-year-old from New Jersey he's a student and he also makes Tech content he built a setup for gaming editing and YouTube and his main games are fortnite and Minecraft I started building his setup in 20122 and it's taking him around 3 weeks to build it all where it's at right now he's inspired to build it by Tik Tok and wanting to content so looking at the setup I mean I love the aesthetic of it the mic placement the beacon mic being white and also like you know the mouse pad with the keyboard mouse and the case being black and white too the theme is really clean and also like I like the little two plants being white and black I think that's really dope as well one thing I want to say about the cable management all you'd have to do is Mount this power strip to the back of one of the Alex Shores I feel like there's not enough personality in the setup yes the setup's very very clean but i' like I would have liked to see stuff on the walls like you know shells panels anything like like literally anything about you overall it's really clean for a 12-year-old though like you did a great job next up is Jonas's setup as 14 years old from Austria he's a shoe reseller and he mainly uses a setup for gaming his main game is valer and fortnite and his old setup had a bad gaming laptop and monitor and keyboard and mouse so he's kind of upgraded all that and he started building his setup in 2022 it took him around a year to build it to where it's at now and he built the setup using birthday money Christmas money and reselling shoes so looking at the setup I really like the natur natural light in the setup the plants are great I love the pegboard as well keyboard and mouse that he's using in this with this Jordy mouse pad looks insanely clean I really do like the vibe you've got going on here but overall I love the color theme you're going for I think the keyboard with this mouse pad matches like perfectly with this keyc cap set like I just think it matches like really really good but the personality is also there like we got the pegboard in the top right we got the cars there you know I would have liked to see like maybe a poster up here or something overall he's got shelves and and everything like that he's got a lot of personality in the setup so I can't complain I think he did a great job with the setup in my personal rating I'd probably rate it I'm going to go solid8 out of 10 all right next up is Callum he's 28 years old from the UK he's a full-time content creator and CEO of a videography company his mainly uses a setup for gaming content and work and his main games are csgo and valerant he started building setup in April of 2023 and it only took him around 8 hours to put it all together he built the setup using free products and reviews and as well well as in his work so looking at the setup I I really like everything I see here I think so far like he built a lot of personality in his setup like the camera is in a good spot you can tell he likes Star Wars game boy he likes valerant you can see the valerant jet knife there gimbal for his camera work and then like the pegboard on the left side with a bunch of uh personality in there and you can also tell he likes Adventure Time there's just so many like little aspects of Personality that he likes in his setup and I think it adds such a nice vibe to the setup I would probably rate this like a solid nine out of 10 I I think T management wise great personality wise great organization wise great use functionality great like I think this is like a solid setup let's look at the take a look at the next one by Ahmed Ahmed I hope I said your name right he's a 13 years old from Dubai he's a student as well as a stock Trader he built the setup for gaming Netflix and stocks he started building this setup in May of 2020 so he's been upgrading a lot since then and took him around 3 years to build it all and he built a setup for a saving and as well as stocks but yeah looking at the setup it's super clean I mean 13 years old and you know I would have again personality is like key for me whenever I react to setups I always talk about personality and this setup doesn't really have much personality in it it's very clean I love the PC um the color scheme is beautiful as well I think he did a great job kill management you know could be better but it's it's tidied enough and like looking at the entire setup I think you did a great job though like looking at that you know you did a great job I just think that there's so much room on like this wall is massive you know you got this massive wall that has like so much room that you can just like put anything on and I think there's so many things that like could help uh you know build this setup a little bit and make the setup like stand out I would probably rate this setup a solid I'm going to go a solid 7 out of 10 I think everything else he has is great I think he just needs to add personality next up is Aaron's setup he's a 14-year-old from Tennessee and he works at Chick-fil-A and uses his main setup for gaming his main games are Cod war and War Zone 2 and he started building his setup in the last month of April 202 it took him up until now to put it all together and it built the setup by working at Chick-fil-A that's kind of cool though all right let's take a look at the setup um again with this personality thing I always talk about this in every setup you know there's just not enough personality you know like overall though the setup looks really clean and minimal and like blacked out I think it looks great I would have just liked to see like that reflected on the walls too I just feel like it's super minimal but doesn't have a lot of personality but overall I think the setup is great I think you did a great job I I would probably rate this a solid a solid 8 out of 10 just because I really like the natural light in the room and that it's a black and stealth look I just think he needs to add a little bit more personality let's move on to the next setup here this is banjo's setup he's a 15-year-old out of Australia he's a student and he built a setup for gaming and content his main games are Rainbow Six Siege and Apex his old setup was a single monitor setup with a bad keyboard he started building this setup at the start of 2023 it's taken him around one year to build the entire setup he inspired to build it by gutsy Aiden Tech Source and low that's awesome man so looking at the setup I mean I kind of like how it's like built in to the setup I really like that I think the cable management coming through the Shelf is a really genius idea I I think this is super unique and like underrated kind of because then he could like maybe I would recommend M mounting the monitor more Center cuz it would look a lot better if it was like like straight like this in my opinion I think it would look better like centered um but overall I think this is a great idea of having your monitors like this and I like it's kind of like it's almost like a cub cool I I I just think it's really unique and also I would have liked to seen a a headphone hanger maybe underneath the side of the desk maybe on the wall you know somewhere just you know to where you could have it hung up instead of just like on the side of your desk there's not a whole lot of personality I see some cars and stuff like that but you know the theme is consistent you know there's purple white but yeah overall what do you guys think out of uh out of 10 chat what do you guys think yeah a lot of chat saying 7 58 all right we're going to move on from the setup all right the next one is by Ryan oh my gosh he's 12 years old from Philadelphia oh my God what he built the setup from for Content through 3D modeling and for my brother he builds PCS and upgrades them for a side of work and his old setup was a triple monitor setup he was inspired to build a setup from guty Aiden and teur so thank you I appreciate you I started building this setup in 2022 it taken him around a year to put everything together oh my gosh this is kind of crazy man that's insane man so looking at this setup I mean this is nuts it's like this PC is crazy yeah there's really not a whole lot of personality in this setup I can't lie but the keyboard is cool the keyboard's very cool I like that a lot so looking at the setup I mean I I really like the monitor layout the four monitors I'm assuming that since he said he buil this for his brother I'm assuming his brother is maybe older submitting as him so I'm assuming that's what happened here but this could be a 12-year-old setup this could be one of the 12-year-old plays on this setup and it could be his or they share it but I really like the setup I think it's very plain though I would have liked to see a lot more personality or if you guys are like brothers I would have loved to see like a dual setup together overall I really like this setup I'd probably say this as solid 9 out of 10 I really love this setup I think it's a great overall really really clean thank you for submitting the next setup is by Henry he's a 12-year-old from England he's a student and he mainly uses a setup for gaming and YouTube his main games are Minecraft and fortnite his first setup was a PS4 TV and a sofa so he's kind of upgraded to an actual desk he started building his setup in February 2023 and it's taken him around a month to get where he's at now he built a setup by washing cars and other jws for Neighbors I think the biggest thing about this setup that I like is that it's super clean and minimal and it has hints of his personality in it now the walls are still blank I still think that we could have some personality there but I like that he's added like you know the dog the plant you know the headphone hanger like things like that and then like when you look around the room too you'll see that there's like different things that like make it set up him and I think the color scheme like right here this thing right here where there's like the the baby Yoda and like the plants and the shelves and stuff like that I think it's really solid for his age like I just think he built a really nice setup the green and white setup I think it's great I think the color scheme is great as well I think overall I'd probably raate this a solid seven out of 10 I think it's great I think you're doing a great job with it and yeah I think you did a great job dude this episode's going to be full of insane setups you guys ready for this one this one is deny setup he is 27 is occupation is operator at San I think is how it's said he's from Italy and his main games are CSO in Minecraft um what inspired him to build his current setup is my channel so thank you so much and what built uh what he built for his current setup is work and gaming he built the setup in June it took him about 3 months and he afforded this by working permanent jobs for years so he started saving money for a new pc uh he built the setup himself and here it is so this is my boy denies man this guy is crazy already off the bat I'm loving this white and black color scheme with the the panels behind it and the Shelf I love this I think how clean this is I love the lighting as well the only thing I like to see is if the wall panels continue to the end of the wall and to the end of the side here for the most part I love the plants and the aesthetic you've got going on I think you've done a great job of making everything fit and on top of that you know having a great workspace I love how like the K management is solid here as well like as well as you put the clock in your PC which I haven't seen anybody do all the people want to hang the clock on their wall but they don't want to put it in their PC so that's cool I would almost rate this a 9.5 this video is sponsored by guts.com my own mousepad company some of the setups in this video use are mouse pads so if you like what you see use the link down in the description to get one for yourself now back to the video all right moving on to the next setup here this is Damian he is 14 years old and he's a content creator out of Florida um his main game is Grand Theft Auto 5 and his previous uh setup was just an Xbox and a TV and what inspired him to build his current setup is uh just playing games over time maybe want to upgrade and I started recording my progress on Tik Tok and I found it very fun to me I started making videos upgrading my setup and I've been doing well that's awesome uh he started building his setup about 2 years ago and it took about 2 years to build this entire setup uh he afforded this setup by his working for his dad and his side hustle and he built his setup himself and he doesn't have any ideas that he wants to add to it currently so this already off of the bat looks really nice I'm loving this stacked monitor setup here with the nice personality and the leaves on the side I also love how you have a bunch of cool space here and you've done a great job with like the space you have I love that you've got like things you like on the shelves and I like that you have like a bunch of Personality then you have a keyboard building station on the side everything else just looks so nice and I love the aesthetic You're Building uh I love your PC it looks really nice so it looks so sick man great job so if I'm honest I'd rate this an 8 out of 10 or a n 8.5 out of 10 I love this man looks so nice all right we're moving on to someone that is in chat this is et's setup ety is 16 years old he's a content creator out of Houston his main game is OverWatch 2 and his old gaming setup used to be really cluttered and not functional for videos and content creation which I agree I've seen his old setup what inspired him to build his uh current setup is I've always wanted to see what my setup looked like if I just cut it down to the bare minimum and while trying to maintain a personality um he built the setup for streaming and content and he finished this current of the setup about 3 weeks ago he's been building a setup for almost 6 years now so that's dope he afforded a setup by uh content creation on Tik Tok which is so cool various creators on Tik Tok help be inspire me uh Inspire different aspects of my setup and I can't say ones in specific person gave me inspiration my goal within the year is to have a full content Studio separated from my bedroom for videos and streaming that's a W uh so off of the bat here it's looking like a black blue and white setup on top of that I love this this monitor layout I also love how you have your camera on the uh on this boom arm um and I think this is old yeah this is his old setup right here on top of that PC here's his PC right here um everything else looks really solid man you did an insane job it just looks so good I would say it's a it's a 8.7 and this is Valentin he is 13 a student out of Germany his main game is valerant OverWatch 2 and fortnite and his previous setup was just a Macbook first generation that's crazy uh what inspired to build is his current setup is mainly setup and setup Wars in my videos he built a setup for gaming watching YouTube and a little bit of school work uh he built the setup on December 1st of last year and it's been about a year and a half to build this entire setup uh he afforded this setup by Saving uh money on birthdays and Christmases and he built it on his own he wants to get another monitor and an RTX 360 and maybe a new desk yeah dude this is really solid bro I love the wall I think the wall is so sick dude this is so nice dude for 13 years old this is this is insane I love this PC case too I think it's like Corsair keyboard mouse rkade 61 I think dude this aesthetic is so clean bro like your K Management's on point I will say this is some of the best K management we've seen on the show in a long time and this guy is rcking a budget setup and has better K management than you so how do you feel I would say it's probably a solid 7.5 this is Chason uh Chason he is 14 years old and his occupation is that he works at the lake during the summertime and he fills up gas in the boats that's kind of cool he's located in Al abama and his main game is Apex this is his very first setup and what inspired him to build this setup is it is it is his current Hobby and enjoys computer building he built the setup for school and gaming and he built it about 6 months ago it took about 3 years to save up and build this setup he afforded a setup I filling up boats in the summertime his dad helped him with the table and he wants to see him Prosper so he helped him with the setup he wanted to start a YouTube channel to teach people to make money and tips and tricks and stuff about how to make more money W so off the rip I love that you've got the Pokémon cards up top I think it's really cool I love the GOI Glide across this as well I think it looks really really dope um the PC looks really nice and it is well spec props to you I love the way this looks I think you could have went with a 360 mil route here though on top of that I love that you have a racing Sim on the right side and a bunch of like Lego Star Wars stuff I love the ultra white as well I think you should Mount that to the wall I think it looks solid as well the way you have everything is really nice it's just you need to figure out a way to like declutter and move everything around and have a place for it uh yeah I think I think it it you know it has all the potential but you just haven't like unlocked that yet in my opinion I would say it's a a six out of 10 this next setup his name is Mason this is Mason he is 13 years old and he's a middle school student out of Florida his main games are valerant and OverWatch and his previous setup was boring and a a console setup he got inspired by me Tech Source and opium Tech to build his current setup uh his setup is built for gaming and schoolwork and he built it in late August of 2022 uh it took him about 2 to 3 months to build this setup and uh he afforded a setup by saving up at Christmas's birthdays and small side hustles in his neighborhood I mainly built the PC myself but my dad helped me with the wall shelf and the peg boards as well I help my friend helped me build the PC and he wants to upgrade his PC specs in the future his his current PC is very budget and sometimes slow so he'd like to uh also Mount his main monitor so I love the little shelf off the bat on the right and the PS4 I think it looks really dope on top of that I think it looks really nice you got like this little peg board here I love that and then I also love the key caps and the mouse pad um yeah the PC is a little budget that's totally fine I mean you're you're you're very young so it's okay but yeah it's awesome that you at least can run some stuff and then also I love that you took the time the cable manage I I lowkey think you should have flipped this around to where the the black part is facing us for 13 years old I would probably say this is a 6 three out of setup out of 10 this is George he's a 13-year-old that lives in the Netherlands and his brother is Harry and he inspired to build this setup from guts a and tourus he's trying to go pro in fortnite so that's what he built the setup for and the PC specs are right here he said we hope we enjoy his setup yo wait I kind of like this a little console setup no wait this is kind of nice yo monitor arm the Xbox I love the little personality here I love the the wall paint and the background oh maybe this is old setup or something no oh wait this is this is his brother's setup okay wait it's a dual it's two brothers two brothers play together I got it got it got it got it so this is behind him and this is his brother's setup this is a really solid console setup man I mean I like the older brother's setup for sure probably one of the best console setups I've seen in a long time I love it dude the plant the shelving the personality in the setup really really nice my opinion I genuinely like this I think I would give this a,

to add just that little more personality but overall dude this is really clean you know also what I would really love to see and this might be like just a personal preference but if you get more Nano Leafs I would love to see the Nano Leaf just go all the way down here love this I would give this a solid this is Alexander a 15-year-old from San Francisco and he afforded this set up by working at a coffee shop he's inspired by me and Tech Source and his main game is cod in fortnite he's been working on it since he was in the sixth grade and he built the set up all by himself but his dad did help him with the desk love you Dad dude I saw this from like just scrolling through and I was like I have to react to this one like for 15 years old the wallpaper the way you built the setup the mounts the desk the cable management like this is beautiful looking at this whole setup I mean the attention to detail on this is incredible keyboard and mouse very very minimal and clean PC looks very good as well looking at the left side we've got like a little productivity setup here with you know a little peg board behind it some pens a shelf and then another little car shelf as well one thing I'd recommend is actually flip this car around because it would match the the painting but overall dude beautiful setup I mean people are probably asking what this this little like RGB light is this is just the GOI free free form thing you can kind of put it in whatever you want but I love that he just kind of stuck with this like lighter green with the blue I think it's really clean it it really tied the setup together on the desk you know you got the Razer Viper ultimate and white and then also some Razer headphones with the white as well nice little clock that fits in there and he was able to fit some nice cable sheathing over it in white so it's hidden even more very insane insane setup for 15 I mean this is beautiful the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 is like there is a little bit of the wall being empty you know like besides the monitors like there's like this little shelf here but I feel like there's a lot of open space I definitely think it could be a little better but overall not this is K he's a 14-year-old out of Ohio he afforded the set up for mowing lawns and starting a clothing business and his main games are the finals Val and Madden he built the setup to uh play games and study for school and it took him around 2 to 3 years to build the entire setup K manag is pretty on point for the most part I I think it's so nice how it like fits in between the wall in my opinion I would have put the Alex on the left side this is just my opinion maybe you did this because the PC and you're scared of like having like it floating you know it seems awkward like it seems like you hit this a lot right so it was on the left at least you'd have more right on your your your room on your right and maybe that's just me I would have liked to see a little bit more in the in the actual setup itself you know like it seems very bare but it's also very clean and minimal so I'd recommend like some paintings and canvases and stuff like that the juvie cans are nice but I would recommend maybe a mini fridge behind you or something to keep those going or maybe a small one on the desk I would say it's solid nine we're almost there but the last three setups are my favorite this is Michael's setup he's ready he's ready for it he's already in the chat dude this is Michael he is a editor which he's actually my editor he mainly does video editing to afford this setup and some light gaming as well currently Elite in fortnite okay had to flex on me I know I'm Diamond get out of here anyway he's been building this setup since he moved in this house so about 4 years now and he has his own office aside from his bedroom here's some of his PC specs right here here's some of the things he has as well and his dad did a lot of construction room in this office from painting mounting things building desks Etc it would not have been possible without his help he super appreciated with the time and energy put into this and also I posted like 2 months ago got flamed from my setup so honestly hopefully this one doesn't get bullied into Oblivion bro gave me the graenest photos I've ever seen in my life anyway looking at the setup I mean I really like the aesthetic that you have kind of went for I love this wall I love the grass wall with the shelves and the the light it's got like a rustic vibe to it which I really like keyboard mouse mouse pad combo fire love it also love the little proven wrong sticker hey that's pretty clean love the PC as well all blackout type of theme very very clean and overall the room just looks really nice I would give this a solid 9.5 this is Braden a 13-year-old from New Hampshire and his main games are valerant fortnite and Minecraft he built a setup for school workk and to relax and play some video games it took him around 3 years to get to this point where it is now and his parents paid for a few things in the setup and he doesn't have a job so he saved up from birthdays and Christmas money to afford the rest of the setup okay that's pretty badass though I love this okay this is awesome okay the KO management is like crazy right but this is badass for 13 this is like really cool I love this the cables are kind of wild though I would really recommend some raceways man the fact that you taped every single one of these cables I mean more power to you what even are those I don't even know they might be lifx but I'm not sure but I love how you did the cloud ceiling I love the Nan Le on the wall I love how you did the shelves and the personality there little GoPro type beat here for a cam if you need it 3D little printer you know little 3D printing action for 13 man this is actually really nice I think he did an incredible job with the personality I love the little glowing canvas on the wall I love the lighting I love the cloud ceiling he did an incredible job I love the color scheme I would give this a solid 10 man this is Yo Hami also known as yo he wanted to share a bit of his custom gaming setup which he's been working on on the past 3 years lots of DIY stuff and with with some other projects that are 3D printed he can share the stls if you would like them I've been seeing your setups and they look very well executed clean and lots of potential especially for your young age please feel free to ask me any questions otherwise um he's a 39-year-old damn he's he might be the oldest member in This Server no unfortunately you're not he works in the uh Healthcare field working on uh building the setup slowly over the 3 years there's somebody who's 46 in our Discord that's the oldest person I think here's everything he has in his setup and wow this is an incredible setup man I'm so excited to see this what the f is this this is incredible dude what is this dude the the custom work in this Beast of a setup is insane the custom PC like the custom keyboard cases I love the cable management too cable management is pretty good here love that the lighting in the room is so badass I love how you like implemented all the lighting and it looks very Spider-Man themed you know I also really like how you did a custom a bunch of custom things here like how the stream deck fits customly in between the double Ultra wide what is this dude what do you tell me what you use this setup for I would love to know what you what you use this big ass monitor the Odyssey Arc for in vertical what do you use this for and then on top of that I love how he custom 3D printed gloves for things so it looks like Iron Man's using them so looking at the whole setup I mean look at this dude this is just incredible I love how he built all the custom things like this hand the hands are really cool with Iron Man I think he did a really cool job with that the PC itself on this setup where is it this really really cool I love how it's custom painted to match the Iron Man theme it's like an Iron Man theme setup inside of a Marvel one so this is like the Spider-Man theme PC I love this I love how you did all the custom cables the custom sleeving on the AIO really cool custom paint on the case as well keyboard custom cases I don't know if you even used these or you painted them really insane dude the Spider-Man figure in the corner with all the lighting on it too and then the Shelf here as well coming down I just looking at this I love how you mounted your controllers on the wall too too right here you guys can't really see him cuz my camera but it's really really clean man all the keyboards here look at all that dude all the custom keyboard stands this is by far one of the coolest things I think I've ever seen the Spider-Man thing on the wall the lights on the ceiling all the cables are hidden this is by far the best setup I've ever seen honestly this is a 10 so this is William he is 12 years old he's a student out of Sweden and his main game is valerant Minecraft and fortnite uh his previous setup was just a crappy monitor and Xbox One and what inspired him to build this current setup is me Fallen Foe and low he afforded his setup by Saving on birthdays and Christmases to afford everything in the setup um his future plans for the setup is upgrading the PC specifically the GPU and power spot right off the bat he has a shelf above the setup he has Funko Pops about things he likes he like he has shoes that he likes candle he likes you know there's things about him that he likes also on the window cell we have a nice Lego set so it shows that he plays Lego or builds them and and enjoys them on top of that the PC looks really good as well also thank you for supporting the mouse pads and he's got the uh the keyboard and mouse there black and little hints of blue you guys got to understand 12 years old that is insane it's such an insane color scheme black and white very very minimal he's done his job and and able to make it exactly how he wants cable Management's good personality is solid I love the lights across the setup as well such a beautiful setup I would probably say this is a solid 9 .5 out of 10 this video is sponsored by guts.com my own mous Pad Company some of the setups in this video use our mouse pads so if you like what you see use the link down in the description to get one for yourself now back to the video so this is Kevin setup he's 17 years old and his occupation is he works part-time in retail he's located out in New Jersey and his main games are valerant ape R six and U which is dope he started building his his setup as a a passion project it looks like and he wanted to have a room that he could be comfortable in and express his personality which is dope it took him about 3 to 4 years to save up and build this setup he afforded this setup from birthdays Christmas money and working retail the retail job he said who helped him build the setup he did it all himself so that's pretty cool he's open to suggestions from chat and Aiden but I really am not anywhere near completion yet so right off of the bat I mean I just noticed how clean this was like this was the image I saw and I just was like okay I want to look de deeper into this setup I want to look deeper into this and see what personalities got I mean I love just the the peg boards to the [ __ ] light bars to the the amount of different animes and and different personality he's got I also love how like clean his desk is and also Cable Management as well from the setup on the right and the bed on the left and then they art throughout the room it's the same on the other side like all of this is such a cozy chill room and I think it's like very solid for his age also I love how minimal his key caps are and his like you know you know his Artisan pad with the with the G Pro super light I think it looks so awesome and then this is where I got really excited ITX PC I love seeing ITX builds in in cases like this I mean ITX builds are so Compact and they're super hard to build in so it's so cool to see one that's like doing what I would want you know and also I like your uh your pegboard has a lot of Personality shows your drawing shows you know your your different glasses you wear and your style also love the uh the goby light bars as well and you Cable Management with a uh with a Raceway which is so cool I feel like if this setup itself is beautiful I would say this is a solid eight the next setup is Paxton he is 15 years old out of um Arizona his occupation is a content creator which is interesting his main game is Modern Warfare 2 and valerant his previous setup was just a uh very bad desk and too many cables and no PC so now he's kind of just doing this what inspired him to build his current setup is he wanted something that he could work game and have nothing cluttered so he wanted a very organized Works Space and I think he achieved that here so far uh he built a setup for Consecration and for work and he built a setup about 2 months ago it took him entirety of two days to build the entire setup his brother helped him build his setup with the technical stuff the cable management Etc his future plan is a future plans is to buy a camera Sony a6000 with a 16 mm lens which is dope and then he wants to add another monitor for this setup man this already looks super solid so I'm really excited to take a look at what you got for us Cable Management very very solid very impressive love the raceways in front love how you've mounted the uh the power shrip there as well yeah so this double stack monitor I just love how clean and like clean this is I also love the PC as well all white build uh White Asus stricks motherboard and then also a 30 this looks like a 3060 maybe it's so awesome but overall I'd probably rate this to 7.5 uh the here is the next setup by Valentine he's 17 and he's a a student and a small content creator out of Germany his main games are valerant in Minecraft and his previous setup was just a really bad PC setup with cheap peripherals when started in the build his current setup right now is Tech Source GS and low so thank you um and what he built his setup for is Consecration and streaming he built the setup about 2 months ago and it took him about 2 years to build this exact setup in the way he wanted it he afforded it set up by streaming and delivering newspaper which is an interesting job I think he's doing a lot of this for the the Christmas theme with the green orange and then red and then you know stuff like that but I think normally it's blue and white I love where your your camera is it's like nice and minimal in between both monitors the plants kind of go in between and then you've like put the plants in really solid spots as well but yeah overall I love this setup if the color scheme was all normal I would say it's probably a 7.5 the next setup is is by Sam now this one has a lot of personality so get ready I love this setup off of the bat he is 17 years old and his occupation is going to school to be electrician he's located in Norway and his main games are Modern Warfare 2 and Rocket League his previous setup was just like a old TV and a PS4 that he wanted to get an actual space from what inspired him to build his current setup is setup Wars uh he built a setup for gaming work and school and he built the setup in August 2022 it took him about 5 to 6 a save up and actually get the style for this setup he afforded this setup by working in construction and other jobs over the summer breaks when he didn't have school for the electrician stuff and his dad helped him order parts and a little bit was setting up some stuff in the gaming stuff his future plans for the setup is to mount a light strip get some better double-sided tape for hanging his power chps underneath the desk and maybe just a different mouse pad off of the bat though I just love this color scheme I haven't seen this color scheme really used a lot recently nice little couch here as well got a white little uh GPU as well so so cool like from the theme to to the area to the placing it's so nice but yeah the the craziest thing is he's flexing on y'all bro just got an extra GPU on his desk straight up I also like that where his mic placement is I think it's great and also I love this color scheme man I feel like this color scheme is one of my favorites that I've seen on top of that your PC looks really solid I would say get some cable combs for your cables cuz they look a little scary but other than that everything else in your PC looks great I would say this is a probably a solid seven i b I think he's 15 he's 15 years old he's student out of Sir Lanka and his main game is fortnite and War Zone his previous setup was just a PS4 and what inspired him to build his current setup is me and Tech Source which is dope he uses his his setup for gaming racing and productivity he built the setup about 3 days ago he said it's 2 days so it took him about 2 days to put it all together and get it all put together that's so that's pretty dope that's pretty dope he afforded his set up by his SA and saving up over a couple years to get it and no one else really helped him build this entire setup and he did this by himself so that's pretty cool this is already really super solid like let's take a look into this a little bit and get a little bit of a deeper dive laptop setup on the left racing setup on the right very runof-the-mill which is really cool I've never seen a racing setem Sim like this um it's really nice I like to see that there's like all you have to do is like turn your chair and you're just right there like I feel like the usability of that is dope and you can literally just turn your chair and you're racing and then when you're ready to do some work you just turn back and I think that's that's such a unique way of doing things also cable manager is really solid by the way you've done a really good job of hiding your cables I like to see more personality in this setup uh when it comes to shelves and and maybe more things about you but for cleanliness cable management and like working with what you had um you did a great job seems like the the the chat consensus is 6 out of 10 uh this is Dennis he's a 13-year-old from Kansas he bought his setup from birthday money and his main game is valerant he built the setup to play games and study for school which took him around a whole year to fully upgrade and add everything okay bro okay bro what is this bro got the toilet paper roll in the setup bro that's crazy look at the mouse pad what in the what in God's name is going on he can take a [ __ ] without leaving the session respect okay dude come on yo I like the creativity in this setup man look at his mic holder Bros got it taped to a light look at that he's got the mic taped to the light bro I do like how you match your wallpapers to the thing on the back right um the speaker placement is okay I guess you know it it just seems very unuseful like you could probably like move a speaker further right if you didn't have this random mic holder here you know you could put the speaker where your toilet paper is if you know you got rid of that too looking at the cable management dude I can kind of see it from underneath here just get a Raceway it solve all your problems here overall I would just recommend like take everything out and start over reorganize you know recable manage use some raceways the PC looks good too man you got like a solid build going on so but overall it's not bad okay it's not bad it just needs some work it just needs some love you know what I'm saying I'll probably give it a solid three dude I'll give it a solid three you know you tried you got a decent setup great Foundation good PC I think you just need a little bit of love to the setup man whyatt setup he's a 12-year-old out of Georgia he's a student and his main games are Red Dead Redemption 2 and fortnite he built a setup for fun and he started a YouTube channel it took him around a year and a half to get everything to where it is now and he has an rk61 with an Atrix Mouse his monitors are Samsung ones upgrade soon and he built this PC with his dad here's a here's the specs for the PC looking out the rip here I mean [ __ ] okay the C management needs some work You' probably a Raceway would probably solve all your problems here it's a very nice setup though besides that I mean this could go you know like this could go a lot of cables underneath I would have say I would would say cable manage looking past the cable management we got a really nice setup on our hands regardless of the cable management though let's take a look we got personality out the wazu Spider-Man in the middle some lighting uh the monitor backgrounds I really like actually I think it matches the setup a lot overall I mean it's not bad you got a really solid foundation here dude the only thing I'd recommend is maybe mounting the monitors to a um to a stand I'd recommend getting two individual single ones and maybe doing uh one vertical one horizontal or both horiz Al but just make sure that they're more sturdy to the desk um but overall I mean it looks really nice man like this is just a beautiful setup I really like this man honestly I would probably rate this like a solid seven just because like the cable Management's not there it could have a little more personality but it does have more personality than most setups that I see for for 12 it's a really solid setup this is nahat uh he's a 13-year-old living in Vietnam mainly plays CS goo GTA 5 and FIFA uh uses a setup mainly for school work coding editing and gaming it took him around 3 years to save up and build everything he afforded all this by selling a CSO inventory on Lucky Money okay if I'm honest bro I I really want to see your csgo inventory I'm a big csgo inventory nerd chat knows this honestly I've never seen somebody use this yo wait this is kind of Genius yo bro bro doesn't want his bed to like like take out the light you know so what he does is he makes like a portable um a portable p board dude they go they clamp to the side of the desk that's actually sick and it like cuts it off from like the rest of the thing so he's got like a little mini wall next to him and then looking at the rest of the the the room here I like that actually a lot the printer the printer on top of the speaker is crazy um but the cable management is pretty good um you did pretty good like hiding the cables here looking at the this side of the setup I like this a lot man the only thing I'd recommend is maybe moving the PC a little farther to the right you know so you could have more mouse pad room the Shelf is nice with the personality up top and also the nanes are like perfect and this is a really nice setup for like you know straight run-of-the-mill man it's a one monitor setup very clean you know like I actually really like this I would rate this probably a solid eight man this is Max he's a 12-year-old from California his main games are fortnite and Modern Warfare 2 he built this setup uh to the stream make content play games and some school work bet it took him around 2 years to build this setup and here are his specs right here so looking off the B I mean it's just a nice white toppo setup here got the ga toppo okay okay also uh the cable management is a little whack I would like to see maybe mounting the power SHP underneath the bottom of the desk looking at the back of the setup a lot of cool posters in the back Attack on Titan looks like a Dragon Ball Z you know the keyboard and mouse nice little budget option there um but looking at the whole setup I mean it's nice I would say to change your Lighting on your PC to White if you can but yeah overall I mean it's not bad it could use a a little bit more personality right but looking at the setup itself I mean at least you got some posters on the wall and you got things that you like you know looking good I would say this is a PO a solid 7 out of 10 really clean uh just get some C better cable management and it will come out really clean this is ooad setup he's 13 but he turns 14 in October he's from Australia and he mainly plays Minecraft and rock League he built a set up for school work playing video games and content creation here's his YouTube it took him around one year to build his setup and here are his specs right here he afforded a setup by chores around the house and helping his dad with some garage door installs is this a loft bed setup again bro bro we get surprisingly a good amount of these bro I love loft bed setups dude really really chill you know two monitor setup here just looking at it off the bat really really good cable management and then underneath the bed I really like too I think that the bed setup's cool but what is this PC what is that it looks super odd shaped I I don't know um the mouse pad could do some work though that mouse pad is Tiny brother you have all this room too you could you could add a nice little mouse pad in there some good lighting you can add is maybe some [ __ ] Glides across the bottom um also maybe some more lighting underneath the desk like going down and underneath the Shelf adding a few of those things would make this setup just have a little bit more of that lighting now personality wise it's it's kind of hard cuz there's not a whole lot of um room in the setup to add things you know Mount stuff on this wall here this wall here there's a lot of different areas you can like post a little bit of things okay yeah yeah yeah I see it I see it now it's a laptop yeah it's a laptop behind there really clean too if you wanted you could make a third um a third monitor by taking this laptop and then mounting it like I did in the um the Intel laptop video and mounting it right here as a uh as the fourth Monitor and running the cables behind the monitors like that I think it's a I would probably say it's like a solid I would say like a solid six or S out of 10 I'm going I'm going to go s out of 10 I really like these um these under bed setups I really [ __ ] with them I think they're really cool this is Elliott a 13-year-old out of the United States he his occupation is chores so he's a younger kid uh his main games are Roblox and SP rocket chat I don't know what the hell SP rocket is please inform me anyway uh he built the setup uh to have better performance and it took him around 1.5 years to one and a half years to build this setup and um he afforded the setup by doing chores hand me- Downs laptop monitor where hand me- Downs as well as a microphone keyboard mouse and boom arm and he bought everything else with his own money looking at the setup man he's got a nice keyboard and what the [ __ ] is the mouse yo yo this mouse needs some work man cable Management's kind of rough around the edges you know I see you did try to like put some personality there you know I'd recommend decluttering taking all the cables out maybe mounting stuff underneath the bottom of the desk stuff like that it is it is a laptop setup I think it's an Asus Vivo book um I'd recommend maybe over some time save up and get a PC you know add all that but overall I mean it's you did what you could with you know the the room and space you have I'll give it to him you know he tried he tried for what he had you know um so I'd probably rate this a solid three out of 10 there's not really a way to add personality in this setup since it's in your living room but yeah it it's it's it's you know it's all right it's all right you know it could use some work though this is Dennis a 16-year-old out of Arkansas and his main game is Destiny 2 and Apex Legends his previous setup was a PlayStation setup and a very small desk and you can see that he's upgraded a lot since then he built this setup mainly for gaming and schoolwork and who inspired him to build this setup was me and Chris made their DIY videos and his occupation is that he works for a local minor league baseball team so Dennis is setup right off of the bat I just love the personality and the way that you went about this setup from from the lighting in the setup to the diffuse RGB on the desk and the organization this is pretty insane man um I love the shelves as well the you really stuck true to that blue theme that you have as well and this is a actually really nice setup cable management is really good as well RGB looks good PC's lifted off the carpet that's amazing as well the shelves and the personality is there also love the placement of this this uh like the Xbox the plant everything just seems really aligned and really clean um I also like how you put the the border around like the gloves and the um the Miller Jersey and I think you said in your submission that you're going to put a little bit of a like a mic arm and then um some things like that what I would recommend as well is maybe a Raceway like a wall Raceway for the cables coming down here maybe getting a little bit longer cables you know making them go straight down that way it kind of gets hidden below the desk other than that man there's really not a whole lot to say I mean you did a great job with cable management personality is on point lighting's on point and you also did this all unique since you did this custom lighting here and uh honestly I I don't even know what to say to this man I think this is a solid 9.5 out of 10 I think this is an amazing setup this is gal a 12-year-old out of pen and his main games are rust Roblox and GTA wow what a lineup it took him about 2 years to build this entire setup and his old setup was just an Xbox on a desk since he's 12 years old he does not have a job so he does chores to earn money for his setup to build this gaming setup he was inspired by Tech Source me and conville and who helped him complete this setup is his dad built everything you see in the setup and his mom gave him a lot of design ideas for it w parents looking at this right off of the bat here I mean the mouse pad's super small one of the those uh knockoff temu ones I mean overall it's not a bad setup I just feel like there's a lot of things that are just placed in the wrong spot the biggest thing I think right now is uh that what could help the setup is not using one Mount to hold both monitors I did this in my blow video and I kind of explained why every monitor on its own stand and the reason for this is that when you put them both on one stand it creates this Lean Forward effect stability of the whole setup becomes very bad so I'd recommend maybe getting a second Vivo mount and putting one either vertically or just separating a little bit from the monitor because it creates this like lean forward and it's too heavy to put both monitors on there and it creates it to like be a little bit harsher um what I'd also recommend is a Raceway that just goes right in between this monitor here to hide the cables from the monitor to the to the PC because the PC is on the desk anyway so honestly you could just put all the wires together uh and put a Raceway right here to the right and it would be completely hidden for personality sake I do like the shells I think the pegboard is cool I see the idea the vision you're going for but it does need a little bit better execution when it comes to like maybe adding more stuff in the other sides of the walls I feel like everything's kind of condensed to one area I would have done um two thinner Peg boards on this wall like this and I would have maybe made one longer shelf and one shorter shelf just to make it like look kind of cool but what you did with this works as well I just think it needs more to it and honestly I mean it's a great setup uh I'd probably rate this a solid I'm going to rate a solid 6 out of 10 I think he did a great job this is Jack a 13-year-old streamer located out of Michigan his main game is Apex Legends and he also streams it his previous setup was just a Xbox One S and old TV so he's upgraded a lot since then he finished this build around February of this year and it's taken him around a whole year to build the setup he afforded this set up by mowing lawns and from his parents giving him money on Christmas and birthdays off the bat I I'm just kind of noticing everything everywhere I'm just kind of noticing everything everywhere if I'm honest it seems very um seems very cluttered in a way like just looking at it straight up people say these Signum racks work but in actuality they really don't I hate these things for K management I think they're one of the worst things ever invented I think the,

and it took him around 10 months to get it where it's at he paid for the setup all by himself from summer jobs and helping his parents and he built everything by himself okay wait wait wait okay I like this picture okay okay bro yeah we let him cook too much we let him cook too much bro what is Bud doing what is bro he's got the grippers out dude all right so looking at this setup I mean the cable management could be better obviously right but it seems like it's a budget setup so it seems like you just kind of threw everything if if I if it were me I would say this Wall's a little plain and I'd love to see you add more but I'm assuming you're in your saving for your PC Arc so I can't like complain um but overall I mean this is not a bad setup for 14 I mean you got the Xbox for games the Xbox series s is a really good Xbox I mean it's a good console you can still play keyboard and mouse but you also have a laptop so you can play maybe some games there or something but overall I mean you did a pretty good job I mean this is really nice aesthetically uh and the desk itself is good it's nice and big you can use a you can probably put a PC on it later on you did really good with the foundation but yeah I would say cable management is one of the big issues for me and also like um how plain the wall is but for 14 this is really nice I would give it a solid six I think I agree with chat this is Brad he's 14 and he's from the UK he doesn't have any main games at the moment but he plays a lot of GTA he build it for gaming and productivity took him around a month to get it where it's at now but he's had the PC for around 3 years and he just stopped using it for a while all right he afforded this setup by selling old stuff he didn't need and helping family with work and he built it all by himself okay cool a lot of things I'm planning on upgrading like a new pc gut a mouse pad another 27 in Monitor and adding some wall mounts okay yeah so then looking at this whole setup I mean like to see the PC there I I think honestly the the layout of the setup is good I like how you stuck your PS5 kind of right underneath there that's a good spot for it everything that you did in this setup is right it just I think the wall mounts would help a lot Hal management could be a little better but you did your best for the most part PC could have some upgrades but you still have a decent PC it looks like the personality is a little lacking for sure personality is lacking a little bit but I'm assuming you're going to mount some of these monitors and stuff so what i' recommend is you're if you're keeping this theme like this I would recommend to mount one monitor straight on and I'd recommend to mount another monitor further to the right because right now the way the way that you have it set up you kind of like have to look directly at each screen you know you have to go like this and it's kind of it's kind of weird and awkward so to combat that you need to mount each monitor straight one straight on and one kind of to the side or one above or something like that one above would probably be the best for this I yeah I'd probably give it a solid six Foundation is good all he needs is more personality and maybe some reorganization my setup used to be a couch and TV setup about 3 years ago before I got my first gaming desk and first quote unquote setup I noticed on Tech talk and lockdown and I got inspired for some tech talkers and setups and setup Wars also helped me with a lot of Inspirations for my setup I bought my first ever PC by fishing crabs with my dad and we sold them that's an interesting profession I've done this for a couple years now and every time we sell we earn about $1 to $150 so I'm planning on getting a third mon and I'm actually getting a mini for as well for the setup tomorrow also plan on adding some man and Goby Glides in the near future also probably some vertical mounting my GPU I use my setup to watch your streams watch YouTube make content for my Tik Tok as well and play games with my friends wow for 14 this is already great so let's take a look through the pictures here this is wow this is really nice for 14 this is crazy overall I really love the aesthetic of the setup you've got going on there's a few things I would change though for the most part you've done a great job the lighting the Aesthetics the K management a lot of it is great I don't think it's a 10 and there's a few reasons why it's a great setup you've done a great job for your age I love your hard work ethic and on top of that you've done a really great job but the one thing I would say is again your your obviously your chair is one a red chair and a purple setup I mean not much you can really do about that but over time if you save up you could swap out the chair I love the shelves and the personality you've got going but I feel like this shelf right here is isn't centered with the setup I just feel like the symmetry of the setup gets really thrown off when there's this extra spot that just like open with nothing in it and it's like you got this entire setup it looks insanely good and then the Shelf just doesn't reach the entire way so either you can get a longer shelf or Center this one and I think it would make this setup look a lot better if I were to rate this setup I would say this is 9 out of 10 you wanted to create a setup that was clean it was also just a happy place for me to unwind I also wanted to have a project while I saved up for a PC I I it set up like this is very clean and I worked with the layout of my room I afforded this set up by working in a concession stand for volleyball tournament my future plans to get a desk shelf and a new desk mat look how clean this Xbox setup is like come on Bros 13 this is insane for a 13-year-old the aesthetic the way that he built this setup out for a console setup this is insane I love the way that this looks I love the wood with the orange and blue hints accents to the entire setup you know I think you did an insane job like just the aesthetic you got going on I really love from the plants and the the light wood and then on top of that your even your your frames for your pictures match you have a pegboard that matches the same color of the wood like the attention to detail in this setup is insane obviously I love the little key cap set as well I think he did a great job the mouse pad yes could use an upgrade you know where to go but I I like do I even dare say this is a 10 out of 10 I mean like the cable management isn't the best you know like it's not like insane but like the the minimalism on this setup is is insane like tending to detail like the way that you did everything like I just can't find anything wrong with it I love it the only thing I could complain about is this Black Cube but I know that they don't make them in the same wood the black accents with this works the CBL would be the only thing that I would say like I would complain about but you did a great job hiding them behind your monitor too you know what make this even cleaner is if you mounted this monitor which I don't if you can do you're also 13 but for 13 this is an incredible setup man you did a great job do not think that you did bad at any way but I love this setup bro you did a great job overall you did a great job I think I love the aesthetic wood with the blue and the orange I think just compliment the setup very well like this just looks insane even wrapping your Xbox a different color maybe some orange and blue like maybe this you know like would look nice on the Xbox but for the most part you're trying to build a PC so for this setup I would probably rate this 9.9 the only .1 I would take away would be for this Cable Management it's not even that bad first setup was ugly L with one monitor first gen Xbox my setup is currently like this since what a and I were able to come up with G aen sponsored the build with majority of the PC setup as well while I've been off work and home more plans of the future including adding more wall art and upgrading some PC component this is it so this is uh it's actually my cousin's setup I think Joey setup is like perfect I know you guys you can see it from this side but this is like a waste underneath the K man's really organized it doesn't look as organized as it is but it is again you know we have his his Astro on the left side with with his headset hanger here and then like his controller hanger here as well and then the cable goes across cuz he plays with a cable and overall I think it's it's really good like the cable management you guys can see like we have a Raceway there a hub here for plugging in different stuff and then also you know different things like that I think Joey's setup's really great what do you guys think chat you guys would rate this one out of 10 what do you guys think I mean for the most part for his setup and like his aesthetic he's building I feel like he's done a great job solid eight yeah I think it's a solid eight or nine the only thing that I would recommend is this wall just feels a little empty which he knows that I think he's going to put like shelves or um some different wall art and stuff like that in my opinion I would rate this probably an 8.5 or yeah an 8.5 out of 10 I could have done a little bit better with the K management below the monitors as well but for the most part I love the aesthetic he's got going on and I think he did a great job I started my setup when I was around 13 to 14 years old it was really really plain and pretty bad in general I saw all the potential in my setup looking at videos on YouTube so I decided it was time to upgrade and start putting in some work on my setup the way I afforded this St I was going to work with my dad over the summer on weekends my plan for the future is to buy a bigger desk like a Salen countertop or some Alex Shores and get the Topo white mouse pad which I'm actually rocking First Impressions I really like this setup right off the rip ooh little bit of skill management okay but overall like this is pretty nice I love the aesthetic of the PC already like you said you needed a new desk so I'm not going to rip you a new one for that yes you do need a new desk your desk is on life support you do need a desk so yeah that'll be an upgrade you'll probably get soon but what I will say is your aesthetic isn't bad it's just a symmetry so like the two speakers and then the two plants just don't aesthetically fit there it just feels a little off and crammed and cluttered like the clock is nice but like putting both of these plants there feel out of place so what I'd recommend is maybe removing these two plants and centering the clock with the Monitor and centering both of these speakers left and right that way it doesn't feel over the top obviously when you get your new desk you could probably Center this all so I'm not going to dock you on that but I think maybe spacing this out just a little bit more and centering this with the first monitor might help the symmetry of the wall he said you're in between color schemes so I'm not going to like hold you to that but when you get the uh new mouse pad I would love to see a black and white contrasty set up on this all the lights Chang from purple to White I think would look insane especially since your PC is all black and white which that was good future proofing so yeah I I think you did a great job besides the K management like you said you're going to get a new desk so I wouldn't go through and K manage everything quite yet maybe get a new pow ship as well when you go to a new cable manage get a very long a way longer one and stuff like that but when you get to get your new setup then you can cable manage this a lot some things I would recommend is watching my cable management video where I go through like all the products you should buy and things you you should and shouldn't buy cuz I feel like it it has a lot of advice in it I think you did a really good job of showing personality as well like you know we can see you play soccer and we see you know different stuff like that like Disney in some way and then on top of that you're a winner all guts aen viewers are winners just just letting you know in my opinion I would say this is a solid seven I think it's got usability It's Great the only thing that holds the setup back is the set like the actual desk itself and overall I think that that you did a great job for what the space you had you just need a new desk once you get the new desk I feel like it's going to open up your setup a lot holy [ __ ] my name is Gage or gtpc is on social media I'm 14 years old and I made some tech content I get sponsorship deals as my source of income I'm located in Texas and I don't game much but when I do it's fortnite or Rainbow Six Siege I fored this setup from advertising reviewing Tech products on Tik Tok and I built all this setup with my dad who helped me put together my outex draes my shelf and the stuff above the setup holy [ __ ] this is beautiful this is beautiful for 14 love the shelf on the right with the keyboards oh my gosh 14 man so looking at the setup right the theme he has going is very impressive I love how it's kind of like off-white and stuff but it's got like some nice hype Beast culture in it but I love how he built like this this kind of like thing around it you know what I'm saying like one sides controllers one sides keyboards I I do also think if you can do something with like up top of here like some plants or something like that and I think you should also get one more controller so you can make these even I can't even complain keyboard and mouse com looks really nice the PC looks beautiful he has a better setup than me chat like but yeah overall dude I think it's insane you did a really good job with this I would rate this a 10 out of 10 I'm going to give it a 10 out of 10 I I think it's beautiful this is car DTM he's a 15-year-old out of the UK and he's a student his main game is fortnite cod Minecraft Swami's aot fan game and that's his main games he plays uh the set took him around 9 months to get all the money for it approximately 1,200 lb he afforded this through birthdays Christmases jobs like cleaning cars working for his grandpa as well okay looking at the setup it's just mad cluttered how much school workor are they making you do is this really how much paper they give you is this how much they waste in school man we got technology now put it on put it on a Google doc get rid of all that [ __ ] looking at this though I'm I really do like the the Shelf in the middle I think it's kind of cool that you showed all kinds of different personality through that but it definitely needs some decluttering for sure I would have liked to see some things hung up on the walls more like the sword the swords and stuff looks cool as hell why don't you put that on the on the wall excuse me also the cable management here could be a little bit better and overall I would probably give this a solid six this is David he's a 13-year-old and he just moved to Maryland a few weeks ago I saved up money for the past 5 years to come to this and here are the specs as well and things he uses so looking at the setup the lights I don't know what you're doing with the lights all right the rgb's got to go it doesn't make any sense like what is even going on here but looking at the whole setup I mean it has a lot of potential I love the uh the panels on the back of the wall here I just think the LEDs you did were kind of corny and they they they don't really serve any purpose the PC is built actually really well overall I do think you should get rid of the rgbs and maybe do something a little bit more like the goie lights maybe I also think that maybe moving this monitor slightly down to where the bezel is hidden would be better too but overall I mean it's not bad at all I think this is a really solid setup I think that the kill management does need work it has a really solid foundation but until everything's fixed in my opinion I would probably give it a solid 5.5 all right this is Gio he's a 23-year-old College shent from Florida and his main games are Apex Legends OverWatch 2 Modern Warfare 3 war zone 2 and GTA he also sometimes plays FIFA on his Xbox as well he built a setup for gaming and schoolwork and he started building the setup last September to get it to where it's at now all the hexagons are made out of cardboard ooh okay okay his mom and his girlfriend got him some things for the setup and other than that that's the stuff I bought wait wait wait this is kind of cooking okay the K manid is a little a little messed up so looking at the setup as a whole when I look at this I'm like wow the color scheme the the way you did the monitors the way you mounted them the speaker placement the lighting on the left I love how you did this around the little mini peg board with the the controllers and I I do think your cable Management's kind of bad but in the most part you could actually just get one big Raceway you put one of them on there and it hides like 90% of your cables um perfs look good the lighting looks good in it as well and then looking at the shelves I think I I love the personality the plants the the way you did custom made uh these hexagon panels and stuff I would probably rate this a solid 8.5 this is diux he's a 14-year-old student out of the Netherlands and he mainly uses a setup for homework Epic Games and Minecraft with friends this took around 4 years to build it's probably around $2,200 except for mounting the monitor arm I did by myself and it took around 7 to 10 hours to build everything it's a beautiful setup dude ta management is beautiful the speaker placement is decent love how you put the laptop on the right side so it's hidden what a beautiful setup for 14 you guys can't even complain this is beautiful man the plant is perfectly placed the only thing I can complain about is the mouse pad bro minus one just joking I'm just joking Ed I'm just joking I'm going to give it a nine the only thing I don't like about it is a chair and more personality but overall like this is beautiful and clean minimal it's nice uh this is toast he's a 14-year-old and he lives in Canada his main games are Minecraft Roblox and cod he built a setup by himself and he was inspired by gutsy Aiden oh damn bro thank you man makes you feel all warm inside his specs are all this stuff you can take a look at it if you'd like and let's take a look at the setup itself what a beautiful PC too oh my goodness a little little little slight little little productivity setup on the left side on the right side okay so looking at it I mean there's not a single Cable in sight this is just one of the the best setups I've seen here this is such a clean setup man holy water cooled insanely nice love the fans love how you did this so one thing I'd recommend is maybe if you want a microphone I think you might use the Astro so you don't really like care about it that much but maybe some sort of microphone the keyboard and mouse you could change it up mouse pad is really really small actually I would recommend just a bigger mouse pad uh even the beds made perfect it's really clean I'm going give it a solid N9 out of 10 I think it's good I do want to see more personality though this is Osman a 14-year-old out of Australia the land down under right now he's in school he does occasionally go out with my dad to install and Service Garage Doors W his main game is rocket league and he built a setup because he wanted to place to chill and make content for YouTube it took him around one year to get to where it's at now and he plans to keep adding to it and he's currently building a PC and it isn't complete yet okay his dad uh built the loft bed and assisted with some other things as well in the setup okay I'm looking at I mean looking at this it's so close to being done man see that would that would just make me so mad bro if I had a PC like this this damn beautiful already and I'm like I just can't use it that'd be the the biggest blue ball ever bro I do love how you put the monitor mounts like this I love the cable management too I love how you cut holes to fit the cables through beautiful idea really nice actually also love the little mini shelf on the left and underneath the loft is really clean I would recommend some more lighting underneath this like if you could get some [ __ ] like the [ __ ] rope lights and stuff like that may put in across and underneath the bed just to light up the bottom would be really really cool but yeah overall I think this is a beautiful setup for for what it's worth and once your PC's done it'll look even better so I would I would probably give it a a solid 7.5 it's really nice it's clean it's a really good beautiful setup this is Matan he's a 15-year-old from Israel and he started building this setup for 3 years and he will upgrade it again in a few months he's been playing fortnite valant and Rocket league and he's been building the setup from his birthday money and saving up from the holidays he has to order RGB strips and new monitor light bar he wants to upgrade his chair to a new one as well PC looks good from the first glance honestly looks pretty good I think the one thing I would say though is like yeah I I would I I just questioned why you put the the power strip on the right side of the Alex Shore that was my only my only concern is why did you put this over here when you could have like kind of put this right above this and then all these cables be like right next to each other you could have mounted it like above this Signum rack and then made it a little bit more clean also I feel like you do feel a little cluttered this PC seems like it be better on the floor if I'm being completely honest with you maybe on the floor or move the desk off a little bit of the wall and put it in between overall it's a it's a decent setup I I'd probably give it a solid 6.5 out of 10 I think there's more personality to be made and also decluttering like basically reorganization of the setup would help out a lot he's 13 years old and his occupation is chores breaking and shoveling driveways he's located out in New York and his main games are rocket league in fortnite but inspired him to build this current setup is my videos and wanting to create content on YouTube and he built this setup for gaming school work and content creation he built this setup after Christmas and it took him about 3 years to save up for everything you see in the setup what are the some of the brand names of his setup he's got goby light his his PC is an HP Pavilion and he's running a Kyron V1 keyboard glorious Modelo and creative pedable speakers which you guys can see here K management is tidy we like to see a Raceway not a huge deal though love it it's a very very solid start what do you guys think about this out of 10 I think this is personally like a solid six or no a solid seven out of 10 I would say this video is sponsored by guts.com my own mous Pad Company some of the setups in this video use our mouse pads so if you like what you see use the link down in the description to get one for yourself now back to the video next one is Michael setup he is 13 years old and he has no occupation but he's also located in Florida his main games are Modern Warfare 2 and Rocket League PC has an i7 3700k and a 4080 he's also running the fractal design meshify 2 in white and he's running his first monitor at 1440p with 174 70 HZ vertical monitor at 240 HZ what help him build the setup is YouTube and learning how to build a PC from there uh the setup overall out of 10 what do you guys think yeah I would say it's as a solid seven I mean it's it's really really clean you know this is Dominic setup he's 14 years old and he wants to do unboxing videos to grow his Tik Tok he's located out of Las Vegas and his main game is cod his previous setup was ram my Xbox One in a small TV and when inspired in to build this current setup is MADD K he built the setup like a year ago and it took him about one or two years to save up and get everything in this setup future plans with this setup is to inspire people to do more stuff and unboxing videos I mean this is such a sick setup for I mean 14 years old this is really cool yeah I love this man already off the bat I love the uh the wall panels also I love the little the pedals in between like the theme on this setup is beautiful for 14 years old this is probably one of the best like themed setups I've ever seen David setup now he's 16 years old he's a student out of working out of a warehouse in the summertime and he's located out of Canada uh on Ontario his main games are Modern Warfare 2 forizon 5 and GTA what inspired him to build his his his setup is a Crea a space where he'd be able to relax make a good time and also do some homework or edit videos and photos his keyboard is a gmmk pro also a KD fans tiger 80 and a razor Viper ultimate which is docked on his desk here for audio he's running a baringer umc22 and a um2 he's also running a dm1 dynamite for microphone and preamp and then his displays are an Asus Rog 49 which is at the top his main monitor is a Dell s222 which is a 240 HZ monitor the side monitor is an Acer 32 in that he only uses for pretty much Discord and Spotify his PC specs as well ryzen 75800 X and A 370 I love the monitors I love the layout you're kind of working with here as well in my opinion I think this is a solid seven 7.5 next setup is by Gabriel he's 14 years old and he is a student and he works as a butcher he's located in Australia and his main games are valerant rocket league and Call of Duty war zone what inspired him to build this current setup is low Tech Source and me and he built the setup for gaming homework and studying he built the setup in 2020 and it took him about 2.5 years to save up and build everything uh the PC is in the case be quiet pure 5 500d running a 2070 and an i79700 K has a 850 W gold power supply and a gigs of RAM and then his keyboard is an eom maker th80 with a G Pro super light in white and then his mouse pad is a by the mouse pad company Also let's take a look at the cable management cable management is very close to being like perfect just these few cables could be pressed up a little bit I love this I think this is really really solid so looks like we got a winner in our chat I'm sure he subscribed because winners are subscribers just saying but overall the setup looks great I mean you done a great job at your age man Mr Roy Rory uh Rory Rory he's 17 years old and he's a part-time worker at a store he's from New Zealand and his main game is war zone 2 and fortnite the one inspired him to build his current setup is Cath and slush and he built a setup primarily for gaming but he also uses it for school which is media class involves editing and making short films he built the setup in early 201 22 and Gathering parts for the last 3 years it took him about a year to build this entire setup and he afforded the setup by saving up from half his paycheck for each week really clean right off of the bat I like the blue and white color theme I like that you put the G feel that matches the same like the Raging gummy fish like the the the thing kind of looks like it matches the the theme as well which is kind of cool I also like your M mic placement too I forgot to say that but I really like your mic placement overall 6.5 7 I I would personally rate this like a 6 .5 this is Preston setup now he is 14 years old and he does not have an occupation he's located out of Michigan and his main game is fortnite previous setup was a smaller desk and a really bad laptop and then he upgraded to a PC so it was time to change everything what inspired him to build his current setup is watching my videos of other setups and his brother has a setup as well so his PC specs is an rx4 62 gig by gigabyte Intel i5 6400 2.7 GHz a ram 16 GB and his PSU is a thermal take 500 watt as well with a motherboard that is an ECS LGA 1151 and then if we look at the the keyboard and mouse he's running a red dragon is keyboard and then the mouse is a razor death at in white he afforded it set up by doing neighborhood jobs saving that money from christas Christmas and birthdays let's take a look at everything I mean overall this is really nice I mean CH if we can remember again he's 14 years old so I really do love this under bed setup here I I think he's done a great job also K manant could be a little better you know that's kind of thought about but I think overall I'd probably say like a seven out of 10 all right uh this is Juan he is 14 years old and his occupation is school he's located out of the United States and his main game is Apex Legends what inspired him to build this current setup is friends and gutsy Aiden he built a setup for gaming and editing took him 3 months to build this entire setup and save up for it so let's go ahead and take a look at his keyboard and mouse here he's running a Corsair k70 Mark I and the Corsair headset and a Modelo of the wall um he afforded this set up by saving up and his his uncle helped him build a PC and he did the rest love the bed by the way let's take a look at the room I mean I love the bed like with the GOI glide on the wall love that think it's really unique um also I love the the foam plus the panels I think it's very interesting I also like how you cut it out around your shelf and then put lighting up there maybe a smaller keyboard too cuz you have no room on your desk at all I think personally this is probably like maybe I want to say like a like a 6.5 chat's kind of on the same the same thought as me this is Carter he's from Georgia he's in eighth grade at an amazing school and I hope you rate my setup at least a 4 out of 10 one downside is I use an Xbox and my main game is Call of Duty I built my setup because I love gaming with friends and it's taken over a year to build this and I love it I use an Asus monitor razor mouse and a Logitech keyboard I afforded this by doing chores and work around the house and I built my setup on my own okay I don't think that Xbox setups are bad I think that Xbox setups have a lot of potential if they're done right in this opinion I I feel like I feel like it's not bad the setup is pretty decent the only the only thing that I would recommend is Cable Management which you literally have a bar you can hide it on if you just cable manage a little bit it'd be great and for this Xbox setup it's like it's not bad you got like a USB hub you got like the whole Mount I think that's pretty cool the controllers I would have liked to see in the actual charging thing but overall it's actually pretty nice dude I mean this is this is a pretty Sol solid setup there not a lot of Personality which like is fine I would say probably like I would give this a solid 6 out of 10 not bad for just a year on Shore money I agree yeah Cloud setup he's a 13-year-old out of Minnesota and his main game is valerant and fortnite he built the setup because he wanted to do Tech videos and also get more serious into YouTube it took him around 2 to 3 years to build this setup and here are some of the brand named stuff he uses in his setup I afforded this setup by chores saving money from birthdays and Christmases who helped him build the setup me and texor all right bet the first thing I would notice is the laptop setup I mean it's not bad that you have a laptop because that's fine um and I see you did attempt to Cable manage on the left side which is good I would have said to mount the laptop maybe up behind one of the monitors or on the desk or just on the right side of this over here that way it's not in the way right here I mean like you see all these cables coming down you can mount them on the back of this and maybe run the laptop on the back of this in case it's not bad overall I think that moving that around would be your best option I do like the mount for the for the mic placement I also like the speaker placement I think that's good too the only problem about this monitor is how far right it is I feel like you got like you're playing your game and then you're like you know overall it's not bad you know and for your first like one of your first setups like this is pretty solid you have enough space uh your laptop all that you can build it up a little bit it'll take a little time but you definitely get build it up a little more overall really really clean I would probably give it a solid seven I think I thin",

mean it is but it isn't right I feel like you could have done such a better job at just organizing the the consoles it being in front of your screen like that I don't really like if I'm honest I would say what I what I would recommend is maybe getting uh like on the side of your dresser right here pulling the dresser closer putting both of the consoles up there and running the cables down and over you know what I'm saying and then youd have more room and then maybe you can even Mount this TV to the wall right there too and it would look a lot cleaner um but I really recommend uh cable managing this a little better overall chat I mean what do you guys think I I don't know if I'm honest I would probably rate this pretty low I'd probably say it's a 2.5 out of 10 I feel like you just popped the TV on a table put both the consoles in and plugged it in like it wasn't there wasn't a lot of effort or thought into this all right this is David he's a 15-year-old from Vietnam but currently living in Australia his main games are FIFA online 4 cross and Crossfire Legend it took him around 8 months to build a setup and he afforded the setup by working in a restaurant and in a farm and he built it all by himself cable Management's really good mounted uh power strip here cables ran across a little Raceway action honestly it's pretty good it's pretty good for a laptop setup dude you know what I'm saying chat it's pretty good for just a laptop setup like it's very simple it's it's nice it's clean for a laptop setup I I think the only thing obviously it lacks is the personality on the wall but it seems like he's not there for a long time so it seems like he just kind of set this up and just made it to look like you know a temporary type of nice looking setup but it gets the job done I feel like you can game on this effectively I feel like you know it it's nice and straight to the point I'd rate this a 7.5 out of 10 honestly I I honestly think it'd be dope as a 7.5 out of 10 looks good thank you brother uh this is Lucano Lucano oh I said your name right uh this is L Lano he's a 16-year-old living in the UK but he's Argentinian his main games are rocket League Cod and fortnite and it took him around 4 years to save up and build to the setup now uh he fored this by working for his parents grandparents business and some birthday money uh he built the set up all by himself and here are some of the specs and the things he has I by the way I know the cable management is bad sorry it doesn't really bother me though as I'm always using my setup at night Bros got the grippers out calm down yo Bros got the grippers out looking at the setup I mean I mean yeah it's not bad I feel like this monitor takes up so much of your mouse pad room but I mean it's not that bad since you have the keyboard on that side the only thing is is just like I feel like the monitors kind of overtake the desk so a way to kind of fix this is maybe move the the the mic over to the left get two um individual monitor mounts and then you know maybe back them up as far as you can being in front of a window it might be kind of hard to to mount anything but yeah I'd also read maybe maybe one Alex dra on one of the sides cuz I like a regular Ikea table is very unsturdy with just legs oh yeah you already have one okay I'm tripping but I would recommend putting your PC on the on the L on the alextra side cuz like this can cause Boe and stuff like that yeah Kale man can obviously be you know improved upon it isn't terrible but it could you know it could be better for sure I I I would rate this probably a solid I'd rate this probably a solid 5.6 overall it's not terrible but it's not insane so anyway thank you for submitting it looks good 16-year-old not bad this is burrow a 16-year-old located out of the United States he used to play fortnite and Terraria but now he mainly uses it for homework he built the setup cuz he wanted a better gaming experience and he built the PC in a day but he's been upgrading his keyboard and mouse since then he bought and sold game in-game items for crypto to afford this setup and he tried to minim minimize the amount of things needed on his desk like exess cables and accessories here are the things that he has uh in his PC and everything like that is brother in the dining room brother brother your setup is in the dining room brother bro specs are nice though yeah bro got the setup with getting the setup he has all the stuff to make a nice setup but just is is in the middle of his dining room oh wait a minute wait a minute chat we're not thinking what he never has to leave his setup his mommy brings him food dude this is wait maybe this is a th000 IQ play he doesn't have to leave sorry for flaming you Bro you've got the you've got the play on us on a real note the PC is actually very nice though um but overall bro I definitely think you got to like like in an all serious note you definitely you definitely got to move the monitor okay you've got to you got to move the you got to move your setup back in your room or something okay I would probably rate this like a solid five out of 10 I mean it's like there's it's just a setup you know it's just a functional setup I mean at least you can play games let's be real brother has better mouse pad room than the last setup we just saw you know what I'm saying this is Michael um he's a 14-year-old and he doesn't work anywhere he lives in East uh East Easter Pennsylvania he plays fortnite some rocket league and Apex and he buildt the setup so he could have a better performance on video games and also make it look cool it took around one year to do it all and he's still upgrading little things here and there and he used guts A's and mouse pad NZXT Amazon Logitech Etc here's his PC specs right here he has a 4k monitor damn he has a better monitor than me uh he afforded it by Christmas birthdays and other holidays and no one helped them with the setup thank you uh looking at it I mean two monitor setup PC nice Cable Management nice little shelf in the in the angle there nice setup but the other guy wins okay buddy calm down table management looks pretty good the Shelf has nice personality up there the lighting in the room's pretty cool too chat what do you guys think about this is this actually pretty good this is actually pretty good see I think it would be so cool in a corner in a corner like this to have like a a [ __ ] Glide go like a curve here you know I think I've never seen anybody do that like a [ __ ] Glide starting starting here turning and then being here and ending here you know what I'm saying I think it'd be really cool to do something like that okay but he has to walk out to get food bro God chat's never going to let that guy go man chat's never going to forget about that guy man uh I would probably rate this an8 out of 10 if I'm honest I think it looks really good what's going on with the mouse Department here Brothers got the the Eva from um from wall bro no ain't no way brother uh this is Hank's setup he's a 14-year-old uh from the Netherlands he works in a store and his main game is war zone and fortnite he built the setup cuz he wanted to place to relax and play games and it took him around 2 years to piece everything together here are his specs for his PC keyboard and mouse all the monitors Etc and he afforded the set up by working his job and birthdays his dad uh his dad and his mom helped him build his setup w right off the bat I really like this setup man I think like the way that you built the background is so clean so nice dude like looking at looking at like like this image right here I really really like the the light across the setup it's really clean I also think your kale management you did is is really nice too also like the shelves on the left side that looks good too yeah but look at the whole room I mean they did a really good job of making this wall like really clean yeah it looks so nice the PC looks good too I think he did a great job also I really like the backgrounds matching the the mouse pad and all of that yeah it looks really clean it's not a bad setup I think you did a great job with designing the room um I really like the light in the middle it looks really really clean I think you did a great job I I'd probably rated a solid N9 out of 10 I think everything else is really solid though okay Kyle setup looks amazing already curly going to school come a mechanic and we did this so we did mechanic work to to afford this setup Geometry Dash okay that's a w game W game all that for Geometry Dash is crazy though okay cool so it he also was inspired by Instagram setups interesting okay cool okay previous setup you know pretty bad PC specs there new pc looks awesome though oh my gosh look at the colors on that thing it's amazing I love the everything on that PC okay so his father helped him fund a few things in this setup interesting okay this is giving me younger Vibes but older Vibes as the setup oh gosh we got we got to guess okay oh what do you guys think how old do you guys think Kyle is it's a really nice setup though like oh my gosh chat's saying 17 so I'm going to guess my guess is 16 I'm locking in 16 damn dude oh come on man okay we're not we're not we didn't win that one all right on to the next one this is Brandon setup oh my gosh all right a really nice setup off the rib um okay he's a student okay and he makes EXT extra cash while mowing lawns okay old setup was a clunky laptop and 60 Herz monitor with a low desk okay so he's basically rebuilt his whole setup now um so it's current games Modern Warfare 2 okay I'm I'm thinking younger here Sky long keyboard at budget keyboard and a budget Mouse so I'm assuming still like 15 14 thank you for saying that I'm your inspiration that's awesome thank you honestly it looks really solid I love this black and white color scheme it's amazing PC looks pretty good too honestly pretty nice looking PC chat what are we thinking on this age I kind of think he's like 14 okay my guess is 14 from everything we saw with mowing laws he's a student it's probably sometime in middle school or or maybe first year high school I'm going to guess 14 that's my guess dang it man that was a year off ah that was a dude it's still insane it's still an insane setup thank you so much Brandon for submitting that setup okay so Sasha this setup is still really nice it did really well um as a video idea this one was really good she's running a console setup as well and a PC so student um uses for setup for gaming watching TV and schoolwork previous setup was an M1 MacBook and two Dell monitors so I like the racing Sim as well and also I love the stons meter on top of the the you know up here looks like stons uh but looks really good sold M1 Mac but kind of a smart decision if you want a gaming setup though also the PC looks very similar to mine if you guys remember my last PC build this looks very similar to my PC woo it works it works I okay I'm going to guess 14 with this setup I think this has got to be a 14-year-old setup for sure I'm going to go 14 what 12 bro for this being a 12-year-old setup this is amazing wow what an amazing setup that's crazy for 12 years old um this is Mike setup okay let's take a look from Germany okay take a look rocket league is the main game he plays okay okay like black and white setup here with a little yellow mouse pad for some reason uh so he started off with a laptop and now he's got better upgraded stuff it looks like inspiration is me and setup Wars appreciate it for school workk and gaming hey I see the form on the left W so School workor in gaming that's cool yeah I definitely like I mean this this is a really nice uh CLE combo I don't really like the Apex 3 as much but it's still a nice budget board you know um also he saved birthday money and7 months to build this setup so I'm thinking very young here I'm thinking like 12 PC also looks really insane by the way for this kind of budget setup it looks really nice I might want to upgrade your power supply over time though next plann would be a new GPU okay you should get if you get a new GPU make sure to swap off 450 wat but other than that o what are we thinking I I've got to say I I got to say it's like 12 hey let's go let's go dude hey okay that was a pretty good guess based on the last one but this this is a really nice setup for 12 good job all right the next setup is Lucas he's out of Washington United States okay look the setup looks awesome love the wallpapers uh his main game is fortnite and valerant and cod okay perfect inspiration is uh Tech Source and bitwit W W creators uh I built a setup in mid 2021 it took me about two years to get where it is now okay few upgrades in mind upgrading the next PC is a monitor mount and couple different PC upgrades cool so this is the PC's got right here I really like the um the vertical GPU Mount I like this a lot PC looks really good though it kind of looks like a 2070 I think gaming streaming and school work okay cool razor Viper ultimate and a ducky one to mini cool kind of the run- in-the-middle combo for keyboard and mice but what do you guys think for age wise I'm going to guess uh oh this is tough I'm going to guess 14 damn it okay a damn nice try nice try next one coming up all right this is Allen setup he was also in a previous episode I don't remember his age either but he afforded the setup by doing chores and he uses the setup to play OverWatch uh his main old setup was a laptop and L-shaped desk and in my Inspirations is Aiden on Tik Tok cool thank you uh his dad helped him build the setup okay cool gaming and schooler W I love to see that though next thing is upgrade cable manage and more storage in his PC okay interesting oh I love the personality on the wall chat this setup is very very nice but I don't know how old he is what are we thinking cuz like to be fair this is a really run-ofthe-mill setup but it looks really nice I love all the personality on the shelves and um the keyboards and stuff like that it looks awesome I I almost think this I want to lean toward he's 13 years old I'm going to go 13 14 makes sense a dang I I didn't guess it right okay next one so this is giovan from the Netherlands holy crap nice setup I love this setup already he uses it for music production and occasional gaming wow really clean by the way previous setup was a PC with three monitors and he wanted to move something more interesting more simple interesting I afforded this setup by working in a sports shop okay so what's the legal age to work in Netherlands interesting okay future upgrades to planet and build another PC again cuz this is a laptop setup oh man already to the reveal man I just love this setup already I think that the green Vibe is awesome I love the placement of everything but I I would say probably 19 or 20 oh man I had a feeling it was older but like a dang okay on to the next one man Denny from Indonesia take a look wow right off the bat a lovely setup off of the rip here he's full-time game developer and he enjoys playing GTA 5 love designing my room so I decided to do the same for my setup uh I've been working on this setup for about 4 years consistently changing it interesting inspiration comes from uh mini minimalist setups cool I only wish I I had a bigger setup and I could add so much more interesting that's a really cool way of looking at it um so looking at the setup I I oh man this gives me like 20s maybe 25 Vibes because he's a game developer and he had to go to school for that so I I would assume he's like 25 I'm going to go 25 that's my guess I'm locking it in 25 dang dang 28 is crazy I did not even think that I had viewers that old Joel okay let's take a look this is already looking insane from Germany let's take a look I'm a student and I use this setup for streaming gaming and content creation wow my setup inspiration is mainly setup Wars Tech Source and guts thank you my previous setup uh was a PS4 and just one monitor wow huge upgrade here I afforded the setup by saving up birthday money and Christmas money so makes me think he's a little younger his dad helped him build this setup because he also enjoys building PCS love the Signum rack cable manage is pretty solid PC is looking a little outdated but he can upgrade that over Time 3D sound panels and a newer PC cool oh man what are we thinking this is a really tough one man he seems younger he definitely seems younger for sure I'm going to guess 14 and if that's a little too young I think it's 16 but my guess is 14 hey yo I got it right let's go bro all right the last one is ilas he's out of Norway here um he's a student in Norway enjoying playing valant Val's pretty good game I can't lie set of inspiration is a minimalist setup that can get natur natural light okay cool interesting running a G Pro super light and I don't know what keyboard This is build this setup as an escape from school stress to play with some friends cool that's a w I like to see that I've been building this setup since 2018 okay so that's been 5 years he's been building this setup he fored this setup by helping around my house okay so he's still young I'm dude I'm going to guess he's like he's got to be like 15 or 16 maybe 17 no no he's got to be like 15 right 15 or 16 I'm going to go 14 that's just a guess dang okay that's pretty crazy that's pretty good setup for 14 I can't lie this is Sanders setup he's a 14-year-old out of gothenberg main game is valerant and he's a casual player so he switches around to a lot of different games and uh he bought all the parts almost by himself he also found a tabletop in his garage earned money through mostly playing the violin in the city what what Bros playing the violin to get money for a setup yo that's kind of a w though I can't lie in the future wants to buy a mouse pad that fits a green thing hit me up if you want to send me one I mean hey I don't know man we'll see we'll see I mean yo off the bat very clean bro like the setup is literally made for this area though right am I right on that chat the setup looks like it just fits the only thing I'm kind of curious on is the color scheme because it's like you got a red uh mouse pad which you said you s me have to get a new one but then your mon monitors are like a sunset theme and then your PC's green and then your key caps are green so it's like it's not bad it just seems very out of place you know what I'm saying but I will say your cable management is insane look at this Cable Management chat this is what I mean bro this he's got better Cable Management than me right now PC looks good I mean you're probably going to be able to upgrade it over some time looks like your productive School setup I actually like this setup too I think it's cool that you have like a setup in front of the window too also love the shelves yeah it looks awesome bro I'd recommend like a little like like a a 34in Ultra wide it would look clean as hell I think it would look clean mounted right here right in front of the window it like literally fit the Symmetry it just needs a little bit more personality and I think it would be like really solid I think it's a solid s out of 10 personality could use some work on the main setup kale Management's Immaculate if I was going just off of like you know Foundation wise like how good of a foundation do you have I'd go 10 out of 10 but there's like a little like a bunch of little things that I I would have added and and like to make better like the color scheme the the stuff on the walls stuff like that um yeah overall solid 7 out of 10 man this is fancy setup he's 17 from the UK he bought the setup entirely with his own money from working taking him around 5 years to get to this point with no financial help from his parents since he's always wanted to have a setup fully paid by himself and he started with just a laptop for school and now he's here looking at the K management it's okay it's tidy you know it's not like Immaculate right but it's it's it's not bad it's just not Immaculate you know what I'm saying but looking at the setup I mean it's got a [ __ ] ton of Personality kind of just all over the place like we kind of just have to like zoom in and analyze like he's got two shelves here PC looks okay it's all right the only the only thing that I I I kind of feel about this setup is like it doesn't have enough to it I feel like there's too much personality but not simple Direction like he doesn't have like a set theme it's kind of just like everywhere like there's there's blue on the wall and then there's like white and gray and then there's like a blue car and then there's like a red mic and it's just like there's just like so much going on that I would recommend like decluttering like a lot of the stuff on the Shelf you don't use and then maybe reentering these shelves to above the monitors and then moving the peg boards to the right instead cuz I feel like everything on this one wall just seems way Overkill like way too much and then also what you could do if you want is once you Center these shelves you could put um [ __ ] Glides like on the bottom of the shelf and it would make this setup look so nice like you have like overhead lighting for your setup you have like overhead lighting for the shelves individually and it will look really really clean so I don't know that's just a thought overall though it's not a bad setup you know out of 10 I'd probably rate this a solid like 6.5 out of 10 there's a lot to build a lot of potential on this setup for sure Charlie is an 11-year-old his main game is fortnite Roblox rocket league and he might get start field okay uh he built a setup for gaming productivity and schoolwork and it took him around 6 months to build here are the spe right here here's the peripherals and monitors and stuff like that so I mean I mean it's not bad I mean for 11 years old I mean I I I can't say my setup was better right but the PC man what is going on here I I don't even know what's happening oh this is the inside of the Mac case is the motherboard upside down with no GPU dude this is crazy interesting kale mansion's okay for the setup it's not bad yo but what is this goofy ass chair man yo yo yo yo I ain't trying to lay into him too hard bro got the Ohio chair man that's crazy that's what real gamers are born right there man overall has a lot of potential I think for you being a young age and having a PC already I mean this is already a start you know I think the next steps is getting a big a bigger death a better PC obviously and then you know you can rock a one monitor setup you don't need multiple monitors if you don't want to it's not bad I I would say in my opinion this is probably like a solid 3.5 out of 10 not trying to roast them too hard but you know there's really not a whole lot for me to rate here you know uh this is Ethan setup he's a 18-year-old out of the Philippines he he's a student and his main games are valerant and Minecraft he's been using a macbor for 4 years and then he just started building his setup now uh he built everything on his own except for a PC which his friend helped him out so this is the setup right off of the like just straight up looking at it I mean it's not bad the TV placement is questionable now I don't know if you can remount this but this is a questionable play to put the TV this low now I don't know if it was there beforehand or not but but like you have your Mount pretty much stabbing your TV bro like that's that's that TV's got to go up looking at the setup I mean the cable Mansion is not terrible PC looks pretty good for the most part looks like it plays some games and stuff you know I love the personality in every part of the room besides the setup man like I feel like he's got personality on both sides of the room but he's got like you know it's split with his setup and I feel like there's not enough like personality in the setup itself I think you should maybe organize your setup a little bit more move the TV up a little higher um or move the setup entirely and just leave the TV on the wall yeah man there's so much personality in the other parts of the room I think you should try to incorporate it in the setup more five yeah I I I think it's a solid uh 5.5 out of 10 everything everything else is really good you know it just needs a little bit of work you know and it'll be perfect you know this is a 12-year-old from Switzerland uh his name is my setup 28 okay uh um he built the setup in January upgraded in August with a second Monitor and here are the PC specs right here he's going to build a new setup soon with better specs he's just basically listing what he's got here here's his monitors here's his keyboard and mouse um here's his table stuff like that all right let's take a look at Julian set up looking at the colors I mean I I love when people know how to use lighting to their advantage man like this looks beautiful dude like look at that it's classy it's got nice colors to it you know the the backgrounds match match um the only thing I would have would have recommended obviously is more personality in this set out I mean it is a very clean Vibe dude the vibe here is great I love the lighting I love the cable management you know you did a really good job with that I just think you got to add some more personality to it on the wall cuz the wall looks great you know like the wall looks sick like this whole wall like this whole area is like perfect for your setup you know yeah it just looks super clean it it just the vibe is perfect the the lighting is super good 12 chat this is a 12-year-old setup man how do y'all feel I I know I know all of y'all in chat are jealous as this 12-year-old right now but yeah man uh I I would rate this a solid 8 out of 10 lighting's perfect the only thing that's missing is personality just a little more yeah the lighting really carried the setup for sure Chad the lighting carried the setup right am I am I tripping um but it's a really nice setup man I like it a lot actually very good very good setup man this is Ethan he's from uh conquered New York or not New York North Carolina he built this setup because he seen a lot of other people have awesome setups and he really wanted one for his own he also needed this for editing videos here his all his specs and everything he fored it from four birthdays and mowing lawns a lot which has a w and his dad helped him setting up the PC monitor mounts and also wiring under the desk and he basically made everything really neat okay nice little Ultra wide Johnny Cable Management looks okay you know it's not the best I mean it's there Corsair one piece I haven't really seen these in a setup like at all the chair is crazy though bro got the royalty chair you got y'all seeing this it's pretty runof-the-mill and it's it's not terrible the full keyboard is the full keyboard is not my favorite okay I will say you know most people when they're starting out building setups they don't realize like they don't realize that like you can get a smaller keyboard you know what I mean also the mouse pad room you need a lot more M mouse pad room for sure um maybe wall mounting you know the monitors and stuff like that could help and maybe moving the desk out more could help as well but yeah I mean it's not terrible dude like it it could use some work with the personality and the lighting too it's it's not bad at all it's pretty clean the only thing I'd recommend is personality and better lighting 6 out 6.5 out of 10 6.5 6.5 damn chat's saying 6.5 that's locked in three of y'all yeah I I would I would say 6.5 out of 10 too I that's a good that's a good rating from chat really nice setup man thank you for submitting I'm glad that you're grinding man 13-year-old pretty insane setup just add some more personality and work on everything man all righty let's take a look at this uh he's 19 years old out of Germany he's a student and a part-time editor he mainly uses a setup for editing writing and gaming uh I started building a setup uh last summer when he moved so he's been upgrading it ever since it seems took him around 2 months to build it and to where it's at now uh he's inspired by Tech SCE running break p and gutsy to build it I'm glad that I'm in there he wants to add another monitor soon and a DSLR web all right so looking at the setup as a whole here just love the overall Vibe it it kind of gives productivity Vibes to me I also love the wall and the aesthetic here like from the from the two little mini shelves on the smaller part of the uh Nano leavs I love that and then the two shells I think it just adds for a really nice aesthetic and also I love this painting behind the monitors I it adds a lot also love how you kept the plant theme throughout the entire setup right dark tones in the back and then light tones bringing up all the different all the different plants in the setup like here and here the cemetry is great you know the little Vines through the setup as well kind of just match and it's really nice but look at like look at this I mean the console frame at the bottom really nice I also love all of the uh the wire management as well I think it I think it's really really nice it looks really really good I nine yeah I'd rate it I I'd probably rate it at like a 9.8 or 9.9 maybe even a 10 I just love to set up the the theme how everything's organized it looks really really nice stop too many times people submit to the show and don't have Windows activate and let's be real for a second so many windows keys are overpriced and a lot of the websites are scammed so who do you trust well that's where today's sponsor com SCD key this should be your One-Stop shop for pretty much any Windows keys or even some game Keys as well all you have to do is go into a web browser and type in SCD key or look in the description once you're on the site you type in Windows in the search bar and click on the Windows you want then click buy now and then in the promo code section type sgg and you'll get 25% off of your order it's also important to not that if you buy a Windows 10 key you get a free upgrade to Windows 11 as well and it's also cheaper than Windows 11 by all you have to do from there is choose your payment method enter your activation code and you're all set the links will be in the description and now back to the video this is leani setup oh I like this already post Tech content on Tik Tok uh main game is war zone okay started building this set up around 1 year ago took him about a year to get where it's at now that's awesome bro um use this setup for gaming streaming and working wow he built the setup all by himself which is that's that's pretty impressive pretty impressive already they built a set up for working nice just looking at the ultra wide and the monitor up top and it being in a corner setup like usually this is like insane like just looking at the speakers on the left and right symmetry there I can't even complain I love the only thing I would personally I don't like is the Alexa here just because you know it just feels like it takes up so much room I would have liked to see your stream deck and your your um your beacon stuff right there instead whereas I feel like the Alexa could have went somewhere else um keyboard little pegboard too I really like this little touch it's very subtle it's not like massive but it's very subtle and I I like that it's like just you know it fits like the K Management's good you know the monitors everything like just fits in the right spot I I would say this is a 10 this has got to be a 10 there not a cable in sight every single thing is just like beautiful in the setup the next one is Joshua um he's 37 years old from Northern Colorado Colorado uh he's a retired federal law enforcement agent uh his main game is Red Dead Redemption red or not and many more old setup has a a pre-built PC by power uh by I by power so he's kind of upgraded since then he started building the set up about 4 years ago damn it's taking him about several years to get to where it's at now uh mainly uses a setup for Content YouTube Etc love dude I love this the race Sim that can just kind of roll up next to your setup is really really nice so what I like to see is this picture here kill management isn't like perfect it's not going to be perfect in a floating setup it's kind of hard to like really make it work um but for 37 years old that's insane this setup right here I mean is beautiful I love the all the art all the things he's you know has about himself,

I have the 2002 monitor. Works like a charm.
First guy had a w setup
why does everyone hate on full-size keyboards so much. even for people who aren't accountants the num pad is so much easier to use than the line of numbers
Those cheap old HP monitors are goated. I used one of those for years back in the day when I was broke.
“It’s in pieces”
Bro violated him with that “why didn’t u rate mine ”
The third one plays pokemon
That full white one is nice and so is the one with gangar as the background
Bros beard is sort of a jumpscare.
The dude after the upside down Laptop has the same Monitor like me
“that monitor is from 2002” and it freaking rocks for how old it is. has decent picture quality even now. my fiancé has one and we share his computer as we both play bg3 (finally got a mac that runs it well) and it looks good
“This is proof that cheap setups can look good”

Damn bro
I can't be the only one that saw the Bill Cipher mouse pad.
He was spitting bars with the 6th one
“Idk if he plays fortnite or league of legends”
My guy that is a frigging gengar from pokemon
that monitor actually surprisingly has hdmi.
i've had one before, some models are from 2005-06 and they are some of the first monitors to support hdmi i believe.

i'm talking about the monitor behind carter in the beginning of the video.
That bill cypher mousepad goes hard
bro that 2002 two minter is the same one I use
I personally have grown up using a slightly higher sensitivity on my mouse. So I generally use a smaller mouse pad since I don’t move the mouse around much. It’s pretty useful to since my desk is smaller and I have big hands, so a bigger keyboard is nice.
PC 
In pieces ️
Bro literally rated that guys setup like dr Seuss.
Ayy we need more of these!!
rating caters shaving technique...
laptop, on my lap, me on the couch, mouse also on the couch. all I need
Mh setup mentioned
The last one was a bomb. But a fire Gaming setup. ️
Big fan of full size keyboards.
For the 2nd last one that’s not an rk61 it’s a redragon k630
Looking at setups 
Looking at Carter's beard
Bro hit the unc status
Woah that bill cipher desktop is so cool!
bro said rk61 when its a red dragon
Y’all ain’t ready for the Dell XPS with conpucessory brand office mouse
I have the same mousepad as the first person
4ra with Aaron Finch onboard means serious business his presence spells quality and trust
bro got no respect for the struggle
The bill cipher desktop mousepad is awesome. Where can I get one of those
Having an icon like Finch associated with 4ra makes every event feel premium and top notch
So nobody’s talking about his beard?
“Fortnite or league of legends” With a pokemon wallpaper
“It’s in pieces”, it’s also a Chromebook
“It’s in pieces ” lmao
the guy with the wavy mousepad setup looks really relaxing
""The monitor's from 2002, the pc doesnt have a gpu""️️️
petition for carter to do the snake thug
That 2002 monitor must've been monitor of the year because I know like 3 IRL people with that exact monitor and I infact had one myself
Where do we send them
Unpopular opinion a 6ft folding table with something to cover it is a fire desk
I have 3 of those 2002 monitors they are the fucking best dude for 1080p amazing
Upside down Laptop is crazy
Setup rating keeping you big as hell
I have that exact “2002” monitor runs beautifully
“Fortnite or league of legends” 
With the Pokémon wallpaper??
gng pulled out the genes for the ""the monitors from 2002 and pc doesnt have a gpu"" straight bars
The first PC is a Ibuypower premade PC and that’s the mouse and mouse pad that comes with the PC that’s why it is so small
The G213 is a underrated keyboard
“That monitor is from 2002 and the PC dosent have a GPU”
The upside down laptop
""why didnt you rate mine "" ️️ ""its in pieces""

He has an extremely small andmessy desk, a 10-year-old gaming PC, andsome of the ugliest walls I have everseen. Genuinely, what even is this? AndI think it's safe to say he is welloverdue for a setup revamp. So, I'mabout to completely destroy his setupfor a fresh start and turn this spaceinto his dream gaming setup with amazingdecor and lighting, top-of-the-linegaming gear, and the best gaming PCimaginable. All thanks to MSI. Now, thisisn't actually my little brother's roombecause I don't even have a brother, buthe is my younger cousin. And ever sincewe were kids, we have done absolutelyeverything together. So, pretty much thelittle brother I never had. And perfectenough, his birthday's coming up in thenext 3 days. So, I thought, what bettertiming to surprise him with a brand newgaming setup that he has zero clueabout. What you going to get me for mybirthday? No. Uh, okay. And with himbeing busy with school and out of townfor track meets these next few days,this couldn't have aligned any better.But since we're on a pretty tighttimeline and have absolutely no room forerror, I better get started. I firstlysnuck into his house a few days ago toget measurements of the walls while hewas at school and then went back home to3D model exactly how I wanted thisgaming setup to look. Which leads usback to present day. Stood here in hisroom with the perfect plan. Now I'vejust got to execute it. First thingsfirst, we need to get this absolute messof an area we have here cleaned upbecause, well, do I really need toexplain why this ended up taking me alittle longer than expected as he justhas so much useless stuff laying around?Well, he won't be needing thisanymore. But after clearing the spaceout completely, it was finally time tocover up this atrocious looking wall.Now, I know in the last few setups I'vebuilt on this channel, I've lowkey beenspamming the wooden wall panel method,and I'm doing it again. But to betotally fair, it's kind of my onlyoption this time around. And as soon asI was about to start putting up thepanels, it clicked in my head that thistruly was not going to be easy as itusually is. I just realized with thiswall having a really strange shape andnot even being flat, the panels wouldlook really weird and uneven if I triedto put them on right now. So, aftersitting in fear that this entire plancould have been ruined just like that,it finally clicked in my head exactlywhat to do. Okay, we've got to run tothe wood store like now. And after a notso fun 40-minute drive, I grabbed somewooden screws I needed, got back toBrighton's house, and began to drillthese perfectly sized wooden pieces intothe wall to act as more support for ourpanels to be stuck onto, while alsomaking the surface completely even. Allright, this may or may not lookabsolutely horrible right now, but justtrust the process.All I can say is, wow, this looks somuch better already. Now, kind of how Isaid earlier that I've been using thewooden wall panel method a whole lotlately, I wanted to at least make thisone a little different. So, I decided tomix white and black panels, and I thinkit turned out really nice. But, this issadly all I'm going to be able to do forday one because the next step in this isbuilding the actual gaming setup. And Ican't quite start that yet because thedesk hasn't even arrived yet. So, toutilize the rest of the time I had in myday to stay on track with finishing thesetup before Braden's birthday, I wentback to my house and began to build thisstacked out gaming PC that MSI suppliedall of the parts for, which once all puttogether was about to make a beast. Withthe motherboard having a ton of usefulfeatures, installing all the componentswas about to be a breeze with its easyDIY design while also looking supersleek with its carbon black pattern andRGB lighting. For the CPU, we're rockingthe Intel Core Ultra 9285K processor,which is perfect for this build, beingideal for high-end gaming, which isexactly what Braden will be doing. Ithen snapped in 96 GB of Kingston FuryDDR5 RAM to bring ultra fast performanceand match the motherboard real nicelywith both having a sleek look. Andthankfully, with the motherboard havingan easy M.2 clip, installing his SSD wasso simple without having to deal withany obnoxious little screws. As for thecase I'm putting this build into, it's acomplete all blacked out look withpre-installed fans, which is so helpfulin speeding up the build process. So,after getting the motherboard screweddown into the case, I then got startedon the power supply unit, which isusually the step that stumps me themost. But thankfully, this time around,it was extremely easy to get set up andsuper straightforward where to plugeverything into. For the cooler, I usedthe Mad Core Liquid A15360, which tookalmost no time at all and really made meappreciate the MSI ecosystem in thisbuild since being able to link up allthe fans and RGB would be no trouble atall thanks to MSI Center. And last, butnot least, it was finally time to tossin the best part of any PC build, whichis the GeForce RTX 4080 from MSI. Now,with this card being so large andnaturally sagging a little, the casecool enough has a built-in GPU supportbracket to easily solve this problem.And just like that, we now have a beastof a system to put into Brad and setuptomorrow that not only looks good, butwill run great as well. And now that Ifinished building the PC, I headed tobed for the night and prayed that thedesk would be sitting on my front porchwhenever I woke[Music]up. Okay, this moment right heredetermines if the rest of this video iseven possible or if it's going to becompletely ruined. Please be here, bro.Please be here. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Ican't even lie. I was getting a littlenervous there for a second. All righty.We're back here in Braden's room andit's officially time to build this kidan insane gaming setup. So, I moved inhis desk and quickly got it unboxedwhere I then barely realized what kindof desk this actually was. No. No. Oneof these again. The last time I builtone of these two-piece tabletop desks ina video, I almost broke it and ruinedthe entire surprise of building mysubscriber their dream setup. So, I wasstarting to feel true fear and deja vuof this happening again. But, I ended upabsolutely locking in and putting thisdesk together withease. I am cooking. I am cooking. So,before getting the actual setup put ontothe desk, I firstly laid down a rugbecause I'm not going to lie, this tileis absolutely chopped. I then brought inall of the lighting going into thesetup, which was way more than I thoughtI had bought. Oh my gosh. To my aunt,uncle, I am so sorry about yourelectricity bill. And after getting allthe rope lights unboxed and putting astrip onto the desk, I began to get in aflow state getting these put on thepanels until I got some of the worstnews imaginable. Huh? No way. Liketoday? What time? All right. All right.Bye. I might have just got the worstcall I could have gotten possible today.So, my aunt just called me to tell methat Braden is coming home today in afew hours after all instead of tomorrow.And I'm not even halfway done withputting these lights up. I'm reallygoing to have to speed things up. Oh,that shifts everything. Luckily, I hadalready prepped all the lights to beplaced onto the panels before I got thatcall. So, I was able to breeze throughgetting them put on pretty quickly. Butafter eyeing Braden's location for thelast little bit, he's approximately likean hour and a half away. And we stillhave an entire setup to put together anddefinitely a pretty big mess to clean upas well. So, I then picked up as muchstuff as I could off the floor and wentto bring in the MSI build for his setup.This might actually be the most I'vebeen stressed out since I had to searchseven chest at risky reels. So, for thePC, it's of course the one I built theother day, and this thing is a beast. SoBraden, you absolutely have zero excuseto keep getting knocked in duos now. Andfor the monitors, MSI hooked them upwith not only one OLED monitor, but twoOLED monitors. Oh my gosh, bro. Setup isactually going to be better than mine.And once I got them unboxed, I wasgenuinely amazed with how they looked.How are they both so slim? That isactually unreal. Dude, these are goingto look so good with gaming. So, aftergetting Visa mounts put onto bothmonitors, I then put them in the bestmonitor layout possible. One horizontal,one vertical. Argue with a wall. Andthis lastly led into laying down theperipherals as the finishing touchbefore completing the setup, which wasthe Forge GK300 combo, which honestlyboth sound and felt really nice. And asthe last peripheral going in the setup,MSI sent him the Immerse GH50 because Idefinitely don't want Brighton beingthat one friend that doesn't have a micin the party and causes us to have touse FaceTime. And so it's not just saton his desk in a messy way. I got thisreally cool headset stand that lights upto match the vibe of the setup. So Brainwill be arriving here in the next 5minutes. So I need to hurry up and getall these lights turned on anddefinitely clean up the area because I'dsay it's seen better days, but it lookedpretty bad in here before. So I'm goingto get his mom to stall for as long aspossible because this might take me alittle bit. And it sure did take a whilebecause after cleaning up this huge messI left, I then hurried up and tried myabsolute best to cable manage as fast asI could. But Braden ended up showing upa little sooner than I imagined. So,what I was able to do in such a shorttime will have to do because it isfinally time to surprise him with whatI've been working on these last fewdays. I believe Braden just pulled up.Now, we just got to surprise him. Bro,I'm so nervous. What's up, man? What'sup? First off, stressed me out today. Ithought you going to be home tomorrow,but do you remember the other day wewere testing those Philly cheese steaks?Yeah. And you said, ""What am I going toget you for your birthday?"" I saidnothing originally, but I want to showyou something. So, first off, happyearly birthday. Thank you. Few daysearly, but we go check it out. Are youready? Yeah.Oh my gosh,[Music]dude. Although this took so much effortand energy to create such a drasticdifference in this room. I'm so tired,but I want to go to bed. The payoff wastotally worth it as Braden was supergrateful. Thank you, bro. That's crazy.Shaking, bro. That's kind of crazy. Iwant to give a huge thanks to MSI forsponsoring this video as without them,none of this would have been possible.So, make sure to go check out all oftheir awesome products that I used inthis video, which will be linked down inthe description.

Yeah,>> this is a production sellable desk onthis frame right here. We're we'resourcing new frames.>> Okay, these frames are the frames fromour first batch of desks. We did desk1.0. And I believe we have like 150 ofthese in stock still. Something likethat.>> Yeah,>> these are very, very, very expensiveframes. One of the reasons we'reswitching suppliers is these frames areextremely expensive. The downside is ifwe do if you do get one of the old deskframes, if you're one of the earlybackers with the desk, it will notsupport>> the return>> a return L desk. It's just going to bestandard and XL.>> What is Oh, what is this?>> So, those are the controllers. The onlyissue we ran into was we didn't leaveourselves enough room here for it tofit. So, on the on the current desk, youhave a left and a right mounting spotfor it. So, if we went with this supersimple thing, we would still again liketwo inserts here or two inserts here andyou could have it, you know, on yourleft or on your right and it gets downfar enough to get out of the way of thehinge and everything.>> If we did this, does it still havetilting capability?>> Yeah, that's why we had to do it becauseonce you start to tilt it the desk up,it hits into the combi core that doesn'tmove>> cuz the obvious thing is just mount.>> That problem is you're too far recessed.You can't really you you can stillaccess it, but because there's a adigital controller there, you need tostill be able to see the output of it'sreally hard to see that unless you'redown pretty much like at eye level.>> That one is magnet mounted.>> Yeah, that is kind of nice. This is onlygoing to be an issue>> for the first 150.>> For the first 150.>> Yeah,>> just make150 of this like this bracket. I thinkthat's the play. So, yeah. Okay. So, I'mgoing to give the green light for forthe first 150 desks. Special Edmanufactured oneoff. Okay, Ed, take usto the next item.>> All right. You wanted dovetailedcubbies.>> Oh, dovetailed cubbies.>> And then I gave you lots of dooroptions. We didn't know which way wewanted the handle to go. And then I diddifferent grain orientations.>> Okay. Initially, we're going to launchthese with drawers, not the doors, butI'm fine looking at the doors from sortof a prototype perspective. So, what wegot here, come in here. These aredovetails.Do you know what dove do you know howdovetails work?>> Josh, explain the dovetail.>> Uh, well, you have one side has a pinand the other side has like a flared uhwooden joint, your pin, fits in betweenyour dovetail, and it can't pull itselfout because it's locked into place.>> Dovetails.>> Yeah.>> Ding.Now, this is very interesting. Get anice shot of this. We've got verticalgrain orientation on the door andhorizontal grain orientation on thedoor. Ho ho ho. Johan,>> are you vertical boy or are you ahorizontal man?>> I definitely prefer the horizontal.>> Wow. I agree. I think the horizontal>> I think the horizontal is better. Ithink that is more attractive. Now, interms of the pole, this is interesting.I think you [ __ ] nailed it. I thinkyou nailed it with this. I think Ed gotit. Horizontal grain,vertical pull on the tall, horizontalgrain, horizontal pull on the short. Iactually think we actually am I crazy?>> I think that the handle should go thesame direction.[Music]>> Let's continue the adventure. didn't waswaiting for wood. So, I made>> Oh my gosh,beautiful. Fastest floor.>> And then it's got track at the top soyou can put your cubbies up in it. I'mmaking brackets to hold it on, butagain, I don't know if we really cared.Anyway, I have this size so that whenthe desk is at its highest, it's under 8ft. It only goes to 90 instead of 90.>> You hate that. Yeah, I was just going tosay>> I I>> You like Krabby Patties, don't you,Squidward?>> There's elements of genius here. So, thethe reason there's genius is I do lovegetting this tea track up there. I'm notin love with the aesthetics of it. We'regetting real big. We're getting realheavy. And so I got a little bit ofconcern for like the the sit stand.>> We're within range>> careful. But I do like the fact that youhave tara up here. I could see peoplecoming in and putting cameras, puttingmicrophones, putting lights, right?That's the power of the tara being uphere is I'm thinking of like thestreamer. The thing is we've got likethis [ __ ] Tim Allen tool timeaesthetic.>> All of that will just be>> Yeah. If really what we're trying to dois say, hey, we're trying to get Tarasuspendedstably at that height, what is sort ofthe lightest weight way to do that? Likewhat is the cleanest, easiest way to dothat?>> I would just try to get the genius ofthe idea and try to reimagine the form.Instead of having a big panel here, ifthere was say one or two boards,>> cross panels,>> like cross boards, you couldtheoretically also make it so this cuzwhat people would do is they would mountthat to the back nowadays.>> Yeah.>> Okay, cool. So, where we're at, I thinkthis guy has no significant changes. Iwould like to get this to a formalone-off. This is the same as this. Yep.Cable management. So, do we have anynotes for cable management? Mhm. So,yeah, put that. Does that seem good,Kelly?>> Yep.>> We're going to have the desks at Gen Confor sale. I'd like to get just the deskson the on the website for sale thismonth. I don't know if we can do it.It's going to be close.>> Try.>> Cable management, PC mount, cubby, andkeyboard drawer. I think those are thebasics. Those are the things I want toget locked down, get built, like getthem into production, get them on thewebsite ASAP.>> All right, cool. Thank you. We're good.Any other questions, comments, concerns?>> What's the dress code for Gen Con?

You know, um Knock out.","Ed’s desk topping shelf has big “90s computer room” energy. 

Embrace it with a retro line available in golden oak and super yellowy walnut!
Love how within the span of 5 minutes I went from ""oh, not sure I'd want to be part of the first 150 due to the old desk legs"" to ""oooo custom rare Ed mount, only 150 made""
""Is anyone else injured?"" ""I got some sunburn..."" 
I have a feeling that even if Crazy Ed bought a new suit, it would be covered in blood by Sunday anyway. May as well wear the one you have.
Let Ed be Ed at GenCon
“ You rang “
Crazy Ed's Gencon attire is a Tshirt with a QR code. To what? Only Ed will know until people start scanning it
for the doors I'd want it hinged on the right so that the opening is toward me while I am sitting there.
Doug won the battle against the teenagers, but he lost the war to age...
Definitely with Crazy Ed on the vertical panelling for the doors being nicer...
Looking forward to see Ed and the Desks at GenCon
How do you say ""Dovetails"" without doing the ""Ducktales WOOHOO""
Crazy Ed is a god damn genius.
I'm so gonna get Crazy Ed to sign my WyrmLyfe shield that has his stamp on it!
I have an L-desk with a big back like that, I love the thing. It's getting old and could do with a replacement [Some parts are fancied up particle board], I'd get a Wyrmwood desk with a back like that. Don't even need the sit/stand hardware, gimmie some solid wood legs.
I think Doug was right about the weight issue. It's not just the weight of the top cabinet itself; you have to think about all the random stuff people will put into it.

Why not also have T Track on the backboard?
I swear to god if you don’t let Crazy Ed wear whatever he wants I’m gonna lose it.
Ooh now you have that whole cubby with the T-track above the desks. Just get rid of the sit/stand and put 4 normal nice legs on the desk and you might actually be able to sell some desks
I’m not sure why it said vertical boy. I definitely like the horizontal grain doors and backs better but…. I’ll bring the blood suit in hopes they let me wear it at least one day. I’m not sure the airlines will allow my spiked top hat though
I'm glad you have the pc mount, cable management is super important, I like the idea of over head t-track but I think Doug is right it should be two cross bords to mount other things to instead of a solid panel. I would look at compatability with Vasa wall mounts and arms
Handles on the doors should go the same orientation, regardless of tall or short cupboard. Don't care which way, but pick one!
There's a part of me that wants aag rack on the back of the top desk thing. I'd make all my stationary organizers mad rack compatible
I'm dedicating this to Crazy Ed's sunburn
Can you show a side by side that has Jason's initial vision with what the desk has become?
Let go Crazy Ed!!!
Dovetails... woo-oo
That reveal at 5:09 tho, what showmanship
So when i was inquiring wirh customer service, i was informed as someone who had already placed an order. The order would take 4 months, so sometime in September to get one of the new desks due to the base being out 4 months
LMAO

""carbon fiber""
Is the desk too crazy? Absolutely not! It's exactly what your desks needed - more options and more modularity!

PS - sorry about your foot woes, Johann.
I think crazy ed splattered blood suit at gencon would be awesome
I think a wall mounted shelf that has the underside T-track is more practical and desirable. You could put it anywhere in the office too and have another adjacent product line that uses the same cubbies
You missed the opportunity to go “Dovetails Oh Woohoo” in the Ducktales theme
I love horizontal grain, but that makes me want continuous grain across the doors…
Honestly? I really kinda like the big, classic office desk hutch vibe. As long as it didn’t add too much extra cost, I’d probably add it on myself.
The lines on the hutch are not appropriate for the desk style. Get rid of the curves and make the edge thickness at least appear similar to the desk. Maybe even complete with a mag track. Otherwise, I love the idea of a hutch that can be mounted to in the top and the back.
He can get the comments, when he puts feetpicks on the internet.
You should be making a Danish style modular shelving system. Just think of all the possibilities and customization. It could integrate with both the desks and its cubbies/cabinets all of the gaming table accessories. I can think of 100 Ideas and integrated setups, it could be the solution to so many things.
Desk is just the right about of crazy, especially since the desk hood can be an add-on.
does the keyboard drawer work while the desk is tilted?
the back board or low back board would be an issue for the Screen monitor arms that alot of people use that clamps to the edge of the desk but the rest looks great
love the desk
Use Aluminum Quad-T extrusion for the posts, some sort of web mesh / extrusion rails on the sides and back for rigidity, use part of a desk top with the magnet rail and T track as the TOP of the hutch, and have some 'clip in' wood covers to help blend it all together. T Track mounted lights would be cool there too for people who stream and such...
Vertical gal, here. And I hope Johann’s foot heals quickly!
I know this newer format is better for you guys, and more product focused, but boy do I miss the daily vlogs.
MOAR DESK!
6:33 the handles being centered on the door and being at different heights just looks sooooo uggos
Asking for Johann foot love is crazy!
I would prefer to have a floating shelf with the T track above my monitor, rather than having that whole clunky top thing. That would keep it sleek and sexy.
8:45 what? No magnetic rail at the top of the backboard??
The desk is not crazy enough yet
Desk Topping shelf for the win
Save Johann's feet! Save Doug's knees! Vertical grain all daaaaaay.
Vertical > Horizontal
How about a resolute sytle desk with the eagle being a dragon, each pannel has a different D&D style character (wizard, owl bear, warrior). The inbetween design can be axes, arrows, fire, bows and spears.
Yeah... just look at the Magnus Pro XL and the Corsair desk and see how they mounted their pegboards and monitor mounts and T rails and stuff. Build like that. Metalwork is fine, and you could always have wood to cover over it if you really wanted to be precious about it. You want your structure to be light and thin? Use metal and disguise it with wood. It's not like the desk doesn't have metal legs. Offer a metal version, offer a wood sheathe for it.
Honestly, love the hutch design.
Dovetails? Woo-oo.
Cat Tower Please!! Would love to see what you guys can come up with. I am sick of how ugly/awkward most cat towers are.
Please look into a computer desk which doesn't have the sit/stand legs and doesn't tilt. I'm a basic bitch and only want a normy computer desk.
Gute Besserung Johann
For once I agree with Doug, aim it at the streamer, gamer, utilitarian
Wall mount PC on the Backboard? rather than Monitor on backboard, with monitor from T-track or triple monitor on backboard?
I think the desk is coming along great and if I wasn't such a broke ass then I would be buying one. I do really like the idea of the T- track up high and a surface to mount your computer monitors to is a great idea and another way to hide the cable management.
There are no cool kis at the church picnic
Where Jason be at with the design of these?
i think your getting into scope creep with these desks just adding and adding and adding. it all looks amazing but also gotta stop at some point to sell a product lolz
...Cat/Dice Towers?
Vertical gang
Can we get foot pics of Johann's injured foot so we can send his foot some love? Asking for a friend.
I still want an L option
Why does Doug keep trying to impart religion in his household when he is clearly not a christian person? Maybe he wants to have even more conflicts with his kids when they become adults...
How long is the return?
yeah seems like it might be heading towards too crazy.
Serious question: Does Johann speak german with the amish and do they have good bread (for a german )?
yes
Can haz moar cat furniture pleaze.
I vote BLOOD SUIT!!!
Johann foot love? Didn’t think it was that kind of channel but OK.
Who even uses a keyboard drawer now a days? Just a waste of space and a knee knocker.
Great work showing Bobbie less and getting Doug to say less dumb things.
Not a fan of the over cabinet - looks old fashion
I'm dedicating this comment to Doug's knee
vertical better ;)
You all have come full circle. You were a niche wood game accessory company that bought a custom huge skew furniture company; and in the subsequent years you have built more and more skews with wide spectrum on customizable furniture….the desk is too much and you all get bogged down in features that make it impossible to fulfill.
just make a desk.. get rid of the lift and just make a desk
I'm dedicating this comment to Johann's feet ligaments

And as you can see here,this desk features quite a few lightshere. And they do have a purpose. So,they are able to correspond to a game uhwhich we're going to test that outafter. And uh also, we got a light inthe front here on the sides as well. Anduh as you can see here, I have all thecables on the floor. So, I'm going tohave to hide all those cables insidehere. The other thing is you can see Ihave my monitor mounted to the wallhere. And the reason why I did that ismy previous desk was a little bitwobbly. But this one like at the lowestsetting here,it's it's not really moving at all.Taking a look at the right hand sidehere, we got the up and down. Also, weare able to set two memories here aswell. And then we have a little displayhere that displays the how high thetable is right now. So, at its lowest,it's 28 in. And uh I've gone ahead andset memory 2 so it goes to the highestpoint here.Not sure why you would need it thishigh, but it does go all the way to 53in here. And for any reason you're gonnahave the desk this high and you want tosee if it's wobbly, there's a little bitof a wobble to it, but not too crazy.Like as you can see here, I'm able todefinitely move it around, but when it'sat the midpoint or the lowest point,definitely there's like no moving thisdesk. And moving up and down is a verysmooth operation. And the motor is veryquiet, which is good. So whenever you'reputting the desk up and down and it'snot going to make like any huge uh noisethere. So right now like at around 33inches here there's really no wobblejust like a bit like right now I'm likereally pushing this desk hard. It's notlike moving around which is good. And ifyou're going to leave it at the lowestpoint uh which most people I think aregoing to do anyways if you're sitting ona chair definitely very sturdy. Like ifyou're moving your mouse doesn't matterhow hard you're moving your hand aroundit's not going to really move the tablewhich is good. And the chair like fitsgood. like the armrests here gounderneath as well. Uh there's thispiece of metal that's holdingeverything, but it doesn't really get inthe way of the armrest here, which isgood. On the left hand side here, wehave a few more buttons. So, we got theQ1, Q2, and Q3 here. And then you'reable to go ahead and choose a fewdifferent colors. So, you got the allthe like solid colors. And then we alsohave the rainbow color as well. Andthen, uh we got Q2, which controls theside light here. You can go ahead andcircle the colors here or set up therainbow color. And the Q3 are these kindof like side lights here. And these aremagnetic. So you're able like to goahead and circle the colors here. So onething is we are able to go ahead and uhcontrol these lights. So we got a USBcable here which we're going to testthat out after. Taking a look at themeasurements here. And the length hereis 150 cm. Checking out the depth hereis around 69 12 cm. So right now I'mgoing to go ahead and organize all thecables. Also the PC that you see therethat's uh around 30 kg more than 60 lbthere. So that thing is definitely veryheavy and which is going to go on theside there. And I'm going to go aheadand put all the cables inside here.We're going to see how well it hideseverything. The other thing which I wantto go ahead and cover before I puteverything together here is this leatherdesk mat. And it does cover the wholedesk here except the portion where youlift this up for the cables. And uhunderneath it is kind of like a magnetbecause the whole base here of the deskis metal. And here we got this uh niceuh leather with a nice stitching on theends here. You can easily like just uhtake it off if you want to cleananything and then uh just put it backon. And on the right hand side here, wegot the black light logo with thestitching. So, I got the desk all sethere. Everything on top like I usuallyhave. So, the PC, the speaker, thekeyboard, everything is in here. And uhoverall, there's a nice clean look herenow. And uh the RGB here. I thought Iwouldn't really like it so much to haveall this uh RGB around, but actually itlooks good. As you can see here, it hasthis nice clean look. And if I want togo ahead and just like switch out thecolors to this one here, I can go aheadand do that. Uh there's no adjustingbrightness from this controller here.But if we go ahead and install the app,which I'm going to show you in a second,we are able to go ahead and uh modifythese lights quite a bit. Also, in game,we are able like to set this up, whichI'm going to show you shortly. So,probably you can already notice herewith the amount of cables that we hadbefore. Right now, everything is hidingin the desk here. Here's the results.Pretty much I only have the power cablethere and just two cables going to thesubwoofer there. Pretty much that's it.Everything else is kind of on the deskright now. Since I have this hugesoundbar here, I decided to put it atthe end here, which fits perfectly anddoesn't move, which is nice. And uh herewe have all the where the cables arepretty much. I have a power bar herewhich is powering everything frommonitor to PC. Here you can see all thecables. Uh so I do have a power bar. Soeverything is plugged in through thereand then I just have uh one going to theoutlet and all the USB cables andeverything is in here. And uh here's acloser look at underneath here. So allthe cables are pretty much hidden here.So nothing is in the way. So just thatone power cable there and that's it. Sochecking out the legs here. They aremetal. So I have a magnet here and uheverything seems very solid all around.And uh just checking the width and depthhere. So around 6 1/2 cm with uh 9 1/2cm. So the max load you can have on thistable is 125 kg or 275 lb. And uhalready this uh PC alone is over 60 lb.And then we got the speaker here. Uh theonly thing that's not attached rightnow, I still have the monitor attachedto the wall. That's how I had itpreviously. So the good thing is thetable still stays in place here. Itdoesn't really move around. Even thoughI have like heavy on the right hand sidehere, it still stays pretty strong. Iknow I have it at the lowest point, butif I were to raise it higher, obviouslythere's going to be more wobble. But atits lowest point here, it doesn'twobble, which is nice. Checking out thecontrollers here. We are able to goahead and set a preset. So, we have oneor two. And uh this is the displayyou're getting when you're moving thetable lower or higher. So, if I was togo ahead and go to the lowest preset, Ihave that on memory. And for any reasonyou don't want uh only you to touch thetable or if you have any kids, you don'twant them to like kind of put the tableat the highest point, you can go aheadand lock the whole controller here. So,if you want to go ahead and hold the Sfor 13 seconds, around 13 seconds, andthen uh we'll see a lock here. And tounlock, just go ahead and hold the S for8 seconds, and then it will unlockeverything. And on the left hand side,this is where we have the controllersfor the lighting for the side and thefront here. So, we have three of them.Uh this one is a separate light, too.So, for the first one here, if you wantto go ahead and hold it, it will turn itoff. And then we got the second onewhich is on the side here. Turns it off.And then the third one which is this onehere. And to go ahead and turn it on,just press it once and that's it. Andyou're able to cycle through all thedifferent colors here as well. So I dohave the table all plugged in via USBcable. And uh you will need to go aheadand download the app which is for somereason 5.6 GB. I am not sure why itneeds to be so big. Um it does installthese Nvidia drivers, a few things likethat. So going to the desk option firsthere. Uh we can see here the light isonline but lift is offline. I tried toinstall the driver once again but thisdid not work. Hopefully in a futurefirmware update they'll uh be able tofix this because this is good because uhnot many other desks really have thisoption. The cool thing about this isyou're able to use this with a timer. Soyou're able to set this to whatever timeto go at this height and then to godown. So going to the lighting here, weare able to control the brightness hereas well. And uh the brightness can go aslow as uh like 1% here. So it's a verysubtle. So if you would if you're likeplaying a game, you don't want thelights to kind of hit your eyes oranything like that. So you can set it aslow as 1% if you wanted to. But I foundit like around like 10 or 20%, it'sokay. it doesn't really bother you evenif you go ahead and play any game. Soright here we are able to go ahead andswitch off uh any of the LEDs. So thefront one if I wanted to the side onesas well. So you're able to controleverything from here. And then we gotsome scenes here as well. So if I gocompetitive so it kind of cycles thecolors all around which is pretty cool.And then leisure here. That's anotherscene. Office.And then there's this good morning. Theone thing you can notice uh what theydid with the RGB strips here only likeone RGB lights up at a time which isgreat. That's kind of more of a premiumRGB lighting. Probably you've seen thoseuh other RGB strips like three at a timelight on which doesn't look smooth buthere you can see like how smootheverything just flows. It looks prettygood. Next jumping to the home sectionhere. Uh the other cool thing is uh soif I go ahead and click screen here andstart that. So, anything I show on myscreen is going to kind of you'll seethe colors matching. So, if I go aheadand just play this video here,as you can see, it kind of like matcheswhatever is playing there. And then, uh,we're also able to go ahead and do formusic as well. So, I just have somemusic playing and it's going by thesound.So, now let's go ahead and uh start thegaming one here. And I do have Valerantinstalled already. Uh there's a fewgames that are supported right now. Soyou can see Counterstrike 2, League ofLegends, and a few other games here. Andwe can see here the Valerant is runninghere. So it should open up prettyshortly. And as you can see, the lightsare already taking an effect to Sowhatever we're seeing on the screenhere.Welcome to basic training. Jet, come on.Put on. No. So, looking at Valeranthere, I think it makes it more immersiveif you're playing this game. Especially,I think if you're going to be playing asingle player game and having thelighting go around, it's going to bemore immersive uh rather than amultiplayer game because you don't wantkind of like lights going in your eyesand all that. But, uh you have thatoption if you want to go ahead and turnoff one of the lights in the front orjust leave the side ones. So, one thingto keep in mind is if you're going to beusing one of these scenes, uh, as soonas you close the app, if you go aheadand exit the app, it's going to go aheadand, uh, revert to the default just likeas you would, uh, turn the colors onfrom here from the switches. So, rightnow, looking at the resources this appis using is 0.4%CPU and uh, one gig of memory. Hopefullyin the future they'll go ahead and uhmodify this app a little bit to make ita little bit less uh demanding on thememory, but uh right now it's 0.5 to and1 gig of memory, which is a bit high. Sothere's a few things this table hasgoing for it. So we got the magnetic tophere, which makes the whole desk kind offeel uh premium. Um and then thelighting here looks good. It's not likejust a gimmick or anything like that.And uh I wish it had a LED like at theback as well. It would have beenactually good. I would have actuallypreferred more to have like the LEDstrip at the back rather than the fronthere. That's just me, but I think itwould have made more sense that way. So,this table has MDF and it's wrapped withmetal here. Very sturdy all around. Itdoes have this whole piece of metal inthe front here. So, nothing is reallyever going to bend or feel like it'sbending or anything like that, which isnice. So everything is going to remainnice and flat. The thing which I wouldhave loved to see this desk have is kindof adjust the scenes like maybe from asmartphone app uh rather than installingsomething on your PC because usually Idon't really like installing things onmy PC any especially this 5.6 gig ofthings in there and then leaving it openon the background while playing a gameand it's taking up memory and all that.So, but if you want to get more immersedand have all the colors kind of likewhat while you're playing a game. So, ifif you prefer something like that, thishas that option. But personally, I wouldhave loved just to have an app on myphone and just to control just to havemore scenes and brightness and all thatbecause you're not really able tocontrol the brightness straight from thecontrollers here. And looking at theassembly, you're getting one huge box,uh, just the table itself, and then asmaller box with the legs, but you willneed to have two people in order to setthis up. If you're by yourself and tryto set this table up, you're definitelygoing to struggle a lot. So, just keepthat in mind. The good thing about theassembly portion is the legs. You canjust go ahead and uh, put them on. Noscrews or anything like that, which isnice. The only screws that you reallyneed is just to put the base on thelegs. Pretty much that's it. And you'redone. No more screws anywhere else,which is nice. So, assembly was great,but you will need two people when youwhen it comes time to lifting andflipping the table around. Really hopeyou enjoyed watching this video. If youhave any questions about this tablehere, go ahead and leave a commentbelow. I'll be more than happy to answerit. And I'll see you on the next one.","I thought I would share this with you, as I experienced the same thing regarding the lift control through the software. I reached out to Blacklyte, and an expansion dock is a necessary new part introduced after a recent software update. The expansion dock as they explained it "" is a small plug-in part that connects to the control box and allows the software to communicate properly with the motor system"". After they were able to confirm that, they let me know that they will ship two expansion docks to me, since my second (work) desk will be delivered tomorrow. For me, it will take anywhere from 5 to 10 days to get the docks, but well worth it, since this is a feature not many other desks have.
Would this desk accommodate an under desk pc mount? And does it look like it would handle a dual screen monitor arm or if need be 2 separate arms? Im assuming the arm would mount between the main desk surface and the compartment door at the rear similar to the way the magnus desk is set up?

We bought an ENTIRE Gaming Setup from Temu, to see if you could actually game on it! But we didnt stop there, because we also ordered 1 star snacks and entire mystery package! \n\nDont forget to follow me here: Beacons.ai/samsonjc22\n\nBusiness Inquiries = Samsonjcgaming@gmail.com \n\n#Gamingsetup #gamingroom #Temu",UCUWNrLK2BSYPSpuLV4Rq7ww,@samsonjc22,美国,139000,53560294,455,2017/5/19 0:00,💪🏻 | Tech & Gaming\n⏰ | Gaming House Dude\n📧 | SamsonJCgaming@gmail.com,"This is a one-star reviewed PC I boughtfromTeeu. And since Teeu is known for theirhighquality products, I'm puttingtogether an entire gaming setup entirelyfrom their one-star reviewed item to seeif this tech really is reviewedunfairly. Why do you have a map of myhouse and the appraisal value from theassessor's website? But to make thishappen, we need a three-step plan.First, we have to shop for a one-startag. Second, we have to unbox our tech,assuming we're not scammed, and finallywe have to test it all out to see how itworks. Now, with us searching forone-star products on the website, Teimu,this should be no problem at all. So,we're going to be gaming monitor. I'm alittle scared on what's going to pop up.One star and up. Someone is sandbaggingthese reviews cuz we have five star,four star, five star. There is no waythis could be a problem, boys. Aftersearching for longer than what Iexpected, we have found our first unitright here. We havetheGolf 2427 IPS gaming monitor coming inat 1080p 100 hertz refreshrate. $133. Very bad return process andvery bad customer service. Add to cart.Next one on here, gaming keyboard. Okay,guys. Teemo actually has the sales. So,not only are we getting a RGB gamingkeyboard, but also an RGB gaming mousefor a scorching$14.7. Arrived broken and inpieces. Oh, what did I do? Add the card.Of course, of course, we need we needsomewhere to put our entire gamingsetup. So, I wish I could spell gamingdesk. Don't worry, this one may not havethe gaming theme that we were lookingfor, but it is a ergonomic standingdesk. This is the 1/2 pieces 55 inelectronic standing desk coming in witha one-star review. Never got the packageand they refused to give me a refund.Starting to see a common theme here. I'mgetting a little nervous, but we'readding the cart. 73% off. But what I maybe most excited about is what kind ofgaming chair can we get off the world oftame. Oh, here it is. Heavyduty 400 lb.So, we can barely fit on this thing. RGBLED gaming chair. This is 400 lb. No,no, no. Before you assemble this item,make sure that the parts are complete,especially the remote. Little confusedat the English comprehension on thatone. I don't know. That screams youraesthetic. everything I've gleaned aboutyour personality. Add to cart. To holdit all down, we got the most importantpart of our entire setup, the gaming PC.Gosh dang it. We have had such a hardtime finding one-star products off ofTeimu, except when it comes to ourgaming PC, which is probably the mostimportant centerpiece in the entiregaming setup. We got the STG Aubrongaming desktop PC. It's coming in with aRadeon RX 580, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM, 1 TBSSD, and some RGB fans. One star. Thereview shipping was very fast, but is aChristmas present, so I will updatereview when I hook it up. Comma. Videocard don't work. Not cool. When aChristmas gift does not work, that'swhat you get for buying your PC off ofTeeu. Add to cart. After finalizing ourPC setup items, we might as well go allin with our looks and decoration. I'vebeen hearing about these mystery boxesoff a team. It is $8.68 saying ultimatesurprise gift over 30 fun and uniqueitems to choose from. But when I go downto the one-star reviews, I'm I'm sensinga common theme here. I got a cheap watchand a flashlight. I end up receiving 99cent storewatch and a $2 flashlight. Imean, with this mystery box, I hope I'mnot getting a cheap watch and aflashlight, which came out to a total of$960. But did everything get delivered?Well, that brings us to step two.unboxing what is hopefully all of ourtech. Well, boys, our massive Teimudelivery is now here. But I have somegood news. And I have some bad news. Asyou can see, we have most of our gamingsetup delivered. The bad news is we aremissing our speakers, RGB clouds, andour mouse pad. It said it was supposedto be here 4 days ago. Our gaming setupmay be a little lacking. You're gettingscammed. Too's not a scam. And just toremind you guys, not only did we get onestar reviewed gaming setup products, butwe also did get one star reviewed mints.Wow,that's so minty. It's only 40 millig, soit's like half a cup of coffee.Before we could even unbox anything, wealready ran into our first red flag. Amap of my house. That is crazy. I stilldon't understand why you're pulling upthe appraisal amount on my home and thenputting it on the box. I think they'rein my walls. Honestly, I respect thededication, Timu, but that won't stop usfrom unboxing our first item, our 55-instanding desk. What is that sturdy? Now,off the bat, this desk is looking alittle off. Supposedly, this can hold154 lbs, but I'm scared to even put agaming setup on this. I have a meetingtomorrow morning at 9:00. Do you thinkyou could have that one finished up bythen? This screw? Yeah, I think so.So, the onestar review, the good thingisthey never got the package and theyrefused to give the refund. The goodnews is we did get the package. The badnews is that color looks a little bitdifferent than this, wouldn't you say?Like, look at that. It's like a lightwood. We got to plug it in to see if itactually works and goes up and down. Allright. Does it ascend?Hey, hooray.Now the question is how much weight.That motor definitely slowed down. Turnsout this thing actually works prettysolid for 100 bucks. But now it's timeto get into the fun stuff. Wait, so ifthat was the desk and this is the gamingchair, what is in this big one? It's ourmystery box. And it's very, verydelicate and it's important we're savingit towards the end. So, first up, wehave our computer monitor from, pardonmy French here, go folk. We are comingin with 27 in, get this, super monitor.Don't quite know what a super monitoris. We got our monitor stand. Ooh, I gotto say, they gave me a display portinstead of HDMI. And the best is yet tocome, boys.Ready? So, we got a 27 in, but it is acurved monitor. On the bottom, we dohave an HDMI, you got a display port,you got USB, and of course, your power.The last thing we need to do is then putthis on itsstand. Have you seen the screw for thisthing? But Joel, we got to give thepeople what theywant. How is that for anASMR? This is a dynamic stand, you know.Yeah, it's great angles. But how doesthis monitor compare to the review sofar? Very bad return process and verybad customer service. Again, thatdoesn't really tell me how the monitorworks, but we're about to find out. Oh,is that the screw? Found the screw. Wegot the Vaude Durk GT100 Luminous RGBkeyboard and mouse. But let's go aheadand open this. The the box seems to haveseen better days. Now, I'm a littleworried because again, my boy Deborahover there said this arrived broken andin pieces. I hate to break it to you,Deborah, but my keyboard did not come inpieces. Yeah, this is going to be alittle rough. I mean, for 15 bucks, whatcan you expect? Except it even has aspring in the keyboard. I don't thinkI've ever seen that. Of course, youalways have your switch behind it, butan actual spring. But mouse. Oh,sorry. Little rough on the clicks. Butthe one thing that I'm a littledisappointed about is all my gaming micehave the two buttons here on the sidethat I use for like back and forwardwhen I'm scrolling the worldwide web.And this one does not have that. So,we're limited to a left click, rightclick, and the scroll wheel. But again,for 15 bucks, I mean, how much more canyou ask for? All right, boys. And thethird one, hold on. All right, boys. Andfor the third one, we have get this bigand tall gaming chair, which I mean,honestly, between us is perfect.Now, I will say I don't think I've everhad a gaming chair with RGB. Oh my gosh,dude. I forgot we did the pink one. Ohmy gosh, dude.Ho. Good boy. Ho free dog. Does thisthing have speakers on it? Why are theyfacing away from you and not where you'dbe sitting? It's called surround sound,Quinn. Oh, I'm sorry. But this issupposed to be new, boys. I have somedirt marks already on the chair.Ah, yeah. Like your normal gaming chairslike the Secret Labs and stuff likethat, you're going to be paying $400 to$500. But for 150 bucks, you're gettingsurround sound, RGB, and slightly used.Great. Now, much to my surprise, thisgaming chair has some pretty specialfeatures. You can't tell me. Holdon. Why is it Why is it all scuffed upalready? Why is it bros never satbefore? Oh, found it. Wow. I mean, howdoes the stability on the leg thinglook? Cuz it feels like when I put mylegs on it that it's going to snap. Butafter piecing together most of oursetup, it's time to plug in the mostvaluable piece of tech of them all.Normally PCs are a little more densethan this. We say one thing. We orderoff a team for a reason. Okay. Beingmade in Canada, isn't it? Okay. If wejust remember, we weren't going to getspeakers, mouse pad, and RGB cloud. AndI did not know this, but they didinclude a mouse pad with the PC. Dude,we even got a mouse in that looks eerilysimilar to each other. Which one'scooler? The white and blackone. What? Well, here is the main event.It's so small. Our boy here said heordered a Christmas present and hisChristmas kit no longer works. And Ithink it was the graphics card, but 9600GPU, 16 gigs of RAM. Oh my god, thislooks like a toy. Two RGB fans righthere. Another RGB fan, two RGB fans uphere. Dude, look at this thing. What isthis piece of RAM from my miscellaneousPC parts that I will eventually use.This is what RAM here in the UnitedStates looks like. This is the RAM wegot off of T-Moon. We are getting 16gigs. I'm going to have to go doublecheck our screenshots. I know this isthe real moment of truth and what youguys are herefor. Look at that. I mean, I bet he hasjust like great personality. I mean, helooks cute. I want to give you guys aquick comparison of PCs. Okay, look atthat thing. That's like Don't talk to meor my son ever again. Now, before weturn the entire PC setup on, it is themoment of truth. Now, if you guysremember, we end up finishing off theordering segment with a mystery gift. Imean, we could be getting a watch, aflashlight, or maybe mean even a PS5. Weneed to see what we ended up getting.This is the mystery box. Wow. That isquite some shipping. Are you serious?This is it, boys. What did they say?There was a bunch of reviews. It waseither a flashlight or a watch. What arewe hoping for? I mean, a flashlightwould be sick.Ooh, suck. 401.This is definitely not worth the onestarreview. Dude, look at that thing. Andit's got, I'm guessing, 400 games builtinto one. So, we're going to be pluggingthis in. We're going to be giving it agood charge and see what games are onit. Dude, that's a little overkill for abox for that thing. Yeah, dude. Now,this may be the kicker that seals thisentire setup off.No, we're running with that. Oh, doesthis a smell? Oh my gosh. But this issupposed to be 50 ft of RGB that we'regoing to use in our setup. Now, you maybe looking at the setup right nowsaying, ""There's not 50 ft worth of RGBin there."" Oh, yes, there is. Four bucksis not bad. But we haven't turned it onyet, so I better not speak. Now that wehave finished steps one and two, it isnow time for the most important part ofthe build, which is step three, testingit all out. It's the moment of truth.Whoa. Why is it vibrating?Okay. Honestly, I'm impressed that firstof all, the chair turned out and secondof all, the PC turned on. Exciting. Oh,no. Wait, the rope light. This ropelight. It was going to look so aestheticand not like a crime scene at all. Oh,wait. Why are they on the same remote?Oh, the PC and the chair controllingboth at once. I click red and thatchanges to green. I go green, thatchanges to purple. Question is, do Iwant this PC to be able to connect to myWi-Fi? I mean, they already know youraddress. That's true. They know myappraisal value on my house, so whatmore do they need? We got the PC on.Thankfully, I did not see this. Italready comes with Windows alreadydownloaded. So, all I had to do is enterall my personal information, socialsecurity number, credit card info. Forsome reason, they wanted my mother'smaiden name. But now that we goteverything downloaded, what we're goingto be doing is going on the worldwideweb with Wow, what is the sensitivity onthis thing? And we're going to bedownloading some Marvel rivals to seehow this thing holds up,bro. It's actually kind of loud. Now,Marvel Rivals has taken years todownload, so we're testing a differenthighmaintenance game on this PC for thetime being. Dude, I'm going for thatequalizer. says I'm 38th right now.Yeah, right. Wow, you're just belowQuebec.Oh, well, that game lasted about 32seconds. Now, I know it's been weighingon you guys' mind since we've beendownloading Marvel Rivals. How is thesub 400 games in one doing? Andhonestly, was there a power button? No.Oh, we want to go for English, right?Oh, yeah. So, you have everything fromSuper Mario, Mario 14, Mario 13, Dr.Mario, Mario Bros., Turtles. You haveDonkey Kong 1, 2, and 3 and Junior.My gosh.Gosh. Good game. For what was this? $8for a mystery thing. Yeah. Everyone wasupset because all they advertised wastechnology. Tech Game Boy games. Andeveryone was getting a watch and aflashlight. Like a $2. Exactly. Thisthing might be the biggest steal of ourordering, but it's Marvel Rivals time.Let's go. My favorite part is how thescreen keeps going black.Like that. Yeah. Oh my gosh, dude. It'sfrozen.Oh my god. Connected. Oh yeah. Oh.Oh my gosh. It's so loud. Oh my gosh.Punisher is on nothing right now. Yeah,he is. He's just chilling there, youknow. We are getting 70 to 80 fps on a1080p monitor. And again, this is out ofgame. Now we've dropped down to like 6465ish in game. So even with this monitorat 180 Hz refresh rate, you can't evenuse that to the full capabilities cuzyou're maxed out at 60. But let's seewhat actually happens when you get likeinto a battle scene. Yeah, that workedout well. 48 FPS. It's great. How's thekeyboard and mouse hold? Um it's alittle slippery without something, youknow? I'm just so glad that I get tolisten to the game through my chair.That's probably my favorite part.Temperature on the PC is still good.Like fans are keeping this nice and cooleven though the PC is struggling.There's a little heat on the top, so Ifigured that's where the exhaust fansare. Standing, sitting, pink chair,speakers, doesn't matter. I can tellyour mouse is getting stuck a lot. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But at the end of theday, is the Teimue Tech here reallyworth the onestar review? All right.Rapid fire review. Chair, I'm going togive this a four out of five. It wasgoing to be a three out of five, butjust because they put in a massagingback rest, we're going to give them afour out of five. So, we got to givethem that extra star. Mouse andkeyboard. I got to give that like 1.5out of five. Now, I know both of thesecombined was only $15, but they werevery, very difficult to use. Now,monitor overall, actually, this is goingto be quite a steal. I got to give this4.5 out of five on the stars. It wouldhave gotten a 10. I just couldn't findthe screw in the beginning, and that'sdefinitely not my fault. Now, when itcomes to the desk, the desk overall, Imean, for a little over 100 bucks, I'mgoing to give this one a 3.5 out offive. I don't like the dividing naturedown the middle right there. If theywould have sealed that, it would havebeen like a 4.5 out of five. What couldyou ask for for you know a little over100 bucks? Now the PC. Why are youtouching it like that? Okay, dude.Honestly, I'm going to give this afourst star rating out of five. Now, Iknow it struggled on Marvel Rivals alittle bit and a Gario. And a Gario. Butwhen you think of a $400 PC that alsocomes with a mouse, keyboard, and mousepad, may I let you know? You're probablyunder $400 for this PC. And still to beable to play Marvel Rivals on that, Imean, that's pretty killer. Now, would Iuse something like this PC? No, Iwouldn't. So, the Teimu setup was goodoverall, but if you want to see what asetup like this looks like from Walmart,you can check that video out here. So, Iappreciate you guys, and we'll see youon the next one.[Music]","10:40 2 RAM sticks are identical if you remove the heatsink
Nah my broke ass would be using this setup
Two things I saw. The monitor was 100Hz refresh rate yet you received a 180Hz, and the GPU stated it was an RX580 16GB. There is no such thing as a RX580 with 16GB. They were made with only 4GB or 8GB configurations. Great video! Enjoyed it!
The ram was funny cause I bet that the big white corsair is just the same stick as the other. They made them taller to make it easier to sit in smaller boards now that pcs are very tight and no longer huge.
That huge box for that little 400 in 1
A temu ad just popped up
Don’t talk to me or my son ever again got me rolling 11:02
“It’s called surround sound quin.” Best line in the vid.
10:55, you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
4:20 I thought the desk wasn’t gonna show but hey I was wrong it showed up
The turning on the pc part scared me lol
That's actually not bad
The screen suddenly turning off while playing a game is simply caused by the keyboard you bought. My friend has the same problem. The same thing happens to him. If you change the keyboard, this problem will not occur.Good video i enjoyed that
It's been a pretty long time since I last watched your videos. You're so underrated, the video quality is so good for someone with 131k subs
i sold DDR 3 monster with 16GB, ASUS 970 pro gaming AURA, SSD and RX 580 for only 200$ last year
Yo I thought this video had like 24k likes, heavily underrated video
bro yoi look like the lost brother of Vitaly.
I say this with all my sincerity, you have a very good YouTube channel
Better than my 500 dollar aliexpress pc (ryzen 5 5600x, 32gb ram, GT 1030)
It looks like this temu set up looks better than my set up ️
At least the monitor has the ""Tilt function for smooth gaming"". Because we all know not being able to tilt your monitor is almost always the cause of latency and stutters in games.
9:45 did you just use a GPU to open the box LOL
Can u show us the true specs of the pc when u got it please ?
If you don’t want it I would lovely take it to start with my gaming channel
oohhh, mystery boxes...*breaks out my shovel and digs my grave* Remember, pink is the new blue...
You need to lower the monitors refresh rate for it to stop going black
Wait is that the guy who does backflips
The screen going black issue could be because of a very cheap display port cable. I bought a cheap one once and this is exactly what happened, it even caused my PC to crash
First time seeing your video, instantly subscribed. The review was so damn put together and y'all were so funny 
Highly underrated
that case is kind of nice and small footprint
i started watching your video, and temu ad popped up
I don’t know if u have a 5 stars build from temu, but I want to see it
Very underrated
8:17 GAMING CHIAR
Call me crazy but that leg-rest on the chair might actually come in handy if used by a small kid who cant reach the floor.
i like when he said his favourite mouse is the black and white one
Wait zealouss best friend?
Buyer : bad product, doesn't even turn on 
Him : add to cart
can bet mine is worse
6:18 I see what you did there “gofawk yourself 🫵”
Mann!! I Love it when He do that funny pose 4:25
Anyone notice how all the options say local due to the tariffs temu had now gone down the drain
Came out of nowhere with high quality video damn
14:29 I HAVE THIS
The desk was a 2 star review from a 1 star seller.
In our region ALL Temu listings have 5 Star and great reviews like it is fake for all products,
Good to know in other region there is honest rated products of temu
I really need something like this atleast for now
Would you mind Please give me your personal computer because I need it for my studies.
I hope their slogan is: Gawfalk yourself!
thats why ill never trust and buy from temu
The moment bro gave that reaction with that ram I instantly knew he does not know a lot about pcs. Those who know knows what I'm talking about
11:43 wait a minute I have the exact same one but yellow, got it a gift from my grandma
Marvel rival's could have ran better if the ram was upgraded to dual channel
6:29 asus monitors include dvi also. Who use dvi anyway
nice vid ! btw u say 60 fps is pretty good while im playing roblox with everything off on 50 fps ;-;
I just subscribed. And This was well edited, and made me laugh
This channel is underrated!
That chair is shockingly cute
$400 for a PC with a RX 480 is quite pricey. :)
They probably sell those cards for $50 on eBay second hand, which is without a doubt where it came from lol.
Ihave the same system unit
Your gaming setup is better than mine,oww i forgot i don't have one
That temu pc is far better than ma core i5 from 2012 3rd gen nice video btw
Did my guy really just open the pc box with a gpu lmao
Ngl I would take that set up like it's my dream set up better than my phone
This is the highend pc in our country
Yeh
Sadly temu dont have pcs in my country.
I wanted to see what PCs they have xD
Did TEMU got sponsor all of this just for a video? That would be more interesting to know about it.
More temu pls but with good stuff like good quality stuff. Like good keybord and mouse
For 1000$ on Temu you can buy PC on Threadripper 7995WX and 4 RTX 5090.
Can I have that?
Albino u on Crack for buying this 1 star junk
Bro used the GPU to open the box
why you unboxed it with a grafiks card
can i have that pc?
Try 1000$ microcenter
I love you guys
Need the link for gaming table
This is peak PC
bro, just give me that graphics card instead of turning it into a boxcutter HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Gaming chair is crazy lil bros
I think why is the PC is not working is because it’s from another country and the electricity is way more powerful than the United States
bro open the box with gpu
Hello. What is the name of the PC case? I really liked it.
“That’s what you get for buying a pc off of Temu” not really lol, the gift should work properly at least if it’s on a website like this
great review on teemo fact all your stuffs ordered recieved :D
Bro next thing you are building is my new pc(PLSSSS)
I would really appreciate with that
It's my first time seeing the price on temu it's kinda expensive for a bad quality products
Next time get 1 star items that are described as poor quality, not just they never arrived
05:17 this whole interaction was just.. flawless.
Wait is Quinn in this video
That's not bad all from Temu tbh
Now we need a one star review from Amazon
Are you giving out that gaming PC
CAN I GET THE PC CAN MONITOR?
is everyone ignorig the fact bro is using a gpu to open the boxes
This pc is so cool
I don find the pc
one thing i bought that same keyboard for less then 10$ at 5 below
I like the part where you told us the specs of the pc

I cover Tech, Desk Setups, Gaming Gear, and am a HUGE fellow nerd as well. Thank you for visiting my channel and I hope I can earn your subscription!",hmm camera's crooked what if I justthis video is sponsored by vernalearlier this yearI had to say goodbye to my desk setup of 4 yearsit was really really toughbecause I invested so much time and money into itand having to tear it all downit was kind of depressingthankfully I have a new and improved desksetup that I want to share with you guysthis is David your casual nerdlet's go ahead and check it outsince I knew I was starting from scratchI really wanted to extend my desk spacein the previous setup I already had a 72 inch deskthat was already plenty of real estatebut I was aiming for something different this yearthat's where vernal came in clutch and sent me overtheir walnut L shaped deskset up time was about an hour and a halfand that was just metaking my time to make sure everythingwas set up correctly got it oh yeahI opted for the integrated drawerthat just installs into the deskwith a few screw holeseverything's already pre drilled for the installationI also opted for wheelsbecause I am not trying to break my backone of my biggest concerns with the deskwas the weight capacitydue to the desk having three motorsit has a weight capacity of 350 poundsgetting the desk to wobble in any kind of major way wasreally difficult it was mainly the monitors movingI feel pretty safe about thisnot to mention there's an anti collision systemsafe to say that it workedand I did test it a couple times for safe measurethe height adjustable range is 26 inchesup to 49.6 inches and we have three memory key slotsperfect for a low medium and high settingand I also likewhen you're raising or lowering the deskit starts off slow and then gains speedabout 1.5 inches per secondthe desk is perfectand it's exactly what I was looking forsomething to split up my two setupsgaming and productivityI also added the vernal file cabinetand the side cabinetit was about time that I got rid of my Alex drawerthat thing was starting to look a little suspectI got the tall version of the file cabinetit came with the lockable castersand it even includes a key lockfor added security and peace of mindon the bottom drawer nowthe side cabinet was a lot shorterso it could actually fit under the deskinstead of doing that thoughI put this really cool mini fridge on topjust to keep a couple of drinks on the standbyand the side cabinet also does feature that lockingdrawer both of the cabinets come in the samematching color as the deskthis makes me really happybecause I don't have to worryabout mismatching colorsthe desk selection was super important this yearand I'm so glad that I found the vernal deskI understand this video is sponsored by thembut I am genuinely in love with this productit's not changing anytime soonprices start at $389and you guys can use the exclusive codeytst to get an extra 6% off your orderin my previous setupI had a really hard time separating the gamingfrom the productivitysince everything was on one monitorit was just way too easy to switch over to gamingwhen I really should have been editingor doing something more productiveand when I knew I had to moveI for sure wanted to get an L shaped deskbecause I had this vision planned for a long timeso let me show you guys my solutionthe hardest choice of the gaming setup was the monitorI knew I wanted to go oledbut do I go with the W OLED with a matte screenthe Cutie o lid with a glossy onehow many frames 14 forty p resolution or do I go 4Kmy answer came when I attended CES 2025just seeing everybody's oled offeringsmy answer was the Asus PG thirty two ucdmit's a 4K 240 hertz 2D OLEDand I also got the matching monitor armthe reason why I did go with this monitoris because of those crazy looking colorsin the W OLED and its matte screenyou lose a lot of that contrastthat OLED brings to the gamewith the QD OLED you gain the glossy screenso there isn't any kind of grainy filter over itbut it is Reflection Cityso if you decide to go with something like thisjust be aware of that nextI want to talk about the new speakersfor the gaming setupsince the monitor doesn't have any in built speakersthese are the Edifier Q65 speakerswhy did I choose these it's really simple you guysthey just look incrediblethe speakers have a 32 millimeter driver for trebleand a 70 millimeter driver for the mid and lowall of your controls are on the right sidevolume power and lighting controlsit also has Gant charger capabilitiesthis comes in handywhenever you need to charge anythingat a decent speed the sound quality is really goodthese aren't studio monitorsand they're not meant to be studio monitorsthey're desktop speakers with high quality soundand they're just fun to useI will say they do lack in the lowsso adding a sub onto this would be a perfect matchthe times where I don't wanna use the speakersand I wanna use the mic to chat with my partythe headset I've been using is the RazerBarracuda X Chromait's a really solid headset with 40 millimeter drivers50 hours of battery life a prettydecent mic for the price hellohello testing 12 3this is the Razer Barracuda X Chroma mictest testing 1 23 testing 12 3 and of course Razer Chroma Lightingit's perfect for playing any kind of single player gameand really good for playing multiplayer gameslike Marvel Rivalsnext let's talk about the keyboardthe one I've been using for a while is the Gravistar K1Pro if you were to make cyberpunk into a keyboardthis would be itwe have these claw risers that adjust the heightthis volume rocker that can also mute audiokale switches with 45 grams to activatean eight thousand million power batteryif you want to use this with Bluetoothor with the receiveralso the build of this keyboard is really solidI found it to be pretty lightbut also heavy at the same timeand so many other features that I just can't get intoin this videothe mouse that I'm using is the Razer Viper MiniSpecial Editionreally the best mouse that Razer has ever madeAK polling super lightand just an overall beast of a mousewhenever you're gamingif they could take this design into the regular Viperwithout adding too much weightI think it would be the perfect mouseand as for the accessoriesI have the Razer USB 4 docklet's add some frontIo for easy access whenever I need to plug ina mouse or charge my keyboardit gives me plenty of portsand the USB 4 speeds are top notchand my last accessory is the Devoom TimescapeI've seen these on Instagram on so many pagesand I see why because of the added utilityyou can customize this in their appand you have a super wide selection of optionsmy favorite is the YouTube subscriber counterand alsothis utility that monitors your usage for your GPUand CPU timeskateis a really cool accessorythat I didn't expect to have on my deskbut I'm glad it's there last but not least is my PCthe case is the H9 Elite from NZXTit perfectly displays all of my PC partsthe motherboard is an Asus ROG Strix X5 70a Ryzen 50900 x 32 gigs of RAM and a 30 80 Ti Founders Editionthe PC really does serve me welleven though it's a couple of generations oldI do wanna upgrade this yearbut the scalper prices of everything is justit's really depressingand that's the gaming setup for this yearhonestly it's the most exciting part of my setupbut equally as important is my productivity setupso with this oneI basically took my old setup from my old apartmentand recreated it hereeverything is almost exactly the same monitorwhich is the LG 38WN95C it's an ultra wide monitorwith a ton of real estate for editingand it runs at 144 hertzNext is the brains of the operationand that's my M1 Max 16 inch MacBook Proeverything is fully maxed out minus the SSD drivesstill an amazing laptop and no signs of slowing downthe keyboard I'm using is the key K3 Prowhy I chose thisis because it has every single functionI would need for the Mac the dialthe customizable macro padsand the Mac optimized shortcutsI also spent about four hours customizingand lubing the switches so it's butterysmooth and sounds amazinglastlythe mouse that I'm using is a Logitech G5 0 2 x pluswhy I still continue to choose this mouseis the feeland the ergonomics are close to the MX Master 3but it has theresponsiveness and the connectivity of a gaming mouseand the solution for the MX Master 3scroll wheel is the Magic Trackpadwith these two paired together with the keyboardI have full customizability of this MacBookCaldigit TS four helps with connectivityreally makes this whole setup workThe Scarlet Solo helps my Road MT one mic connectand my Bayer Dynamic DT 770 Pro X's help me monitor all of my audiowhen I wasdeciding how to lay out the productivity setupI just realized that I had it perfectand even better now that my gaming setup is behind meI no longer get distractedwhenever I'm doing my productivitytasks so that's really it for the desk setupstwo super optimizedplaces where I can do gaming and productivityat its maximum level and againmake sure to use the code y t s t to get that extra sixsend off your order the last but not leastimportant addition to this is the lightingsince I now have dark colored wallslighting is really hard to come byand what I mean by that isthat light is not bouncingall across this room anymoreso the lighting options in this room are even moreimportantthe first way I improved it was adding smart blindsto the studiothese are the dual roller shades from Gray Windthese motorized beauties can becontrolled right from your phoneor through voice commandswith an Alexa or Google Homethese specific ones are controlled through matterand it implements with Apple Home Kit perfectlythey're super quietrun on rechargeable batteries that last monthsand the installation is surprisingly simpleplus they come in different sizes and stylesto match any kind of decorI opted for the dual mortar shadesthe bottom layer lets the light inwhile the top layer is a blackoutperfectfor those days where I need to control the lightingand for the late night sessionsthat's where my Phillips Hue lights come insay what you want about the hue lightsthey are expensive but in my opinion and in myown usage they have the most stable connectionout of any other smart lights out therealso with the ecosystem of the lights that they havethey'll have everything that you'll needbecause of the Hue Bridgethe connectivityand the responsiveness is just the bestand not to mention the home kitconnectivity with your phone is just top tieranother lighting system that I like to use is Nano Leaffor the gaming setupI have these nano leaf black trianglessplash of color that this adds onto the setupreally makes it stand outthese lights also work from home kitsso it makes them really easy to usethe quality of the lightsand just the overall looksis what keeps me coming back to Nano Leaf lightsthese are gonna be some changesand some future plans that I do haveso the biggest contention with this setupthe walls make everything really really darknow I did plan for thisand I introduced a whole bunch of new lightingthat's different from the previous setupbut I didn't expect for the walls to absorbso much of my light soI do have some plans to add some more lightingaround the studioit's just gonna help accent the room even moreand I am a sucker for that soft lightingso aside from the lightingthere's another thing I do want to changeand it is that monitor back there on the productivitysetup I do have an ultra wide monitor 38 inchesbut I do have my eyes on that studio displayeveryone I've talked toin the space of content creationhas had glowing reviews nowI do knowI'm gonna be giving up a lot of screen real estatebut that monitor is packing 5K resolution60 hertz so I don't know how I feel about thatamazing speakersand a webcam that I can use for meetingsin my opinionit just looks to be one of the best monitorsfor a content creatorso let me know down in the comments belowif you think I should make that changeand the last additionthat I'm thinking about is adding a pegboardonto the empty space on that wall over thereI already have a couple of pegboards along the wayso that's gonna be solved really soonso aside from those minor gripeshonestly you guys I just I'm in love with this placeI've been extremely productiveever since I built it outin the previous place it was a rented apartmentso I wasn't able to do muchhere I'm able to hang whatever I wantdo whatever I wantand that's just you can't put a price on that freedomI'm gonnabe releasing a studio vlog video in the futureand that's just gonna show how I turned a really dustyold bedroom into my dream studioso you're gonna wanna subscribe andstay tuned for that so watch this next videoif you're interested in my last studio touror watch this video for Desk Setup 2024thank you for watching you guysthis is David serving you a little side of techand I'll see you in the next video God bless you guys,"Leave me a suggestion on links you guys! I know I have a ton of products in this video so I might've missed some
You utilize the L-Shape desk to its fullest! Great dual setup, looking forward to the makeover vid.
We've been waiting for this for a while! That gaming setup is sick, I love the monitor.
The L Shape desk looks cool! Awesome new setup man!
Fire setup brother!!
Let’s go!!! Finally, something I can watch while I have my lunch today
devastated I can't get Vernal gear here in Australia! it all looks gorgeous.
Dope setup my guy!
I am also setting Myntrading office and set up. Great video
The mini fridge is a must for me lol
I would potentially wait on the Studio Display to see if Apple announces a new one at WWDC, or alternatively to see what other manufacturers come up with on the 5K alternatives this year. It's what I'm doing. My current monitor works just fine for me, I'll wait until at least 90Hz minimum comes en masse to 5K.
That monitor is ART
Nice video love it on my way my desktop setup this year
if you're into manifestation but feeling confused by all the different methods out there... this book Vibrations of Manifestation explains everything through actual quantum mechanics. started yesterday and already seeing things differently. the frequency method makes so much sense when you understand the science behind it. finally feel like I get how this actually works
Great video! Keep the awesome stuff coming
Starting my youtube channel soon, unfortunately, I'll need to steal your entire setup, this is impeccable! Don't worry, I'll use your affiliate links lol!
Never understood why any L-shaped standing desks have one side shorter than the other. Just make them with equal sides.
The Apple logo on your MacBook looks so real. Like so realistic
just a heads up, you already know this probably but don't leave your oled monitor on for aesthetic due to their burn in tendencies
I feel like you can get a better monitor than that. 5k resolution doesn't mean squat, and you have other options for webcam and speakers
Seeing a thermoelectric fridge hurts my soul. That thing probably uses as much electricity as your whole gaming rig.
Shoutout to Eddie!!
Looks amazing! What are the desk dimensions?
meditation teacher here. been studying manifestation for years but the way Vibrations of Manifestation explains it through quantum physics is completely different. it fills in all the gaps in traditional manifestation teaching. seeing my students get clarity they never had before. this book is genuinely helping people understand how reality creation actually works
What is the large rectangular light on your productivity setup?
What is the monitor riser and MacBook dock you are using? I like that they both go with the desk!
Bro, this is insane! Could you quickly calculate the total cost of all of them?
Link to wall slats?
How can I get that live wallpaper you’re using? Looks so cool
This one is for the algorythm
Would you mind linking that arcane wallpaper?
I wish the L shaped desk came in all black
So.................can we get a gallery of the space wallpapers, please???
What are the dimensions of the Vernal desk? Thanks so much!!
Do you happen to know the height of the lower compartments of the side cabinet when the drawers are not installed?
I'm wondering if I can place some ring binders in there which are usually 31.5cm tall.
Would you ever get a Mac mini?
what the mini frigde 
you have
What which size did you get? I'm looking to get the 80 by 72
hey where u get dat wallpaper from
coming from a science background I always thought manifestation was bs. but kept seeing people talk about this book Vibrations of Manifestation. decided to test the quantum field method with small things first. started noticing exactly what the book described - subtle shifts, increased clarity, opportunities I would've missed before. the scientific explanation finally bridges the gap between quantum physics and practical manifestation
looks good, i just dont understand how can someone game on a 16:9 in 2025.... specially when there are awesome oled ultrawide monitors out there......

i mean... if it was me, i'd change that old-school 16:9 granny monitor out immediately, 

otherwise everything else looks good.
Hope U didn't get that 5k monitor. And an iPhone camera is way better quality. Google how to configure it to be a webcam and the best stand to use for it
I wish i wasn't born in lower middle class with such desires...
razer products are sheit, own many all of them all fall apart after some time
ok weird request but can someone who's read Vibrations of Manifestation dm me? started the book last week and have questions about the quantum field chapter... like did anyone else notice their dreams getting super vivid after trying the frequency technique? or am I just trippin lol. need to compare notes because some wild synchronicities happening and none of my friends are into this stuff. first manifestation book that actually explains the science and I'm kinda shook at how it's working

I have a lot ofdifferent devices in my setup fromcustom LED lighting, neon fans, PCparts, and keyboards. And in order tocontrol all of that, I need multipleapps, which is honestly really annoying.Now, the fix to this is one single app,SignalRGB. This syncs all your RGBdevices, and it supports over a 100brands. This is the device page. Itshows everything I currently have linkedup. Multiple GOI lights, my Razerkeyboard, fans, RAM, and motherboard. IfI click on each one of these, you cansee it highlights them individually likethis. In order to customize it, all youneed to do is go to the library andselect a theme. It comes with hundredsof free lighting effects like this, andthey look awesome. But if you want totake it even further, you can pay fivebucks a month to access even morefeatures, including reactive effects forgames like Fortnite. So when somethinghappens in the game, cool things likethis happen. Now, go fix your RGB. Youcan find the link in my bio.","Openrgb is open source alternative
The best setup I have ever seen
Does it work on Linux?
Cool room
Not a single part of my pc changed, and I thought asrock would be supported but nothing happened
The ads in signalrgb are annoying
But it stops working when i click off the app
Well, i have the Smart TV 3 Lite, and it doesn't show up at all...
There are more things i have that are supposed to work with SignalRGB that don't show up at all, mousepad too, keyboard WAS supported, still kind of is, but after a little bit it just turns off all of the LEDs and doesn't come on again unless i do so myself.
Don’t work on phones yet
Sadly it doesn't work with my Spectrix S40G ssd and that's a deal-breaker to me
What monitor are you using as main in this setup ? 45"" LG OLED? and is it better than 49"" for gaming? what about your pc specs please?
What's the brand of your gaming monitor ?
Do you have 3 gpu just sitting there will I still have a 1050 ti
WHAT KINDA PC IS THAT

Opa Dantic, como vai? Espero que bem. Eu moro no Brasil e meu sonho é trabalhar como desenvolvedor de jogos e aplicativos, porém aqui a coisa está meio complicada na economia, não tenho computador e fui ver para montar um novo, porém irá sair no valor de 6,500. É muito dinheiro, trabalho à noite em escala 6x1 e sinto que isso tem me matado um pouco a cada dia, não tenho conseguido guardar dinheiro pois ajudo minha mãe em casa com as despesas. Gostaria muito se você pudesse realizar esse meu sonho de poder ter um PC novo para desenvolver jogos.

But right now, the monitor isonly running at 60 Hz, which is not fastenough. You need to have peakperformance gaming on here, even withthe free PC. I kind of forgot the HDMIcable to support a different refreshrate. So, I need to find another one.Okay, I just found another one. Andunfortunately, it is somehow broken. Allright, new day, new cable. And this oneactually claims to be high speed. So,let's see if I can actually turn up therefresh rate. Nope, it's still 60 Hz.I'm trying to update the drivers, butthe Wi-Fi is so slow. It's literally 700kilobytes a second. All right, itfinally downloaded. Let's see if it doesanything. What about now? Let's see. 60Hz. It's still 60 Hz. Yeah, I have noidea. I'm temporarily giving up. Allright, I figured it out. It's the minidisplay port to HDMI adapter. It onlysupports 1080p 60 Hz. Luckily, I have adifferent one that may or may not workbetter. We are still stuck in 60 Hz.","use displayport, displayport is how most people get all their hertz
It also depends on the hdmi version.
It’s got to be indeedly that adapter you got it’s actually limiting the refresh rate to 60 hz only
It depends on your monitor too.
A lot of monitors you gotta lower the resolution to get higher refresh rates (especially CRTS and Gaming monitors)
i get 75hz over DVI and dvi to hdmi adapters so it's not the generation for lower high refresh rates
That 700 kbs is my average internet speed
check if your graphics card can even handle 100hz. if it does, then get a new 100hz miniDP-hdmi adapter.
My average internet speed is 700kb
I don’t even know if that monitor can handle any more than 60hz. That thing looks like a budget friendly off-brand office pc. I’d be surprised if it does anymore than 75hz at most.
if displayport doesnt work use CRU you can add your own HZ options just dont go too high or else your monitor will break (restart needed to add the option)
There’s three dependency’s for “high” refresh rate you need to make sure the plug on the monitor supports it same with the actual cable and the gpu plug itself if one of the three components doesn’t support it, it’s not going to work
I like how this guy never give up
Disable any and all power efficiency modes, G-Sync/FreeSync settings, ELMB options. Then check your refresh rate options once again.

Install ViewSonic INF drivers.

For further troubleshooting, please respond to this comment with your specifications. All I need additional info on is; Monitor, GPU, motherboard, CPU, HDMI Version, Windows version.
having a lower resolution will sometimes allow you to have a higher refresh rate, maybe give that a try?
Integrated graphics sometimes has Hz limit like 1080p 60hz even tho ur monitor may be 1080p 100hz you can try to add a different gpu and see if it works
It could be the port on the PC because it's a pretty old one
Amd's FSR can also cap you at 60hz. Turn that off
Use CRU and just make sure to remain in the cable bandwidth limits
Overclock your screen
I also noticed you have an adapter....that is not going to work, just plug it straight into the gpu...if your gpu doesnt have HDMI it doesnt support high refresh rates
The port itself is probably limited the GPU might not be powerful enough to run that refresh rate
what about the monitor menu you can overclock it to turn up the refresh rate
Your monitor refresh rate can also interfere with that
Bro that pc looks like from 2010 might be the reason why you are not getting high refresh rates
When a monitor won't go over 60Hz, just download the monitor's driver and install that which gonna let Windows know the actual capabilities of the connected monitor.
1 Monitor might just be 60, 2 the monitor might have a low spec hdmi and high spec dp.
The port on monitor may only do 60hz or the port on pc
Lower the screen res and you will get faster screen refresh rate.
Yeah but the gpu may not support highter refresh rates
Try setting it with CRU
You might wanna change the monitor and/or use an HDMI version that supports that monitor.
The GPU simply doesn't have a good enough HDMI version for it...
Check if the GPU's mDP version can handle high refresh rates. If it does, get a mDP-HDMI adapter that supports 100Hz or more.
try the CRU which some gamers use for overclocking monitor resolutions
If its going throw a converter most of them won't let it go higher then it can
It might even be in the port, or since this is a ""free pc"", it might be the gpu
It may be the port on the mother board
Use custom resolution utility
Its the cpu, since its an old cpu it does not support higher refresh rates
It could be the port on the monitor, try using a displayport cable if possible
Some monitors only have their maximum refresh rate if you use display port same thing happened to me and I switched to DisplayPort
it depends on the resolution
Ion think thats a cable problem brotha
GPU needs to support 100hz, monitor needs to aswell, HDMI Version may be off, or just use displayport.
60 hz monitor?
700kb ain’t that slow for me
It’s likely the motherboard stopping it from reaching
Does the monitor even support more than 60Hz???
You got to put the monitor at a 45° angle, remember a²+b²=c²?
Just get an Vga Cable It Supports upto 180hz
Go in amd software and click in custom resolution and change 60 to 100
It is because of mini dp to hdmi that you get only 60hz
the monitor: Hi i'm 60hz
It weird that it only outputs 60hz im guessing its the adapter or the driver missing for the monitor I did saw viewsonic website having some for their monitors. My old rx550 had dvi and I used a DVI to hdmi cable and did get 75hz on my old monitor.
It might be possible for you to overclock the monitor. I went from 60hz on my laptop to 95hz
Maybe the PC just cant do 60 hertz cause the hdmi port version is too old
it's probably since the gpu sucks, so it can't output more than 60hz
You should take down the resolution,to 900p or 720p,and then you should be able to set it to 75hz.
Use CRU = Custom resolution utility

transform this currentempty room into the ultimate jeel gamingroom because about a month ago mygirlfriend and I moved house and sincethen this has pretty much been ourgaming setup it's not the best so overthe next 5 days I'm going to completelytransform this room into the ultimateJewel gaming setup complete withincredibly powerful PCS some of the mostHightech gaming accessories and ofcourse incredibly cool lighting designsthis is going to be the best gaming roomI've ever built on this channel and mymost expensive but there's anotherreason as to why I'm building it so thisis my beautiful fianceé Emily werecently just moved house and in 5 daysit's Emily'sbirthday so I thought it would be areally cool idea is if in those 5 days Imake literally the craziest dual gamingsetup for your birthday and then on yourbirthday we just spend all day playinggames there that sounds that would beamazing inredible that would be amazinghowever you aren't allowed to go in theroom so you've got to disappear so Ihave got my friend Adam here to help meout with the room cuz it this is goingto be a ginormous build probably thebiggest gaming set of build I have everdone so let's go do it let's go get itdone in fact we need to go to IKEA firstlet's do that first let's do that firstnow we're heading to Ikea because mostof the products in my initial design forthis room are all Ika products so wesearched around the entire store to findeverything that we needed we needlike good few of these pair them with afew of these Alex drawerswe'll get a Mega Death and although wedid find everything that we were lookingfor one of these one of these I actuallyfound a few things I didn't even plan tobuy but I knew I had to have if thissetup was going to be the best one I'veever built I could lit do this all daybut once we found everything we werefaced with our very first problem oh myGod oh my God there's a lot of stuffhere yeah there is too there's a lot isthis going to fit this is really longit's like really long I don't this mylong now because I have a small car it'snot really designed to carry a lot ofIkea furniture have you seen my seathave you seen where I'm going to have tosit yeah you're going to you're going tohave to sit in there it was funny fromthis camera you can't even see you intheback now as we make our way back home Iwant to tell you the plan of how we'regoing to make this room possible firstof all we need to fill the room withFurniture oh my God he's turning he'sturninghe's then we need to add some crazylighting oh God there's police Adamthere's place no oh and then finally weneed to add a jeal gaming setup oh myGod that was so stressful now we justhad to bring everythingin this is all the stuff that we've gotfor the room to build today this is themost Ikea furniture I've ever boughtwhere do you even start what I thinkthis will be easy bang it out a coupleof hours Red Bull come on oh my godlet's start with the drawers[Music]instructions oh Adam it's happened againevery time I'm here every single timethe instructions always go out thebloody window anyways enough messingabout let's put these deskstogether push that over here this deskis going to behuge oh this is going to look sick thatis Mega desk bro you could get like aracing Sim in here I don't know if youcould I reckon you could okay all thedesks have been put together we've gotthis huge l-shape my setup's going to gohere Emily's setup's going to go hereand sort of over here it looks reallycool however we're not finished on dayone just yet we have still got to buildthe chairs so let's go get them Adam nowluckily for us see who had kindly sentout two of their finest chairs to put inthis setup wao special gloves let's getthese out this one lookswhite oh that isnice they smell good the chairs did infact smell good and you know what theywere easy to put together as well we didthem in about 15 minutes but none ofthat really matters if they're notcomfortable to sit on okay me and Adamhave both built our chairs Let's testout if we're going to use them let'sgo o now this is all right this is all ylook at this this is actually all rightohW oh this is good oh man I can fallasleep right here now I actually mightnow the main chair that see who sent uswas the Doro C300 Pro and I can't liethis chair looks incredible it has alumbar tracking system which providesreal time support that wraps around yourlower back it's got three differentangles for you to recline at 6Dcoordinated armrest I mean look at themthey go up down left right forward backin out there's even a tilt function thisis one of the most versatile chairs I'veever sat in and I want to thank see whofor sending it out as well as their M5 7chair which has a really nice provablemess design and also has duel andarsupport with 3D coordinated armreststhese chairs are going to lookabsolutely incredible in this setup andif you want to check any of them outI'll leave a link in the descriptionlike I said this is going to be the mostexpensive setup I've ever made so thankssee who for sponsoring this video ofmaking this happen now to round off thefirst day I added some extra support tothe mega desk and I also stuck up these3D art panels however this literallytook me all night it was really worth itthough as I feel like they give the rooma bit of depth and even though the roomstarted to actually look good it didn'tstop me from attempting to put up ashelf before I went to bed okay um it is1: in the morning I don't know if youcan tell in my voicebut I'm really tired so I'm going tosleep and carry on in themorning now on the start of day two meand Adam started to build another deskbecause believe it or not this roomisn't going to just have two setups it'sgoing to have three I'll explain lateranyways it was time to add the rest ofthe shelves look at that like a gloveright now I'm actually combining twodifferent types of Ikea shelves to getlike this really thick shelving designis that what you would call it like alike a thick shelf I don't know I had tocut some of the shelves to make them fitbut once we had done that all thefurniture was completed which means wecould move on tolighting however not all of the stuffthat I've ordered has arrived yethowever we've still got quite a few toputup yeah we're going to fill this roomwith pretty much the craziest lightingI've ever put in any room so let's putthem[Music]in this is literally just the first oneI reckon it will look even better when Iturn theseoffoh my this is one light one light I'vegot like 10 to 15 more this is going tolook good anyways the next light to addwas this crazy desk light that I couldput all the way around the deskoh my God we've only put two lights onright now I I could stop here and itwould still look incredible this isgoing to be the best setup I've evermade I can just tell but if I actuallywant to make this the best room thatI've ever made I need to get rid of oneof the worst things about thisroom the biglight you see if I just turn off everysingle light in here and I put on thelightswitch do you see what I mean it just itjust looks horrible I genuinely thinkthis might be one of the worst thingsmankind has ever invented I mean there'sthere is a few other things obviouslybut um top three at least so one I'vegot here is a Phillips hue light switchwhich is basically the exact same thingbut it's a uh a color changing bulb so Ijust get rid of thisone I should beable to change it to different colors Ibought this ginormous lamp from Ikearight when you put on it oh waa it umyeah it doesthat oh my God just like that the roomwas completely transformed with just afew lights it's honestly giving mespaceship sort of Vibes right now but Istill want to make this room better umI'm whispering because I want to stayquiet so Emily can't hear me butrealistically um I need to make thisroom look as good as possible cuz umgenuinely this Channel's success wouldnot have happened without her like someof you may know thatI've wanted to do YouTube since I was 11years old because of Emily I am nowdoing that she's generally made mydreams come true so I just want to beable to surprise her with this likecrazy room um for her birthday I need Ineed it to be good so I'm going to workthrough the night I'm going to put upsome more lights and yeah overall I feellike we've made some very good progressfor day[Music]two hello my friends it is day three andI have currently spent around about 90%of today just waiting around for Amazon[Music]packagescheers thank you very much forthat oh my God there is so many packageslet's take these upstairs because theAmazon delivery was so late it now meansthat we've got even less time to finishthis sowe really need to getstarted more lightssoundproofing next light is in O itgenuinely just keepsgetting it just keeps getting better andbetter now there was only one more Setof Lights to put up however I might havemade a slight miscalculationI I don't have enough I'm currentlybuying some and they will arrivetomorrow it just means that I'm I'mreally cutting it close so since we'reputting Lighting on hold right now weneed to move on with some other thingsnow this room currently has a problemwhen youclap there there's a bit of an echo so Ineed to reduce that by putting up theseuh foam acoustic panels so I stuck themonto the wall and not only did it givethe wall a nice design the echo was alsomassively reduced but now let's add the[Music]monitors we have got the monitor arms onwhich now means we've got to add somemonitors to them and uh let's just say Imight have gone a little bit Overkillbecause not only do we have one monitorI didn't just get two I didn't get justthree I didn't get just four I didn'tget just five I have got us six monitorsthat is three monitors each and a a lotofelectricity rip my bank account now forpeople who love Tech the top twomonitors here are 4K 27 in monitors 144Herz and all the rest are just normal27in 1080p monitors that are going to beused for other things so let's get theseopen that is nice[Music]nice and that is the six monitor this isreally starting to come along now on areal one though it isapproaching midnight uh I know I wassuper hyped to put these monitors up butnow I just know I havegot a lot to clean up likejust look at all this rubbish man I wantto go to bed butI'm going to keep doing this forly I'mgoing to just now tidy this entire placeoffand I'll see you guys in the[Music]morning good morning everyone it is dayfour and um let's just say right now Iam getting a little bit conscious oftime becauseum not everything has all right I wastaking a walk with Emily earlier and Iasked her what is the one thing thatshe's kind of really expecting from thiswhole setup and she said as long as Iget a PC considering you gave my lastone away to a subscriber it's finelisten I'll get you a new pc it'll bethe best PC you've everseen they haven't arrived yet andEmily's birthday is in 2 days however umsome other stuff did arrive today whichis the Nano Leaf lights and some moremonitor arms so at least we've gotsomething to work on today so I startedadding the extra monitor arms and justas i f I was making someprogress okay we have a slight problemum I've realized there's not there's nota lot of like leg room here I can onlyjust barely fit in this place theproblem is I've used Too Many Alexdrawers and I've got to get rid of onewithout the entire setup collapsing ohthat nearly messed everything up I'mpretty much playing the setup equivalentof Jenga I don't like this apart from ifI mess up here Emily is not going tohave any monitors you guys have no ideahow tricky this is in the end though Imanaged it the next thing on my to-dolist is to fix the Nano Leafpanels okay the lights now should be alldone so let's plug themin yo oh myGod this this generally might be thebest setup I have honestly ever made Iam so happy right now we've only justnow completed the lighting stage so ifthat crossed off the the list we'reactually on track to finishing thisbefore Emily's birthday let me justconfigure these and we can finally TurnAll the Lights On but it's when Istarted configuring them that we hadanother problem okay we havea a serious serious problem trying toget the Nano Leaf lights to sink up tomy phone they just won't work the oneson the right here just seem to be faultyas I spent the past 3 hours trying toset them up but they just wouldn't workI even went into my garage to see ifthere was any on Leaf lights but I foundnothing basically now midnight Iliterally spentlike 7 hours trying to get them all toconnect and link up and it just won'twork I've done it hundreds of timesbefore I've been on literally everyReddit post I've been on every onlineform just trying to figure out I'm justgoing to have to um sort lighting out onthe final day then I[Music]guess it is the last day before Emily'sbirthday so I've got basically all oftoday to try and finish off this room Idon't really know if everything's goingto arrive today but judging by the waythings are going I might have to try andextend the deadline to like later in theday on her birthday but yeah we we'vegot to get started now today is the daywhere we add in basically all of thegaming setup accessories I've got somany things to add in here first thingwe're putting in is these white speakersthat match perfectly with the setup andthen we've also got these matchingWireless Logitech headphones this isprobably the most expensive setup I'vemade because everything that I have tobuy I have to buy two of them we've evengot some Led headset stands so thatthese headsets have a place to sit we'veeven got a white microphone arm to gowith a brand new sha mv7 whitemicrophone now we're not really usingthis for gaming it's going to be morefor voiceovers like the one you'rehearing now in fact this is the exactmicrophone that I'm currently speakinginto and you can probably tell I sound alot better anyway now it's time forkeyboards now for me I've gone with thislike I don't even know what it's calledH I75 I don't even know I saw itand itjust oh and it's white and blue so Ithought it would be perfect for Emily'skeyboard we're going with this pink epermaker one which I put in her last setupbut it's it's that good we've got to putit in this one and for the mouse we'regoing with the best mouse in the worldthe MX Master 3s again though I've hadto get two of these which is um uh thisvideo has been so expensive I tookanother shot of trying to fix thelighting on the wall but then I had anunexpected guest[Music]arrive oh look who decided to turn up ohM oh I missed it I missed a little bitof this haven't I just a bit yeah comeand help me out man what's your what'syour first impressions thisis so clean now remember when I saidearlier that I was building a thirdsetup we still need to add things intothat as it's currentlywell it hasn't got anything in it sowe've actually got a Mini PC that'sgoing in here nice little Keyon keyboardhypx mouse speakers and you know how Ialso said earlier that I'd got sixmonitors that was a a lie again I gotseven so that that's the seventh monitornow oh God this setup is purely going tobe used for dumping Youtube footage ontoand it's also going to be a spare setupif anyone else wants to game with us butanyways forget about that Emily's new PChas just arrived this is Emily's PC butwe actually do have another one of thesecoming the problem is I ordered thesePCS on separate dates so we do haveanother one of these coming you're justgoing to have to imagine right now thatthere is another one right here becausethere is one coming now these PCS aretough of the line I went all out on thespecs of these mainly because I did giveEmily's last PC away to a subscriber butthis thing is is better than anythingshe's ever had before these are thespecs literally it's top of the line itit cost around about three grand andwe've got two of them anyways added somefinal touches like Emily's iPad andmicrophone and I even got us some customXbox Pro controllers these things areabsolutely insane we've never played onPro controllers before but just holdingthis thing in my hands I know 100% it'sgoing to enhance our gaming experienceand of course I've got myself a matchingone for myself and as we added them itbecame midnight it literally just becameEmily's birthday anduh she's just sat there editing Emily'sactually working on a video right nowwhich we want to make when we hit 500ksubscribers which will be to open thefirst ever free gaming store for a daywe really want to make this video so hitsubscribe if you want to see that happenanyways it's time for the final[Music]day now the Kickstart off the final daywe have had a huge delivery from theguys at technically stable these guyshonestly make some of the most craziestMouse mats I've ever seen in my life Imean just look at how cool that's goingto look in the setup oh that is perfectoh yes this is probably my favoriteMouse M design I've ever seen in my lifebut whilst I was showcasing off thismouse mat I Got a

what look howtall you are I forgot you're you'resmaller and look how little I am just goon reach reach go onthis some small people problems sowhilst I took Emily for a deliciousbirthday meal Adam had to crack on andget the lights off the only problem wasoh my yeah no that's that's that's notgoing to happen I literally can't reachit happy birth toyou I've gotit once Adam had fixed the height

much formaking it literally the perfect setuplike ever it's all right now my birthdayis literally in s days so like you knowwhat what are you gettingme uh[Applause],"What a sick video Dantic. Feel like I've been on the adventure with you the whole time, and the whole story with your fiance makes me feel the emotion you felt while making this room. 

I've been there so many times where everything goes so smoothly, until something goes wrong and then you're 8 hours deep with still no idea how to fix it, but good on you for persevering as the lighting looks amazing, especially that pendant! Sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to reveal the problem. I'm doing the same office renovation and it's just so tiring sometimes, up till 1am either painting or moving stuff around, so I can definitely empathise with the struggles and the toll it takes on you.

You certainly deserve way more subs, and I hope you make more of these videos in the future!
Glad to see that whilst being so kind to all these people he still treats himself and his girlfriend. Keep it up Dantic I'm loving the vids!
I remember from a previous vid that she liked the white better with only touches of pink and love that it got remembered (as an icon like Dan would lol). Happy late Birthday Emily!!
Hey Dantic!
Huge fan here I'm 27 and have always been passionate about gaming. Your content really speaks to people like me who dream big but are limited by what we have. Right now, I'm stuck using a GTX 2060, only 4GB RAM, a 500GB HDD, and a 650W PSU. It barely holds up for gaming, let alone learning video editing or streaming.

One of my biggest dreams is to start a YouTube channel — something where I can finally share my love for gaming and creativity. But the setup just isn’t there, and financially, upgrading hasn’t been possible for me.

If there’s ever a time you’re helping someone level up their setup, I’d be honored to be considered. Just having someone like you even read this means a lot. Your videos don’t just entertain — they motivate people like me to keep dreaming.

Much love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Keep doing what you do, you’re genuinely making a difference
Just came across this guy for the first time, subscribed after 2 videos. Cutest gaming/YouTube couple, amazing editing that it's like being on the journey in person. Time to binge watch everything this guy has uploaded.
CA$2.00 Like the last vid, I didn't watch it yet, but ik it's gonna be fire Just got through the first minute, Happy birthday Emily!
I just recently started watching you in 2024 watching you strive for the creative artistic way gaming can come in different shapes and sizes. I love that you're bringing the inner childhood of everyone around you out with the amazing designs in gaming rooms you create with you and your teams. I hope for you to never let that fire burn in your heart bro
I just got my first pc today and your the first person to pop up on my YouTube for a pc setup and your channel is awesome definitely going to be subscribing
Santa did a low key version of this for my kiddos this year. You had to be so excited when completed. So rewarding. Keep up the fun sir
New subscriber here from the Philippines! 🇵🇭 Rooting for both of your success. I've been watching your vids for two straight days—love it!
Now this is some fire dedication to your girlfriend.... it's beautiful that you spent so much money just to make her happy..,And it's beautiful that she shows appreciates your by thanking you, it shows how much you both love each other.... Personally, this was a very good vid
You make the coolest gaming setups, every setup looks amazing, cool video
You guys are so loving, happy birthday Emily.
Yes…we are really doing this 18:27
Day 1 of asking Dantic to make me a gaming setup
This is the definition of a proper YouTube video
what an insane gaming setup / room bro!! 

Keep up the insane work!
Amazing video brother. You genuinely cooked with the setup
Crazy how in 4 months you’ve crushed your 500k sub goal?!
Loved helping with this one. I think we did a pretty good job!
08:46 awwwwww
Awmygod, that cable management is power! Let’s go overseas and see if omen will sponsor a road trip to do a amazing setup for a fan. Let’s try to get 3 likes to kickstart this crazy idea
The thought that he would actually go through all this and put up all this money just for a hug from the bottom of his sister's heart, it really brings tears to my eyes, he's just fighting to have the best relationship with his siblings, God bless my friend
Hi Dantic! I was here wen you hit 100k and now i cant believe how fast your channel is growing! I wish you and you fiance the best of luck for the future!
How does this guy always find a way to give him self a way harder challenge in every video .It’s always like a super short deadline or something
i did watch the entire thing.. no lies.. i did watch it when it came out 50 mins ago but then DINNER TIME.. GREAT VIDEO!!!
your like the only youtuber i watch without clickbait thumbnails
MX$20.00 Te quedo super bro🫠
i love it! i recommend working on cable management on future setups as it improves the aesthetics so much!
0:10 ""Its not the best"" Yeah bro its an empty room ️
u r officially my favorite building youtuber
WHY NO CABLE MANAGEMENT????????????????????
You know it’s a good day when Dantic posts.
ARS 100.00 Cuantos likes para salir en tuS videos?
I wish I had someone like her, she's really my dream girl, but Emily seems nice too, congrats to you both
23:27 aww so wholesome

1:47
9:43 I can’t stop watching that part
I know in the future their will be a video on Dantic buying his dream car since if he continue with videos where he has to carry large furniture he will need a better car. Prove me wrong in the future
well done for 1 million
This setup is so insane, what a satisfying video

Hey Dantic,

I know this is a lot to ask, and I don’t even know if you’ll see this, but I just wanted to try... My Ps4 is really old, and I can barely run anything on it. I watch your videos every day, and they always make me smile, even when things are tough. I’ve always dreamed of having a setup like yours, but things at home have been rough, and I can’t afford a new one.

I don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful—I just admire you so much, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you’d see this and understand how much it would mean to me. Even if you can’t help, thank you for everything you do. Your videos make my days a little easier.
Another banger I love the videos
11:50 Why do you have in your phone a Monday??
Petition for Dantic to start a gaming channel.
bro the youtube ai says the topic is no cable management
2:42 Max lével complete! Now is time to build!
Hello from Denmark. Just wanted to drop by and say that me and my son are huge fans. We love your videos, and your gaming setups. Currently trying to make my sons gaming room Cool, but doesnt seem to live up to the ones you make keep up the good work. You inspire us
it said monday on the phone even though you said it was tuesday 11:40
GROW A GARDEN MUSIC 5:47
0:55 TODAY I REPLACE MY FIANCE FOR 6 DAYS
What I find funny is my birthday jabbed itself between their birthdays 
Emily: 23rd
Me: 27th
Dan: 30th
admiro la paciencia que tienen para crear y armar las cosas !

Emily and Adam's Turkish voice-over could have been better. Other than that, the video is great. Nice to meet you, my friend.

It's got power recline onboth seats, power adjustable headrest,hidden speakers that connect to devicesvia Bluetooth, 4D vibration that reactsto the sound playing on the speakers, astorage compartment for things likeblankets and remote controls, USBA and Cports, two wireless charging pads, whichat the touch of a button turn into cupholders, and hidden inside the armrest,there's two hidden shelf compartmentswhich are perfect for storing thingslike crisp and other snacks in.

I'm Jourdan, a silly goose who loves playing video games, exploring fantasy worlds, and hanging out with my cat, Riku. \n\nI also like mean blondes🌻","[Music]Hello and welcome to my gaming roomtour. My name is Jordan. If we haven'tmet before, hi. Hello. Nice to meet you.And if you do know who I am, you likelyrecognize the shelves behind me as Ifeature them in like all my content.I'll get questions about my gaming roomsetup, about my PC specs, and so Ithought it would just be fun to give youa full tour of my gaming setup. I willshow you how I maximize my space in hereand all the fun little trinkets that Ihave gathered over the years. I am quitethe maximalist if you can't tell. Allright, without further ado, let's get onwith the tour. Come along. Come along.Let's do this.Let's start our tour at the mostimportant part of any gaming room, thedesk. I use this Dell 34in widescreenmonitor that wasn't really meant forgaming, but I got it at a great price.I'm kind of a Logitech girl. I've gotthe MXM 3 mouse. I've got this lovelycreamy keyboard and the G735 headset.I've also been using this Logitech Bluemic for the past couple of years, and Ilove it. I think it's amazing. And Irecently just got a mic stand for itthat has really upped my audio. I tendto use a controller for a lot of mygaming. And Trolley sent me this reallyfunny controller stand that I've beenusing recently. I've got my KingdomHearts coaster and a bunch of littletrinkets that I keep on my desk likepens and hair clips by Mommy Dy. I lovethese. So, on to my PC build. I have anNZXT case. I needed it in white becausethat's my aesthetic. And I put all thesegoofy stickers on it from cons anddifferent things. I just love my littlestickers. This bad boy runs on an NvidiaRTX 4070 12 GB GPU and AMD Ryzen 7 5800CPU. We got the Corsair Liquid coolerand fans and the Corsair Vengeance Pro32 GB for memory. And it has a MSI B550Tomahawk motherboard. I also have awonderful Herman Miller Aaron chair thatmy dad stole from his office for me. Itliterally saves my back posture whileI'm gaming. Speaking of gaming, there isone game that I've been playing non-stoplately that I need to talk about. Ifinally started playing DisneyDreamlight Valley, and I've alreadyspent so many hours decorating myperfect little valley. There's trulynothing more nostalgic than building adream village alongside the Disney andPixar characters that I grew up with.You can farm, fish, decorate, go onquests for your favorite characters, andthere's even online multiplayer so youcan show off your valley to yourfriends. I love dressing up my littlecharacter. Look how dang cute he is. anddecorating my home and tending to mylittle garden. This is literally theepitome of cozy. This also felt like theperfect time to start playing sinceDisney Dream My Valley just released anew update with a new character andquests and they're dropping more contentevery few months. It's really theperfect game to jump in for a quick cozyreset or spend an entire afternoon within the most magical way. Thank you toDisney Dreamlight Valley for sponsoringthis video. I love your game. You canplay Disney Dreamlight Valley yourselfon PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and NintendoSwitch and get started on your valleytoday.Let me take you on a tour of my iconicshelves. They're my pride and joy, andI've just loved all the little thingsthat I've filled them with over the past2 years.The star of the show is my beautifulplant.Her name is Bulma. I think she'sbeautiful. I got her at a local plantstore here. And I don't know how I'vekept her alive all this time. I don'tknow. This is just kind of the the Lordof the Rings shelf. We have my beautifulpopcorn bucket. We also have KingTheodin's sword. I'm obsessed with thisthing, but I need to get a displayholder for the wall so I can like put upthere. How do you guys think that wouldbe nice? And then I'm sure all of youhave noticed this amazing Lego set. It'sthe Lord of the Rings ribbon bell that Ithink is just the most beautiful part ofthis entire room. This is a SailorMoonlight that I got on Amazon like twoand a half years ago. So hopefully thelisting is still up if you like it.These are Stein from Germany. Actuallyfrom Germany. And because this is abookshelf, I we I did put books on it.Um, so here are just some fun picturebooks and adventure books, differentlittle things I've either thrifted orbought over the years. And this is mydedicated Stardew Valley corner. I get alot of Stardew Valley things fromfriends as gifts and brands. So, we'vegot our little petty candle. And thisthis is a diarama made for me by GamerNostalgia. That's literally my characterthere. I love it so much.Got the cookbook, the guide book. I havea Stardew uh controller as well. Just mylittle my little shrine to one of myfave games. We've got a little trinketcorner under here with my prizedautograph from Deborah Wild from BaldersDay 3. So cute. And a picture of ShadowHeart um behind it that I need to getframed or put on a wall somewhere. Herewe have a speaker that I don't useenough and probably should, but it islike 10 or 15 years old, so you know,it's probably not as good as it could beanymore. And we got the Junimos from FanGamer. And then two absolute baddy iconsfrom animes. We've got Trunks and Toga.They're the baddies.Another book for the bookshelf. Somemore trinkets and books and things fromtravels and adventures. Then we haveeven more Legos. Legos are the best.More plushies, some of my faves, morebooks, and then a few more books just toround it all out. He's beautiful. Trulya masterpiece that I am so proud of. Ilove this bookshelf. It's so maximalist,but I that is my vibe for sure. And thenwe have the mini bookshelf that matchesthe big bookshelf um with just some morehellowith some more of the books I've beenreading recently and some vinyls. Andthen these are some cubbies that are somonstrously packed with all of mycosplay and sewing stuff. It is it's Iwill not be looking inside there. And wehave Riku.If you've seen my short form videos,you'll know that I I do this view a lotfor my filming. I'll set up my phonelike here and I'll do my acting.It's cuz it's straight onto the windows,so I get the best lighting, the naturallighting. You also get a lot of shotsfrom this angle, too, for the samereason. We'd love some good lighting andthe beautiful shelves in the background.Oh, and I can't forget to show thesecond full desk setup that I have inhere. This one's got a fun dark theme tocontrast the light of my setup. And it'salso rocking a Logitech mouse andkeyboard, plus an ROG monitor, and itdoes not have its own PC yet, but thatis on the wish list. Some final littledetails of the room. There are a bunchof swords everywhere. Um, a lot of mytrinkets kind of lying around. We've gotRiku's little bed, and probably some ofthe worst cable management you've everseen. Here's also a peek at what thesetups look like at night. I love theglow. I've been adding a lot of the RGBlighting in here recently and I justfeel like a real gamer when I'm in here.Plus, there's no overhead light, so Ikind of need these to see anything inthe dark. So, put all of that togetherand this is what you get. It is not thebiggest room, but it is what you do withthe space you have that counts. Andhonestly, this is like the coziest spacein the whole apartment, which isn't thatmuch bigger. And that is the end of ourtour. I hope you enjoyed this because Ireally did. Let me know what kind ofcontent you want to see from me next. Iappreciate you guys so much and hope tosee you in the next one. Subscribe ifyou want to. I love you. Goodbye.[Music]","You can join me in Disney Dreamlight Valley here: https://gmlft.co/DDV_JourdanGames_YouTube
Wow love all the Lego cars!! and Rivendell! ️
A game room is goals and this one is done well. Love the neon signs.
5:32 my dad actually has that exact same giant speaker, neither of us care that it isnt the highest quality audio, because he got it second hand, but it just looks so cool and that was enough of a reason for him to get it
dripped out white pc gang! love the setup dude
Well this was super fun! This channel is such great vibes.
Your smile is amazing, always makes me feel better
Oh I love this! 🩷🩷🩷 Nerd Room Tours are the best, just a collection of all that person’s most loved stories. That Devora Wilde autograph is awesome!
7:58 I want this neon lights
Love the cable management lol. Also the Gaymer sticker! Cute room :)
Finally got Stardew Valley (love it!)... I was super surprised to find I already played a game just like it last year called Palia. It's basically the same premise except abit more expanded on and all 3D and modern glow up graphics.. It doesn't quite hit the charm of old school sprites, but it is an MMO so that's cool. You should check it out!
This room gives off Xerneas .
Bless sweet fluffy Riku!
That sit up is so clean! Thank you for sharing, you have an amazing space that experiences yourself! Cozy space for sure!
Nice Kame island wallpaper on the monitor.
Legos truly are the best. You need more on display
Side lighting is the best.. overhead lighting is pure anxiety imo lol. Also those shelves are nice!
Happy Thursday Jourdan, I always enjoy your Stardew videos!!! Disney Dreamlight is one of my favorite games currently. I have 300 hours in the game, and my favorite charecters are Wall-E, Anna, Elsa, Remy and Mickey!!!
Sims, Stardew, Dreamlight and Fields of Mistria are the cozy games I enjoy! Great setup!!
I love your gaming room
El gato es lo mejor
looks cool
This is a dream room
Thats such a clean setup! Love the lego cars especially the little porsche 911 at the bottom
Thats a pretty cool mouse, I have a bunch of stickers on my pc too lmao
Ahhh I loved seeing everything in the room! Love your setup so much
You should play this game called vintage story it’s really good it’s like Minecraft but you can put a lot of more details and more realistic
I...I don't know how I got here, but I don't think I want to leave. I am just very confused?
Okay Jourdan
I've always loved your set up and style! So cute!
Loving the setup. Gonna have to take some inspiration from it for revamping mine.
Such a beautiful and fun set up ! I love how you arranged your bookcase (Hello Trunk from the future ! One of my childhood's crushes ) It's so cute how Riku (please correct my spelling if it's wrong) was staying in your arms, with his little paws on your arm, being rocked around. And congrats for the sponsorship !
Hello Riku!!
Nice room! Do you have a link to the display at 6:29?
Do you happen to know where you got your desk desk? I am using two tables put together, and it's miserable, lol. Your desk looks super spacious and nice! Also adorable kitty bed. I'm trying to find one for my cat Jester, and I might need to look into that one, haha. 

Cute video!
I'm lit sitting in that same chair in the smoke shack...
happy pride month ms jourdan!! love the setup :))
I like a nice and clean setup! I guess it's also your workspace, but man!... where do you keep all your mail and papers and stuff? XD That's what clutters my space.

6:48 So you have chosen death.
Noice!!!!
I've got a desk, a computer... Yep that's about it :P

For real though that looks sick! :)
That must be an expensive apartment
cute
Everyone I know get their Herman Miller chairs by unconventional means
Nice! A little bit too bright for my taste, but as a streamer, you need the ""gud lite""!
What mic stand is this? I have the same and can't get the one I have to keep it in place. And if you like to get a similar plant, there is the Blue-star Fern (Phlebodium aureum), but I personally prefer the Kangaroo Paw Fern (zealandia pustulata).

For anyone interested, I have a chair from the same brand. Wait for a sale or get them refurbished. Better for your back then any gaming chair. Don't forget to move at least 30min a day and do basic back training. No back bain.
There must be technical issue here, I cannot find the OF link. Pls help !
You must be rich
I shudder to think what that apartment must cost.
What city is that?
It is really my dreaming corner! By the way, we have a game collaboration opportunity and sent email to you~
The Lego set is almost $700...
this comment refers to 1:37 in video. you must be very bussy person because of your nails ^^ Very nice setup :)
BBNO$ !??!
Yo like how gorgeous are you

Iwasn't completely happy with the waythat it turned out. So, today I'm goingto correct my mistake, and I'm going tobuild my actual dream room and dreamgaming setup. All right, first thingsfirst. I went to Walmart and bought adresser. We got Brian here. He's goingto put it together, and I'm going torecord. Wait, what? It says easyassembly. So, we should be able to getit put together in about 5 minutes tops.But I bought a dresser to really get ridof that black cube shelf that Briankeeps walking in front of. And it'sgoing to eliminate this ugly thing outof my closet. You ready to put ittogether? Mhm. All right. Let's juststart off by saying this thing was noteasy to put together. Even though theinstructions said easy assembly. Well,maybe it would have been easier if itwasn't two idiots putting it together,but it probably took us a solid 2 hoursto put this thing together. There yougo. Now that I got that built, which Igot to say, it looks a lot better. Mynext problem lies with this wall rightabove my gaming setup. It is just soblank. It makes my setup look boring. Itjust I need to put something rightthere. Another thing from Walmart. Ibought these two little shelves and I'mgoing to put them like I'm going to putone here and then one a little bithigher on this side. And I'm not excitedto hang these because they're floatingshelves and they're Walmart shelves. Sothey they're going to be a nightmare tohang. First shelf is up. That only tookme about 15 minutes. Let's get thesecond one up. Even that right therejust adds so much. But of course, I willbe decorating them. I'm just waiting onsome Amazon packages. And here are theAmazon packages. So, these aren'tactually from Amazon. One of my coworkergave me these. She had them sitting inher house. And then I got some cheap uhLED lights for the back of my dresser.And then we're going to open this Amazonpackage cuz I got some cool stuff inhere, too. So, the first thing we got ismy brand new mouse pad. I am so excitedfor this. I had one very similar to it.Look at that. It's going to match allthe white furniture I have in here.These are my brand new hanging plants.Oh my gosh. I didn't think they werethat long. And there's three of them inhere. And then we got a second one andthe third one. Yeah. Let's get thisstuff put up.Dude, I did not realize how long thatone was, but I think it looks sogood. And the last thing I got, it's alittle bit big, but it's this uh bigtree thing. Yeah, I got this little fakebamboo. Well, my grandmother gave it tome cuz I've been looking for them andthey're so expensive and she found thisat a yard sale for like $3. So, I'mgoing to put this right here. My newdresser. I just got to put the LEDlights on the back of the dresser. So,I'm going to go ahead and pull that outand that's what I'm going to do now.This thing is so freaking[Music]heavy. I got them plugged in andworking. This is what it looks like now.Here, let me slide this plant back overhere. Look at that, dude. That looks sogood. So, other than the new mouse pad,my setup is going to remain pretty muchthe same. And because of that, I'm justgoing to go over the peripherals for thepeople who have not watched my channelbefore. I have the Blue Yeti mic on afine fine boom arm. I have the RazerHuntsmanMini. I have the Logitech Pro Superite2, the best mouse I've ever used.Obviously, the brand new mouse pad. Ihave an Acer 27 in curved 240 Hz displaymonitor. I just have a regular basic 165Hz monitor as my vertical display. Andthen a Logitech I want to say C922 if Iremember correctly. I might be wrongabout that. And just a basic light thatI got off of Amazon. And if you guyswant to know more about the PC, I havean entire video of it on my channel.This thing is a beast. Yeah, that's mysetup. Now I think that it's time forthe final cinematic of this video.","You have inspired me to make content for my channel

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!

Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
This video deserves a million views.

Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!

And it might justbe the best budget setup I've everbuilt. Getting started, as you guys cansee, we have so many items right herefor this setup. And it's literally only$700, like I said, and it's amazing. So,yeah, I'm actually just going to go overthe peripherals first. Um, right hereactually is the Nubo Gio6 headset. I'veactually done like a short video onthis, and this headset is actuallyreally good. It's literally less than$30. It's like wireless or you can dowired and it just has a bunch of optionsthat are really, really good for theprice. But yeah, taking it out of thebox, as you guys can see, we got all ofthis stuff for the headset right there.It also comes wrapped in two differentthings. And then right here, we canactually get the headset out and you canjust see for yourselves. Like it justlooks really good, but you can't reallyexpect that much. And it's supercomfortable. Like literally, it alsolooks pretty good, I think. And for aheadset, it's definitely not bad by anymeans. And then next up, we actually gota white mouse as well. And right here isthe Razer Essential Mouse from Amazon.It's literally I think less than $20,but it's a super super clean mouse asyou guys can see. Honestly, I have usedit before actually, but it is reallygood and it's only 20 bucks. And forthis setup that we're building, guys,right around $700. Like, I'm telling youguys, everything in here you're going toenjoy a lot if you choose to get ityourself. And then next up, we're goingto go with the keyboard. And this isalso a white theme. And as you guys cansee, we have a lot of white peripheralsright here. Um, that is on purpose. Thesetup is going to look really good, likeI said. But yeah, this is the TK68SEon Amazon. Literally right around $20.And when I tell you guys you can'treally spend $20 anywhere else for akeyboard besides right here, I mean it.Like literally, this has red switches.You guys can hear it. It also comes withthis detachable cable along with akeycap puller that clearly works as youguys can see. And then you can also justtake a look at the red switches rightthere. I was cleaning up some old filesthe other day and I accidentally deleteda folder with all of my old videos init. And I thought that I was deletingjust temporary files and stuff, but itwas actual footage that I needed. Andyeah, it was completely gone. Like noteven in the recycle bin or in any backupfiles. It was literally gone. So I endedup using this software calledWondershare Recover It. And somehow itbrought everything back. It was theoriginal full quality file. There waslike no corruption or weird glitches. Itwas like they were never even deleted inthe first place. I honestly don't knowhow the software recovered the files,but I'm so glad it did. It works withover 1,000 different file types,including videos, photos, and projectfiles, and can even recover fromexternal drives, SD cards, or even crashsystems. It's super easy to use, and itactually shows you a little previewbefore you recover anything, which isvery nice. But yeah, if you've everdeleted files by accident or lostanything due to crashing, recover itmight actually save you. I'm going toleave a link in the description if youguys are interested in getting it, butit definitely helped me. But yeah, Imean, it's really solid. Like usually,like I remember years ago, mechanicalkeyboards used to cost a lot more.Literally only cost 20 bucks if not alittle less than that. And next up, weactually have a mic. So, we do actuallyhave a mic in this setup. It wouldn'treally be a complete gaming setup. Imean, I know the uh headset does have amic on it, and it actually is prettydecent, but you know, having a dedicatedmic is always great. And, you know, yourvoice sounds crisp and clear. Like, eventhough we don't necessarily need onebecause this headset does literally havea mic on it and it works pretty decent.Um, you know, it's in the budget. It'swithin 700 bucks, so why not get it? Imean, you guys can spend this anywhereelse if you want to, like for a monitorarm or something, but I'm going to showyou guys this mic. This is the FifineAM8 microphone. Very, very good quality.I'm not going to lie. Put on the bassjust like that. And the whole thing doeslight up as you guys will see a littlebit later on. But yeah, this is the micright here. Like I said, it's a verygood budget microphone. Literally, Idon't know what else you could getbetter for around that price. Yeah, italso does come with a detachable cablejust like the uh keyboard did and theheadset actually. So, the only thingwithout a detachable cable here isliterally the mouse, which is prettyfunny. Yeah. Now, finally, we can get onto the more interesting part of this uhsetup right here, which is the monitor.And this is a Titan Army 144 hertzgaming monitor. It is 24 1/2 in. So,definitely a pretty decent size.Although, you can probably find onethat's 27 in. This one is under $100.So, I mean, for the budget, this is likea really good monitor. And we're goingto be able to see 144 FPS on this thing.So definitely not bad at all, especiallywith the computer we're getting, whichI'll actually go over right now. And Iam going to have to unbox it cuz it isbrand new in the box. As you guys cansee, it is always hard to get thesethings out of the box sitting down. SoI'm going to have to make you guys widerand take it out this way. But yeah,before I take it out, it is fromBlackout Computers. It is the Eclipsegaming PC. So we'll take this out. Firstthing that you guys see in the boxthough is just a couple of things. Thisis like a troubleshoot guide right here.This right here is some otheraccessories, I'm pretty sure. And thenwe have the PC. It is literally alwaysso difficult with one arm. Well, if thecomputer doesn't perform very good inthis video, I think I know why. But mybad, guys. But I was going to say thatI'm just going to put it upside down soit can actually come out pretty easy.So, there we go. Get that box out ofhere. It does have a lot of packagingaround it, so it's definitely not goingto be damaged or anything like that.Dude, I am dropping everything rightnow. There we go. We finally get thelast piece of packaging open. Andactually not the last piece ofpackaging, but you guys can see theaesthetic of this computer actuallylooks really good. The funny thing iswith all these white peripherals, we dohave a black PC, but it's funny cuz theydo actually have a white version of thisPC as well. And I'm pretty sure it'slike the same price, but I didn't wantto get everything white, you know. Uh wealso do have a black mic, so it kind ofhelps it. But yeah, this is the PC. I'lltake the packaging out and show you guysthe RGB.Dude, this song is stuck in my head,guys. Hold on. I have to play it for asecond. Hopefully I don't getcopyrighted. I'll play it for like 1second. I'm going to play like literallylike one second of it cuz I don't want achance to get copyrighted. Butthat song right there, you guys knowwhat I'm talking about. Anyways, back tothe PC. It's actually not even like asong. It's like a remix that someonemade in like whatever software they callit on PC that they make music and beats,whatever. This is the packaging righthere. Go ahead and take this out. Andguys, if I if there was like a recordfor how much packaging you can have in aPC for it not to get damaged, I swearit's literally this PC right here. Butyeah, looks very good. Hold on. Let meplug it in. All right, it's all pluggedin right now. So, we can actually powerit on hopefully. Power supply. My myfault. Rookie mistake. All right, so nowit's actually plugged in. We can turn iton. And yeah, you guys can see the RGBon it definitely looks uh like prettygood. Again, it's literally only $500.And this PC's actually been on sale alot. So, like for $450 and stuff. Um,all black as you guys can see. Even theGPU, like if we zoom in, even the GPUhas this like back plate on it thatmakes it look really good. And the wholething just all blacked out. Sodefinitely really good aesthetically.Yeah, obviously aesthetics aren'teverything in a computer and youdefinitely want the specs to be prettydecent for what you're paying for. Sothis PC right here actually does have anRX 580 GPU. Um, very decent, especiallyfor 1080p gaming and for a pre-builtcomputer under $500. It also has twosticks of 16 GB of RAM as well as a 1TBTE SSD and an i74790CPU. And instantly you guys are probablylike, ""That's a really old CPU."" Buthonestly, this CPU handles gaming prettywell, especially like low settings 1080pgames. Definitely pretty well still in2025. Um, and you can't literally gosearch for yourself on Amazon right nowand try to find one that's much betterthan this for $500. Like, you literallycan't for pre-built gaming PCs. And youguys will see later on in this video,like you still get well over 100 FPS andthere's not really many issues at all. Ido want to go over these right here.These have been here the whole time andI forgot to go over them, but these aremy own mouse pads which we will be usingfor the setup. They are only 25 bucksand they just make the entire setup. Anysetup you have looks so much better. Um,but yeah, only $25. They're my owncustom mouse pads. I have a ton ofdesigns like this black one, this darkblue swirl one, this light blue swirlone, this white swirl one, and a bunchof other designs. Um, I'm not sureexactly which one to use for this setup.Maybe the white one. I don't know. Yeah.Also, if you guys do want one of thesemouse pads and you don't want one of thedesigns that are already out, you cancustomize your own literally bycustomizing, meaning I can makeliterally anything you can think aboutand put it on a mouse pad for you foryou to buy at no extra charge at all.So, it'll still be $25 if you just joinmy Discord and DM me actually willing tobuy it. So, yeah, definitely very good.They're very big and comfortable as youguys can see. But, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonnastop talking about everything and justgo ahead and get right into the gamingpart of this video and show you guys theentire setup all set up.All right, guys. We got everything setup right here. I also just want toquickly show you guys the microphonequality. So, I'll go over to switch toit right now. And as you guys can hear,it's a pretty good mic. Like I'm saying,the Fifine AM8 microphone. Definitelynot a bad choice at all if you'relooking to get into it. And thenobviously you have a bunch of uhlighting effects right here as you guyscan see while you're rotating throughthem. So yeah, it's a definitely apretty decent mic. Yeah, we're going togo ahead and get right into this game.The first game we're going to be playingis War Zone. I think we're going to beable to get pretty decent FPS. I'mhoping over 60, but there's only one wayto find out. So, let's go ahead and loadin. Right off the start loading in,we're literally getting 80 FPS. This isso good, dude. 60 FPS. Over 60 ishonestly insane. Like, anything over 60is great. There's like there's nostutters either. So, this is like apretty solid 60 fps. Not a stuttery 60fps, if that makes any sense. Oh my,dude. He scared me so bad because I wasjust about to say something. My mind wasnot in the game at all. I haveheadphones that are studio headphonesliterally cost like over $150. The DT990Pros. So, I know what good headphonesare and these are good like and I alsoknow what bad headphones are. Like Ihave like some Senzor SG500 cheap budgetheadsets and this is a really budgetheadset and it's also wireless and it'sreally good sound quality.[Music]Take him out. Oh my god, he just gotfaked out so bad. He just got faked outso bad, guys. Y'all saw that. Y'all sawthat IQ. I know y'all did. Let's go.Another person.He want the smoke as well, man. Hey,come and get it. Come and get it. Oneafter the other. Clearly, you guys cansee I'm having no issues playing thisgame at all. I don't even play War Zone,but I do know that I am able to, sothat's really what matters. Oh, out ofthe sky. Oh, you're lucky.[Music]Oh, I thought I was going to respond, soI didn't even say anything. I wasn'teven going to show that in the video.But hey, we got enough gameplay, Iguess. But yeah, anyway, we're going togo and get to the next game. I'm prettysure this PC can run a lot of games, sowe're going to find out. All right,guys. We just loaded into Valerant rightnow. I don't even know how much FPSwe're going to get. Over well, we'reaveraging 200 FPS in Valerant. That isamazing.Able to bop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.Dang it. Yeah, that's why we don't pullout our knives. Okay, guys. That's whywe don't pull out our knives. But thisis just a warm-up anyway. But over 200,like around 200 FPS is very good on likemy gameplay. Hold on. Let me redeemmyself. Let me redeem myself. Let meredeem myself. Come on. Let me redeemmyself.Okay. Kind of. There we go. That's alittle better. We're getting We'regaining on it. We're gaining on it alittle bit.We're gaining on it a little bit.[Music]But yeah, I mean, this is great. Likethis is PC is a pre-built PC. If youdon't want to build one or get a usedone, this pre-built computer, look atour FPS right now. 230. Like, not bad,man. Not bad at all. Wait, my Oh, comeon. Wow. I almost just had a lisp thereand I don't even have a lisp. There wego. Both them. Should I just talk like Ihave a list for the rest of the video?Come on, man.I guess not, guys.Bop,[Music]two, one.I'm all Forn. Oh, wait. I'm all Forn.Yeah, we're going into a different gamenow. Um, Fortnite. Why not Fortnite?Let's see how that runs. Uh, I have highhopes. It is an all black creative mapas you guys can see. Um, we are gettingLooks like the peak FPS we got was 280FPS in creative. I wonder like is thatchanges the more we go out or something?I don't know. Yeah, 280. I saw 280 max.Not bad at all. There's also literallyno input delay on this keyboard at all.Like I'm telling you guys, I can buildand I feel no input delay. This keyboardis really solid and it also feels reallygood. Those other games I wasn't likeable to use it super fast cuz they'renot, you know, super fast-paced games.But everything right now is amazing.Definitely worth the $700 in my opinion.literally everything I'm using.Literally no issues whatsoever. Likeyeah, I'm g just go ahead and take thisinto a game. We're averaging 200 FPSwhile building and stuff in creative,which is insane. So, let's see if we canget hopefully we can average around 120to 144 in game, especially with the 144hertz monitor. But yeah. All right,guys. I can't even stress this enough.We're getting 150 while we are literallygliding down. Like, that's amazing.There's people all over us, though,which I do not like. He's literallycamping somewhere. But look at the FPS,guys. Just take a moment to look atthat. That is so good. I need to getout. I don't have mats. Sorry. Oh mygosh. What an escape.I do not have mats to fight anybodyright now, unfortunately.Okay, spray and pray. Spray and prayworks sometimes, and that was sometimes.So, let's go. Oh my gosh, he's low. AndI'm getting third party. That is notgood. That is not good.[Applause][Music]6464 Okay, nice. No way. No way, brother.No way. I'm getting shot at someone. Ihave nowhere to land now, guys. Thismight be wraps. This is probably wraps.I don't know why the whole lobby istargeting me right now. I have nothing.Isbox them.Oh my goodness. That was such a goodkill, dude. Dude. Oh my goodness. He hada spaz as well. If he just hit me, wewere dead. What am I doing? Oh my gosh.I did not mean to do that.If he literally just hit me, we weredead there. What a kill.Oh my gosh. There's no way. There'sabsolutely zero way possible that justhappened. Oh my goodness. We are likethat. I'm telling you, that purple spatsaved me. I hit him for like 190.I don't know what to tell you guys, butthis PC seems to be fine. Didn't shoot.We're dead. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Wecouldn't win. My shotgun just didn'tshoot when I looked at him, cuz we wouldhave killed him there. I'm not going tolie. But yeah, this PC is very good. umover 144 fps consistently ishonestly that that exceeded myexpectations for this PC, but clearly itcan run some games. I'm going to do afew games super quickly just to show youguys how they run. But Fortnite,definitely check that one off the listas well. All right, guys. Rocket League,I'll show you guys the settings in asecond, but it's definitely runnable aswell. Like, it's not surprising thatit's runnable. Literally, all the othergames were. And this game does not taketoo much at all. So you guys can seethat uh if we go to here, this is mysettings. And honestly, like on anysingle PC, this is still the settingsI'm going to use in Rocket League, justcuz I don't like playing in highsettings on a game like this, just cuz,you know, the competitive advantage islow settings. Um, even in Rocket League,but I will show you guys what highsettings does look like and how itperforms. All right, so I'm going applythese settings right here. You guys cantake a look at them if you know RocketLeague. I guess they already appliedthat quick. Wow. Okay. I wasn'texpecting the PC to be that fast, butwe're still getting like the same FPS.Wow, that's actually kind of crazy.We're getting still 160 in RocketLeague. No issues at all. Definitelylooks good for the enjoyment of thegame. Not for competitive reasons,though. That's just how I've alwaysbeen. But yeah, we're going to go intothe next game. I'm going to show youguys Minecraft and how much FPSMinecraft can get. But all of thesegames are runnable. Like it seems ifthey're not AAA games, you're going tobe able to run them perfectly fine. Andeven some AAA games you can probablyrun. All right, I'm making a new worldright now. We see how fast it loads up.That's loaded in. We are getting over400 FPS. Wow. I mean, that is notsurprising, honestly. Almost 500. So,you can definitely run this game withsome high quality shaders. I'll show youguys my settings right now. This isthem. All right. Now, my thing. I alwayswant to test out maximum FPS. So, let'sgo. Whoa. Hold on. If we just look righthere.All right. 1,00 FPS. All right. Thatthat Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.Blackout PC. I was looking for somehorse armor or something, but look, morediamonds right here. More diamonds righthere. Wow,what a cave. What a cave. I think wejust sell more diamonds as well, maybe.All right, at the bottom of the worldright now. I really just want to see howmuch FPS we get looking down at it. Allright, so Minecraft FPS on this computermaximum 1343. I saw 1473. 1473 is thehighest FPS we can get in Minecraft. Idon't know why. I just wanted to dothat. But that's insane. I really don'thave any other games to really test foryou guys cuz most of you guys haveprobably played one of those gamesbefore and you know how good thecomputer is basing it off of that. Butyeah, I'm going go and go to the outroand tell you guys my final thoughts. Allright, so $700 and we're getting thisright here. Yeah, I'm not going to lie,that's a very good deal. Literally theonly thing you can do better is the PCby building one or buying one used. Butyou guys saw the performance. Like it'snot bad at all for a pre-built.Instantly people assume when you heari74790 it's so old 10 years old. Butyeah, but like how much FPS we werestill getting though. For me it reallywasn't an issue at all to have some goodgameplay and you know entertain you guyswith it. Yeah. I mean taking a look foryourselves like you guys can just seethe aesthetics is also really good on itas well. It's not like it's just somecheap put together PC. It has a blackback plate on it as well. Two sticks of8 GB of RAM and yeah just overall verygood. Not to mention the greatmicrophone, amazing headset, keyboard,mouse, monitor, mouse pad especially.It's just simply that good in myopinion.All this stuff will be linked down belowin the description. And also, if you'vedeleted any of your old videos oranything that you want, make sure tocheck out recover it uh in thedescription. The link will be there.Definitely a very useful software. Butyeah, this right here is the uh verse ofthe day. You guys can read that righthere. Um, yeah, remember that Jesus doeswant a relationship with you guys. So,just make sure to look into that. And,uh, yeah, also check out the videos hereand here if you're interested. Um, verygood videos. And I'll see you guys nextone.

Bro is showcasing 580 prebuilts
Can you do a bunch of a gaming set up? 1500
Been here since 1K great to see you evolve to 30K
Hello Fluxphy, My name is Mohab, and I’m a 13-year-old boy from Canada. I’ve been a huge fan of Fortnite for years, but I’ve never had the chance to play on a real gaming PC. Right now, I play on a school Chromebook that I had to borrow, using GeForce Now Experience just to get into matches. It’s super laggy, and the delay makes it really hard to improve or even enjoy the game the way I want to. But I keep playing anyway because I love it so much.

I’ve entered tons of PC giveaways from different content creators, hoping for a chance, but I’ve never won any of them. I know there are so many people out there asking too, and I don’t want to seem like I’m begging—but for someone like me, who comes from a family that can’t really afford something like a gaming setup, it would honestly mean the world.

Gaming is more than just fun to me—it’s where I feel the most confident, and it helps me escape when things get tough. You’ve already helped so many people, and even if nothing happens, just being able to message you gives me a little hope. Thank you so much for always being generous and inspiring so many kids like me to keep dreaming.
you improve day by day, underrated af
if you want more fps with an RX 580 you need a Ryxen 5 5400 or 5 5600
I can get the pc?
for 400 dollars that isnt a bad pc 80 fps on MW3?
Can you do a 900 bucks setup with a self built pc
I would get this computer, I'm not a pc gamer but it's good enough for my photography. One problem though, it uses windows 10 and I'm pretty sure it can't be upgraded to Windows 11. It's a shame because the price it good as well.
bro try gaming with 2 gigs of ram and an intel PENTIUM cpu i get 10 fps on solitaire bro i bet you the nokia 3310 can run more games than chungus(the name of my laptop from 2008 and it broke been rockin that thing for like 6 years bro i rlly to save it)

So, today we have a veryexciting project. If you saw one of myvideos that I did maybe nearly a yearago, I did a manga room makeoverorganization video. And I did thatbecause Flexispot had sent me a reallynice new desk. So, then I reorganized mywhole room. Pretty much rearranged it.And yeah, that turned out really, reallynice. But today, instead of doing myroom, we are going to be reorganizingand rearranging my husband's room. So,he has a I guess like a manga room aswell. Well, it's more like a hobbyrooms. He has like manga anime stuff andalso his gaming stuff. And so, I thinkyou might have seen it if you saw hismanga collection video that I did. Ithink that was over a year ago now aswell. So, I haven't shown you his roomsince, but we have an exciting projectbecause we're going to be rearranginghis room because Flexisport actuallysent me another desk to try out, whichis the E7 Pro. The one that I have in myroom is the E7, not the Pro version. So,they kindly sent me the Pro version totry out. So, we're going to put that inhis room and rearrange his whole room.So, first off, I'm going to show youwhat we're working with. He has notgiven the his room uh a lot of love inmy opinion, especially he's been morefocused on rearranging my room andgiving my room a lot of love. So, we'regoing to do that for him today. And Ihave got permission from him to show youthe state of his room at the moment. So,it's not me trying to shame him oranything. I got his permission and he'sreally, really happy and excited to gothrough this transformation. So, yeah,let's go see what his room looks likenow. Hello. Can I come in? Ooh. Okay. Imean, it's not thatbad. Okay. Let me pass over the mic.What do you got to say? Welcome to mycave. A very unorganized cave. You'vegot loads of like tools here and randomstuff that we've just like put into yourroom. And then you have all your yourfigures and stuff. And then your desk,which this one actually is. It's the 160* 80, right? And this one we bought inIKEA. And then we're going to bereplacing it with a 180 * 160. So, wegot the flexi spot here. Let me let himgive the tour of his room. Hello guys.So, as you can see, I've not given myroom a lot of love, but let's start withthe book shelf. So, the manga shelf. Asyou can see, I initially intended tohave like figures that corresponds tothe series. Very obviously there'sjiu-jitsu kaizen. There's jiu-jitsukaising figures here. And then obviouslyeventually I can probably have kaijuhere and kaiju and all that stuff. Butit's all splattered now. They're allfalling down. They're all fallingasleep, knocked out. There's like randomcrap, you know, like stuff like this.There's super glue there. Like it's it'sit's a mess. It's a hot mess. But it's ashame because you know these books lookreally good like on the shelf especiallythe full full metal alchemist and thatwas probably like one of the best ones.But as you can see and probably from theprevious videos you probably can see Igot these like chunky ones now. So Ineed to consider these now. But yeahthat's basically the shelf. I do want togive it a lot of love which hopefully Ican do today. Next is obviously thisthing. You probably saw in Lydia'soriginal video. She did have thisbefore. I actually can't remember whatyou put on there. Just books. Justbooks. But as you can see, it's it'sit's almost like a dumping ground.Unfortunately, I did want to use this askind of like a storage thing, but then Iwas like kind of conflicted because Ilike the spacing of it. It could be goodfor like box sets and you know all thatstuff. So, as you can see, the top halfis that and the second half is likestorage. And then yeah, see we got theshelf. Super long shelf. I actuallycan't remember how long it is. I assumeis about 180 which is the same length ofmy new table and hopefully it wouldshould cleanly align but we'll see. Andyes, and finally kind of like my desk.So this is the 160 by 80 desk by IKEA.Not going to lie, I've had this for like3 years now. It has treated me well.However, the only ick I have about thisis I if I move the table a little bitlike up and down, it moves a lot. AndLydia, if you like pay attention to thatfigure so which is moreobvious, it moves a lot. So, I I'm agamer, so if I play like very activegames like Apex, I guess it's going tomove a lot. And hopefully the FlexisSpot will fix it. I'm sure it will.We'll test it out. Yeah, for sure. We'lldefinitely test it out. But yeah, I loveI love this desk. Size is great. AndSuki loves it, too. And then moving on,obviously, you know, this is kind oflike a display area. I'm not sure. I'mkind of satisfied with it in terms ofthe quantity. It just needs to beneatened up. Obviously, there's mykeyboards. They were like mini projectsand stuff. And then, you know, my kindof like top tier, I guess, like favoriteart books and comics. The Bornless oneis actually part of a project I'm from.So, I'm actually credited in the comics.So, that's kind of cool. And this isbasically another handme-down fromLyoon. Not going to lie, I did not knowwhat I wanted to do because it was sosudden. And again it's it it has becomea half display half dumping ground whichis really unfortunate because this doesgive a lot of storage I guess you cansay or like display you know there'slike random crap like electronics wiringand all that stuff. So yeah and thenobviously lastly this is kind of like myclothing and t-shirts that are likelimited shout outs goes to Michelle youknow stuff that I really want to kind oflike really look after and got a dumpingground and that's my room for now. Allright. So, I think the plan here is whatyou want to do, right, is move this.We're going to empty this whole shelf.And then we're probably going to move itacross like this to this way to Yeah.rotate it that way. And then we'reprobably going to move thislittle what do you call it? Like bookshelf case thingy. And we're probablygoing to move it maybe this way if wecan over here. and the desk. We're goingto be obviously because the new desk isa lot larger, we're going to need tomove this. But what we're going to dofirst is pretty much take everythingdown, the PC, the monitors, unasssemblethe desk, take it out, and then use thatspace to start building the new desk.And then hopefully then we'll see howeverything fits first. We're going tomove these things, I guess, as well, sowe have enough space to build the desk.So, that's I guess the first plan ofaction is John's going to moveeverything here and we're going todismantle the desk and then maybe startbuilding the new one. Very excited. Weshall see how it goes.[Music]Youknow, Heat. Heat.[Music][Applause][Music]Right. The state of theroom. We're going to have a little breaknow. I made some bacon sandwiches. Hereyou go.

Really?I mean, it's cool either way already.opening the new desk. So, this is thelegs of the desk.So, yeah, let's go.[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]All right. So, just a bit of an update.We managed to put the base of the tabletogether. But now we need to affix itthe table top on on it. But to get thetable top upstairs, we have to gothrough this mess. So now I'm just goingto actually start filling the mangashelves so that we can get all this outof the way and bring in the table top.So yeah, let's do that.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]me.[Music][Music]Heat[Music]uphere.

Honey.[Music]It's[Music]perfect. Heat. Heat.[Music]N. All[Music][Music]right. So, we finished organizing themanga shelf and we're ready to put wellready to build the desk finally and putit in. So, we've got the desk up here.So, we're going to open this up and thenbuild itupstairs. Oh my goodness.Ohmy. As I mentioned at the start of thevideo, this particular desk is the E7Pro, which is the next generation deskcompared to my E7. I've had my E7 fornearly a year now, and honestly, it'sbeen gamechanging. The size has beenamazing for filming those top down cleanhall videos and the standing mechanichas been amazing for my health due to mebeing able to walk while I work combinedwith my walking pad. Some of you whofollow my personal channels might knowI've been on a fitness journey and thisstanding desk has really made itpossible in making sure that I get mysteps in every day. The desk is alsoreally customizable where you caninterchange the color of the tabletopand the color of the legs as well as thedesk size itself. Obviously, as you cansee, John chose the legs in the blackcolor and then with a white tabletop. Ihave the one in both white. And he alsogot a much larger desk than me and hegot it in 180 cm length by 60 cm width.The main differences between the E7 andthe E7 Pro is definitely the enhancedstability. It also has a higher weightcapacity at 160 kg and it also has moreheight adjustment ranges as well. Itranges from 63.5 cm to 128.5 cm which isreally great for different user heights.We also noticed while unpacking andbuilding that the cable managementsystem is really good and it comes withan in-built cable management system thatmy standard E7 didn't have. I personallyreally really love my Flexis Spotstanding desk. So, if you're also on thelookout for a really sleek, really good,and highquality desk, definitely checkout Flexis Spot standing desk. I'llleave all the links down below and thelink to this one as well in thedescription box. So, definitely check itout.[Music][Music]That's for sure.[Music][Music][Music]away. All[Music]right, so we've done the big reveal. Howare you feeling about your new space? Ifeel really good. I feel really, reallygood. I feel like I've now maximize theuse of the space. There's so much spacenow, and there feels like there's loadsof breathing room, which is really good.It looks super neat, clean again.Obviously, there comes with perspectiveof what I can improve now. But yeah, no,it looks really good. Can't reallycomplain. In terms of the desk, the deskis super good. This is actually my firstever experience of a standing deskmyself, so I'm really looking forward toit. It's very smooth. I'm not going togo too high, but I'm assuming this isprobablymy standing height around about here.So, if I move this chair allway. So, if I like test Yeah. So, itlooks pretty good. My shoulders are notstrained. Go a little bithigher here. Yeah, this is perfect. Ican also register the height which lidis a pro at. So there's an Mhere and she has set it to mode two. Soevery time So if you move itdown and then I pressand it goes to my automatic height whichis amazing. And you can register yourseating height on number one. And sowhen you move it up to your standingheight, you can put it back to yourseating height instantly as well. So youcan register that once you're ready.Let's see. Okay. So now I'm going to tryand register the seatingheight. So I should be around here.Abouthere.No, I think it's fine because I like toput my arms on my desk. So, this ispretty good. All right. So, then youjust pressM and then press one and then it shouldregister. So, now you can press two andone and it should go upautomatically. We can try the standingheight. So, it's going up. It's goingup. It's going up. It's like a rocketship. And then it stops there. And thenyou can put it on your the one that youregistered on your sitting height. Andthen it should go back down aswell. And then you have both of themregistered, which means it's really,really easy for you to pretty much standup and sit down with ease. So really,really great feature for this one. andhe got the one with the black legs andthe white table top. It's looking reallygood. I think I have to go a littlefurther out to see exactly how itfits. But yeah, it's looking reallynice. I'm really happy for you that youhave a little bit more of a cleanerspace and I feel like you can do a lotmore with it. Especially you have a lotof wall space now. And you have spacedown here as well to fill things. Andthen you have the shelves. So Iorganized the shelves for him. I prettymuch did his vagabon collection up topcuz that's one of his favorites. Andthen Jiu-Jitsu Kaizen and Chas Man,which is the two of the dark three. Andthen I kept the viz media section aswell. Pretty much the same area. Sothey're all together. And then obviouslythe next ones which is for metalalchemist the really nice hardbackeditions in the middle so we can have alook and they're easily displayed. Andthen we have more of the taller vizigvolumes down here. And then more of thevizig down here. And then we were ableto fit in some of his big collectorsdeluxe editions and display the vagabonddefinitive edition which we recentlyhauled in my previous video. And thensome art books and he's got more spaceto put other things as well. So yeah,that is his manga bookshelf. That waslike a mini tour of all his manga.That's all he owns. A little bit lessthan what I earn. Just a little bit. No.Yeah, I am super pleased with the amountof work that we put in. It's been 9hoursish. 9 hours basically, but it waswell worth it. This is definitely like aa really good quality of life, I guess.But yeah, no, it's really good. I'mreally pleased. I managed to display alot of the things as well. I don't knowif Lid has showed you, but basicallythere's obviously the arcane stuffbehind. It looks really good now. andshe had a really good idea from usingthis. I guess you could call it like acloth. Myself and Lid, we did a SquareEnix order and that came for free. I hadno idea what to do with it and she had areally good idea to basically hide theugliness behind it. Feel free to displaywhat's behind it. But yeah, no, it's uhit's a super great idea. So, it's gotlike tools and stuff and wires and stuffand Yeah. No, it's really good. Got myclothes. Got like an easy easier accessof the clothes. Obviously, I would loveto have a dedicated space for like thetote bags, headphones, and my hats. So,I would probably look to hang them onthe wall at some point. But yeah, like Isaid, improvements. And I managed todisplay a lot of my limited editionstuff on the side here in the corner,which I think honestly was a really goodplacement. So, as you can see, that'slike my camera stuff, my Nandroids,limited Androids, and then we gotPersona here. It's like a Persona likefloor, I guess you can call it. Shelf.Persona shrine. A Persona shrine, Iguess you can call it. I think it needsto have a bit more. And then moving onto the FinalFantasy/ Square Enix stuff. Lastly,there's a Bayonetta slot right there.And the figures at the top of the shelfis super clean. Now, I kind of like itas is. I may look to add prints upthere, something a bit more simplisticrather than cluttering the whole shelfwith figures. But that's my initialimpressions at the moment. I'm startinga CFKA shrine as you can probably seethere. Just waiting for the figure toreleaseand it'll be complete. All right, I'mreally tired now. I helped him do a lotof stuff andthen clean up and obviously shelf hismanga, but it was definitely well worthit. And we've talked a lot already now.So, I would just say thank you so muchfor watching this video. I hope it wasfun seeing the wholereorganization. If you want to see mereorganize my room previously, you candefinitely check that out. I'll linkthat below somewhere. But I hope youenjoyed and liked seeing his new room. Ithink he's really happy with it. Are youhappy with it? Super happy. So yeah, Ihope you guys enjoyed. And make sure tolike, comment, and subscribe if youhaven't already for more manga animemerch content. And I will see you asalways in my next video. Bye.[Music]","Just the fact that you both have your own office is wonderful. I am looking forward to the new organized setup.
having separated offices was so good for my marriage, we have quality time together, but also on our own, which is very important. I'm redecorating my husband's office, but he likes brown... a lot lol so it's hard mode. you did such a great job, ty for the video
The honkai star rail, Genshin, persona, zzz merch in his room are perfect I also think his manga tastes are immaculate lmao
Such an aesthetically pleasing room, hehe.
Wow! The ARACANE LOL is nice to have! Nice collection
Miyabi wallpaper, Kafka print, ayaka plush?? Wow he has taste !!!
Besides it being white this is the dream work/gaming/chill set up i always wanted but will probably never have.
You are blessed my friend I hope u know that.
Just FYI for the best posture, for both the standing and sitting configuration, your elbows should be at about an 90° angle. 
So for him for standing 100 is a bit too low, by the looks of it it should be somewhere between 115-130,
OMG I LOVE YOUR HAIRRRRRR
This video is really so good!
SO EXCITED TO WATCH THISSSSS
i love this type bedroom!
That is the coolest hair I’ve ever seen tbh


And the room is fire
Another fantastic video
Lets go,i was waiting for another one
I'm in love with this room. You guys did an amazing job! Greetings from Ukraine!
I have a different Arcane artbook set and the box was also massive. It was way too nice not to display so I had to clear out room just for the Jinx themed box. They really killed it with all the Arcane stuff after having basically nothing for years. 

If he's looking for any more Maki Zenin statues to round off his shelf I'd rec her ArtFX J (with the bonus face). It has one of the more dynamic poses I've seen for her and she's using the playful cloud cursed tool which I don't think gets included as much even tho it was from one of the cooler early arcs.
Attendance check
OMG DREAM ROOM could I ask where you brought the manga bookshelf?
looks awesome!
i love it
Idk why this was on my feed but I love your room!
wow nice pc set up i hope someday i have a pc set up like you have.
A couple whom are both into anime is beautiful to me.. i would be so happy to be with someone like that
7:38 GYAT DAMN
Clean setup
О киса а это уже главное в доме ))
молодцы красиво
This looks so good!! What bookshelf is that?? I NEED one for my manga!
If you guys can. Id anchor that bookshelf to the wall, its pretty wiggly. Just to be safe.
Hey looks nice
my therapy
I think my only disagreement with this room is the clothing rack in the room, as it takes up space and sometimes not that great to look at. Maybe I could suggest getting a Kallax Shelf, then you can fold your hoodies and stack them up on there. Additionally, display other neat things and can get one in white to fit the color scheme nicely.
what is the LG gaming computer called, the different monitors? Also what kind of top did you get? The frame is black, but what kind of top, solid wood?
Sorry if it was asked, but what is the dimension of the space? Great work!
unorganized? looks pretty organized to me lol W vid
35:34 Where is hell's paradise 2 ???
I need to find myself a woman like Lyddie
It's like my room, but with none of this stuff...sigh xD
That tall shelf not being secured to the wall is freaking me out with the space in that room and ur cats. Pls secure it even if it seems unlikely to tip with the weight. Dont wanna risk the goods!
the keyboard under the desk?
Can I know the background screen information?
May I know where I can get that hoshimi miyabi wallpaper? I've been looking around and can't find the exact same wallpaper
Do you know the name of this computer case?
What speakers are those?
5:25 What's the top right keyboard?
what game was he playing? Also awesome video!
someone know the name of that keyboard in 31:25?
I think he might like Miyabi... just a guess
having this play in the background while painting ( •̀ ω •́ )
what job do u do to afford this
11 minutes of putting up books.... riveting...
here me who cant even afford a decent pc . sad
Ok but who did you romance in ff7 rebirth lol
Buy outy p95
日本の作品がいっぱいだ🫶
don't care just fix the lighting to be a good color
Not much of a makeover more of a spruce / tidy up
very nice vid! i think its so great that both have ur own personal space by separated! im current 19yo, but if i move later with my bf im going to follow the same plan as u guys and build our own office for each one:) im also quite nerdy with having my room with my own personality, unfortunately i dont have space for my own mangas shelve anyway u get a new sub!

isthe world's largest gaming monitor as Itry to build the largest gaming setupyou have ever seen some of these itemsyou won't find in any other setup like a98 in TV or maybe a PC so heavy it takestwo of us to carry and so much more butif I really want to build somethingmassive I have six items I need to orderstarting with the keyboard world'slargest gaming keyboard wow I'mabsolutely butchered that one red dragonk605 this thing is absolutely massive itis 200% the size of regular keyboards atthe cart so next we gothuge huge gaming desk okay hear me outhow big are the Ikea butcher blocksfirst time ever spelling somethingapparently okay hear me out Quin whathappens if we build one on the front oneon the left one on the right to make aU-shaped desk going to put togetherthree desks to make one Mega desk addthecart right huge mouse wow pretty bigmice well then this this might be itthis might be it I mean at least we gotan ergonomic design but bro look how bigthis is on her hand add the cart allright but for our main monitor I know wealready have the TV downstairs it ispart of theirxl90 line any true gaming setup doesn'tonly have one monitor it has a secondarymonitor so that's where we're going togo you got a bunch of 49 in oleds onthere Odyssey Neo but we want somethingbigger what about the Odyssey art sothis thing is coming in at 55 in 4k 165HZ I mean at this point you might aswell just classify that as a TV add tocard we got a lot of power in thisgameing sets the most important we gotto find a massive PC let me see here 10biggest cases in 2025 so I have beenreading a lot about this one so it's theCorsair9000d so as you can see it can fit up to18 fans accommodates six ssds five hddsthis thing actually before you build itit weighs in at 65 lb and they have anestimate once you get this fully loadedit's over 100 lb just for the PC casedud look at that look how much roomwe're going to have in that okay epicart 500 bucks for just a PCcase this is great how much have youspent so far well you were supposed tohave the money tracker above us oh sorryyeah put that up thank you now that wehave the PC case we just need to finishbuilding out the PC and since we'realready on corsair's website I'm goingto go ahead and grab a power supply anaiio some RAM and all 18 fans for thiscase but don't worry we still have thetwo most important pieces being an theI9 14900 k and a 4090 graphics card Idon't think I've ever seen moneydisappear from my wallet as fast as itdid right there but thankfully all weneed to wait for is for all this to shipout now I think this setup is going tobe a tad bigger than what we'reexpecting I mean we did get our 18 fansin here you got the 55in Odyssey Arc butthere's one thing that I have to mentionis whenever your PC case says carefulit's heavy and on the side it says itrequires a team lift you know things aregoing to get a little crazyoh wow what a PC case this PC buildscares me though because between a 98 in4K TV as our main monitor to oursecondary monitor being a 55 in 4kdisplay I don't know how this PC isgoing to hold up but before we get tothe build I have to give a huge shoutout to Corsair for partnering with us onthis video because they ended up sendingus a piece C case a power supply Ram AIOand don't worry we didn't forget aboutthefans oh crap and just in case youwondering 10 12 14 16 18 plus yourradiator plus three fans on the GPUthat's you're going to have like 25 fansin this thing but the final spec listboast that this is one of the fastestPCS that you can build right now I meanbetween a 14900 K processor to 4090 GPUand clocking in with 64 GB of ddr5 RAM Idon't think this puppy will have anyissues handling multiple 4K displays nowthat we tested the PC and we got it onon the very first try you're going tohave to trust me on that one we're goingto take it back down build the rest ofthe setup now you may be wondering toyourself man it looks a little bitdarker like the sun kind of went downand wow they installed the secret gamingroom entrance doors no we weren't uphere that long we literally justfinished clearing out the entire livingroom here in the gaming house so youguys better like this video Andsubscribe but now we got to add in thebase of it the gaming desk now to standout from your overused typical Ikeagaming desk we put three of these badboys together to make sure we had enoughspace for this massive setup well nowthat we got the desks all set up thatonly means one thing it's time to getthis party started and get our gamingsetup on it first up is our Shack sizedkeyboard and like I mentioned earlierthis keyboard is 200% larger than yournormal keyboards how am I supposed touse like w ASD to move and jump but nextup we got the massive scroll wheel ofdeath now I would be lying to you if Ididn't say this piece of the setupscares me the most because it doesn'tmove like an ordinary Mouse but ratheryou use this big red ball right here tomove your cursor around which is goingto make my life miserable trying toscroll across two massive displays thatwe just installed combining for153 in of displays just because I don'tthink you guys realize how big thiskeyboard is this is you this is the guyshe tells you not I mean I'm so sorrynow that we got our peripherals andmonitors installed it's time for themain event the PC but let me remind younow that we have the PC fully built outit is weighing over 100 lb I mean it'sso large you can fit a whole other PCinside of it and not to mention it makesall the components inside lookabsolutely tiny and I would like toremind you guys this is a 4090 in thisbuild it doesn't get any bigger thanthat but this is where we ran into ahuge issue as we were getting everythingconnected I realized that both the TVand the Odyssey Arc monitor were HDMIports and the graphics card that'scurrently in my PC only has one HDMIplugin so after hours of trying tofigure out a solution we ended upconnecting everything through theSamsung hub which I know sounds like asimple solution but as we were trying toget this connected the Samsung hub didnot want to display both monitors to myPC but let me tell you guys wherethere's a will there's a way so we wereable to figure it all out and still ableto use the main TV for our game and ofcourse have that ultimate brain rot ofSubway Surfers on the secondary monitorall right it's the moment we've all beenwaiting for it has been hours the sunhas set it is literally dark outside butwe have the entire setup ready to go sothe last thing we got to do is puteverything to the test and see if we canactually just get one kill I know mostof the challenges are like hey can youwin a game of fortnite no if you don'tsee that Mouse over there and thatkeyboard we're going for one kill to seeif anything in this setup is actuallypractical now we have been talkingNon-Stop about how big this setup wasbut I didn't realize how difficult thiswas going to be a game on it until I satdown I mean the keyboard itself was sobig I could barely press two keys at thesame time and don't you dare even get mestarted on this mouse pray for me Joelgreater or lesser than 3% that I get akill on the first drop in probablylesser but I'm glad you have so muchconfidence in me oh my gosh dude are wedropping boys I'm not even worried I'mnot even worried we're getting a solid30 frames up there so do you feel likeyou're at the advantage absolutely not DI can hardly press e to pick up a weaponon this thing oh mygosh this is so bad I think this is abottoo 3% my rear end did I go against abot just maybe but now that I haveconquered our first obstacle of seeingif I can actually get a kill on thisthing let's see how the rest of thematch goes my hands are cramping up Idon't know if I can finish the wholegame I can't even go and press m for themap look I can't run and press M Iliterally my pinkies cramping pressingshift oh they don't even know you knowwhat I think we're just going to go forthe win that's it this setup isUN that really went differently in myhead all right if we were to categorizethis entire setup to least the best I'mgoing to go the worst thing in the setupit's the mouse that thing is unusablebut then that keyboard I mean the factthat I was like literally trying get mypinky to hit shift to run not usable PCTV monitor I mean all these things arestuff that people normally use overallthe setup I probably won't be playing onit again just because of how impracticalthe screen size is also but if you guysare looking for a screen size that isplayable make sure to check out mymonitor video here but we'll see you onthe next one,"0:37 dilido toys is crazy
RIP electricity bill
For a house that size, you definitely need a setup like this.
This setup remembers me off when I was a child and how I saw the world
I'm just glad there's someone on YouTube to test the set ups that us people say what if
We see that search history
5:53 Bro forgot about the chair
I am a first time viewer but i actually love this, i loved the vid and everything but i would recommend if you could use it as a racing simulator with the huge screen it would be amazing. That’s all best of wishes!
No big chair :(
that PC is actually insane - amazing video brother
i would be sleeping on the couch if i purchased these lol
You know when small kids use adult size stuff and you're all like ""aww how cute!"" 
Ridiculously fun to watch you pain through it haha
Also the gaming house looks beautiful bro!
3:38 just in CASE (pun?)
W chair
2:42 bro a 4090 from ebay
0:37 human [______] is crazy
-Wants to build a ""massive"" pc

*doesn't buys a threadripper

Nah man, that's not going to be massive at all
Wow this was MASSIVE! it really got my LOW expectations high, and made my views on a normal PC TAPER and FADE
Tiny Chair ?
7:26 You had your fps locked
What about the 50 series?
+99 missed calls from shaq
Why 30fps with 4090?
6:25 The largest chair?!
Underrated channel, you definitely deserve more subs
trackballs, for those not used to them, do take a bit of time to get adjusted to. And like gaming mice, they also have adjustable DPS settings which would make it easier to use.. i hope you didnt give up on it.. Personally, I want someone.. ANYONE.. to make a gaming capable clone of the old $20 Logitech Trackman Marble (the slightly larger than a normal mouse with the trackball in the center front, and buttons on either side of the ball.) I get Gameball makes one, but $200 for one isn't in my price range

i get the theme of the video was biggest everything. but I have to guess you did swap back to a standard sized KB and mouse afterwards
The min Fan Speed was never more important
This reminds me of MrWho’sTheBoss really cool! Little expensive though lol
Just my thoughts. 

Not the largest gaming PC setup and less enjoyable than other options. Start with modular displays that have high pixel density. Expensive yes, but when there is a problem you replace a part instead of replacing everything. Also can always add/remove panels or create a non standard display shape (can be useful).

As for the PC setup itself. Start with motherboard stands and mount to the frame of modular screen setup, creating custom mounts for pc parts (video cards, HDs, extension cards, etc.) with standoffs and aluminum extrusions. Hide HID pref cabling in the display frame to the desktop and a single cable to a dock or USB extensions for dongles.
the tower 900 here! maxed out. my pc weighs 100 pounds. my monitor is the acer predator 43 inch and I'm running klipsch 12 inch 600 watts subwoofer with monitors at 200 watts. Welcome aboard to the massive pc users.
0:17 did you say Massive
wOw!!! that's a dream set-up for me. Thanks for sharing...
Put a Mini ITX parts into this case.
Should ran dual 5090s that woulda been INSANE
Aside for the cool setup you've got an amazing physique man congrats !
why no Ryzen i9 processor????
this video deserves way more views and likes
this setup is very MASSIVE. just like my LOWWWWW TAPERRRRR FADEEEEEEE
@5:35 this is just embarrassing as a pc builder
Why not amd? r9 9900x?
surprised you didn't go with threadripper. 64 core 7980X is the obvious choice
Calling a trackball a mouse 

But in all reality, switching from mouse to trackball comes with a decent learning curve, especially to an office/productivity one like the Ellecom Huge. Ellecom's Deft Pro has much better ergonomics for gaming!
I'm gonna lie bro, this is sick
You could make a beast pc with this massive case
8:30 Normalyyyyyyy!!!! Huhhhhh Bro i have a 2060
We got shaq's gaming setup revealed 
Btw love the vids
That PC ain't having heat problems for a entirety
Ngl this deserves more views
I just saw this same big monitor at Best Buy and would definitely buy this if I could
Bigger does not equal better. I find it much harder to take everything in on a monitor that's too big for my field of vision.
holy crap how is this video and channel so underrated
This guy deserves more views this was a very expensive build
Nah the electricity bills abt to be wildin
BRO YOU’RE MISSING THE WORLDS BIGGEST CHAIR ??..?
I’m tryna get that desk!! Where is that from!?
I have the odyssey ark too , I need to hit the gym cause u lifted it up on the desk like it was nothing
It looks like you made a mini itx build in an atx case
why no one on youtube has made a comparison video of odyssey ark with other odyssey models... its so confusing at this point. the only plus point for me in odyssey g9 is that it has oled , other than that everything is better in odyssey ark... can you pleaseeeee make a comparison video of comparing other monitors with odyssey ark? pls pls pls there is no one else on yt who can afford it ig
Where’s the chair!
am i tripping or did you pair a 750w psu with an i9 and 4090?! the 14900k alone pulls like 500w.
Lol that massive setup with a little stool
Damn bro 
Its worth the watch but damn
Prices be much
Imagine donating 1/10 of all expenses to one minor YouTuber
why not a 9800 x3d
How could the largest gaming setup not have a projector to project an IMAX-size screen?
3:34 One man, a lot of fans challenge
This is the kind of setup that Shaquille O'Neal would have
you should put a smart bulb so you can change the colour of the room and then it will look like a gaming room
BRO IS GONE MAD
Insanely Outstanding....
New fan here..
Your videos are so amazing sir. Keep it up for making new contents ..
My pc case is about half size and it takes at least two people to lift it. Imagine how many people it takes to move this
Whynnot get a display port to HDMI adapter/cable? It took me 2 mins to figure that out when i first started with my rx 580
Bro that setup was Massive
Bro forgot about the 5090
Video Is Good obv
But His Arms got me inspiration !
Give this gaming set up to Shaquille
You forgot the hugest gaming chair buddy.
great video !!!
why not a threadripper?
next time use a cable with HDMI on one end and Display on the other.
0:16 u know what else is massive
5:12 is sooooo funny
Now THIS is gaming content
The shaq gaming setup fr
Yo your videos are so good why don’t they have more views and likes????
Gaming monitor is basically a tv
0:29 massive
Broo next time make the worlds most expensive pc
shaq's gaming setup:
you cold have got a roku or smart tv that connect wirelessly and you could've clicked windows and k you can connected the wireless display
Bros tv capped at 3” hz and had vsync on 2 and was like “I’m running 30 frames”
will a HDIM splitter work for the moniter and TV
low taper fade
Max it out with 9800x3d and 5090
Thank you for keeping the meme Massive
These brainiacs didn't wire up all the fans. $80 worth of exhaust fans doing nothing.
Mans just built shaq a whole gaming setup
What about the 5090
This is you.... And this is the guy she tells you not.... I'm sorry.....
I think you forgot when TimtheTatMan streamed some games from the Dallas Cowboys stadium (using their Jumbotron as well)

This was so well edited and produced! Was shocked that you are a newer YouTuber. I love the cadence and slower/relaxed speed of the voice over, it’s super refreshing (esp for these types of videos). Can’t wait to see what’s next for your channel
Really nice bro seems a clean and neat setup made on a budget 
Great work keep it up
I love this bro
Mad setup brother, you have earned a follower here from Malaysia!
Great setup, I’m like watching Mathew Encina of modekeyboards, keep it up brother..
this is so inspiring sir! Someone from Philippines!
Amazing setup!
it looks great man! great job!
Nice setup, really liking the wood
awesome bro .inspiring
W vid, your channel is about to blow up
random recommendation. very nice!
Hey man, saw you on Ed's setup wars. I'm filipino myself, and I wanted to ask what docking station you have. Specifically the one under your desk where you connect your HDMI, ethernet, etc. We have the same kind of laptop but mine is only the ideapad and it doesn't support thunderbolt c Not sure with the LOQ. It needs a separate display link adapter to make a third extra monitor work. Kasi used na rin ang HDMI ko. Sobrang solid ng setup bro! Hoping to get the same feel.
This guy loves Emilia-
hehehe...salamat may napili na rin ako sa mga item mo...
hello sir wow ganda ng home set-up mo sa pc mo...i like the table tsaka kung saan nakalagay yung mga alaga mong laruan
susundan ko ito
Deserve more followers
Maybe Your laptop is Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 not Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 because the left side of the Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 Laptop has absolutely no connection port
i like the best waifus corner
Nice setup, does the xiaomi g pro 27i has give you any kind of problem in daily use due to flickering? Im Planning to buy it and I literallly use the pc al most all day
boss may link ka nung table mo sa kanan? yung pinatungan ng mario and minion? :)
I'm getting goon cave vibes
How did you get the light bar on the monitor? I have the same ones and they just do not fit in
LOQ or LEGION? it can handle 2 tb m.2?
Change the position of your laptop, it doesn't align with the height of the monitor. OCD iykyk!!

Long overdue. We'refinally building this gaming setup at astudio. And we're at where any goodgaming setup begins. Orange County,California. Let's go. I don't know whatI'm getting. How much you think I'mgoing to spend?[Music]I have a checklist of things that weneed for this setup. Starting with thePC. I already have one, but we'll seewhat they have because maybe I'llupgrade my PC. Hey, of course we come onthe most busy day. 5080s. 5080s. I wasreally hoping for a 5090. Maybe we won'tupgrade the PC today. I really want onethough. Low key. Should I just get itanyways even though it's not a 5090? No.How long you think I need? Long enough.Six. [ __ ] one of these. Oh, they gotcable management stuff. Oh, I need that[ __ ] bro. Yeah, you do. My [ __ ] Weshould make a video fixing Josh's setupone day. We should show him my PC withthe leg stand. That [ __ ] tilt, dude.There's a lot of zip ties here, but tobe honest, zip ties are overrated andit's a lot of work if you want to takeit down. Something like this is a littlebetter because it's velcro, like velcroties, and it's easier to take off. Youdon't have to cut them. Something likethis as well, just to like tidy up thecables together. I know I'm going toforget something. That's That's theproblem. You have the Ethernet cablealready, right? Yeah, we need that. Ishould have had a plan. I never have aplan. It's like the most boring microcenter haul ever. We'll get some morecool stuff. What the What is that? Yougot to buy a new camera. No, that'sscared me. I'm broke. Hey Josh, you needa new blow dryer. Tell me why I walkedin his room once. He's using anelectronic air duster to dry his hair.I'm like, ""Bro, I got one. I should usemine."" It wasn't even blowing air, but Iwas blowing dust exposing me. You don'tneed no RGB. Oh, check. That boy tall.You might need Sony monitors. Sonymonitors. I think we have one. Probablynot the same one cuz this new ever. Oh,that's a new new one. Yeah, this onejust came out probably have this oneright here. It looks like has like thesame stand. So, this one's 480 Hz. Wait,they're both 480 Hz. Wait a minute.Similar specs. It's 2K 480. This is 2K480. Is that same size? 27 in. I'll beright back, man. We're in the monitorsection. It was looking grim. Normally,I'd also need to pick up a monitor, butI already have one at home uh thanks toSony. They have one in stock and I'm washoping to have a dual monitor setup, sothey're going and they're grabbing itfor me right now. Oh, you got it for meright there. Here you go. All right,guys. Oh, it is the same monitor. Is itthe same monitor? Bang. Yeah. Yeah, thesame name. Sort of the same box. Is thisthe last one? It's the only one. Thankyou, guys. Have a good one. Let's go.With this monitor, it's the first timeI'm not buying monitor mounts because ofthe design of the monitor mount. It'sactually pretty sick. And I'll show youguys more later. I think we're good.That's a wrap for Micro Center. UnlessJosh, you want some? Yeah. $10,000. Buyas much as you want. $50 for a cable? Idon't know if I want it that bad. $50?Oh, it's the goat. The goat. This islike the LeBron of esports, bro. It'scrying out.Actually, is the goboy. What you know about this? Come on,bro. Stop playing. What you know aboutthis?Only one they had.Is that crazy?[Music]Help me out.[Music]Black and white. One, two. Car has aura.You already know what where you at.Somehow we always end up here in everyvideo, right Josh? Like I swear I don'tcome here all the time. Yeah, we're justgetting like a bunch of desk accessoriesand a countertop for the table. [ __ ] inthe car, bro. What? Don't say that.[Music][Music]It's been a while since you guys haveseen the studio. This area is a totalmess, but we're working on it. We gotsome small progress here. The KiloEscape has made a return. We got somerandom jumbosized Pokémon cards. Shoutout to Cracks Toys, my boy Matt. SomePro Grails. This little area is kind ofcool. We got Josh eating this littleshell. I love this area. This plant ishuge now. I got this plant a year ago.Look how much it's grown. It's all theway over here now. You guys rememberthis living room. We turn around. We gota live streaming setup. By the way, letme turn this light on. Much better. Thishas been a lot of fun. Bubble M is thegreatest Pokémon card ever made. Car'shere.But yeah, this is like the last part ofthe studio. I really need some seriouswork. There's this big wall over here.I'm going to clear all of this out andthen build my new gaming setup.It's been a while since I actually hadWell, okay. I have a gaming setup athome, but it's kind of like a makeshiftsetup. Plan to have this place for along time. So, this setup is very, verypermanent. But also, we're taking a verydifferent approach than his setups inthe past. I still stream, not as much.So, the main focus here is it lookinggood, not the functionality. Although,I'm not going to build a setup that'simpractical to use.[Music]One problem. So, tabletop thing that webought, it's too small cuz like thispiece is supposed to connect the twolegs, but um as you can tell, it'staller than the desk. And then this thisis the top. The depth of the desk isalso smaller. I realized what I didwrong cuz when I bought this frame, itwas supposed to originally be for abigger tabletop. I get what you mean.So, it's going to be like hanging likeYeah. Yeah. So, we got a new one. Oh mygoodness. Things always go wrong.Finally, since the last clip that youguys saw, it's been about 3 or 4 days. Iwent to the bay, visited family, andalso went to a Warriors game. We went ona whole mission today just to get thistable top. I know it doesn't look likeanything special, and trust me, itisn't, but it's exactly what I waslooking for.So, this is birch plywood. I got it fromHome Depot. It's finished already. Um, Imight have to stand up and fix up acouple random things, but it's wood.It's never going to be perfect, and I'mperfectly fine with it being unfinishedor like not perfect. Long story short,we went to a Home Depot. They had thewood that we wanted. Pause. But themachine to cut the wood didn't work. Andoriginally this was 4 ft deep, which istoo long for a desk, but I feel likethis is basically perfect. Now, themoment of truth is making sure that thisthing fits on this thing. 1,000% Ishould have measured it. Oh, barely.It's like an inch. So, I don't know ifyou can see,but yeah, we're good. It clears. This isgoing to be a sick desk. By far the mostunique desk I've ever built. And it'ssuper simple. So, perfect. Step numberone, we got to build this frame. Then,I'm debating whether or not I actuallywant to put or drill or glue thecountertop to the frame itself or justput it on top and then put like rubberor something so it doesn't, you know,scrape or scratch. We'll cross thatbridge when we get there.[Music]What is in here?Sounds like screws.Voila.Tons of them.These are like the little feet thing.And then there's a little beam in themiddle to make sure everything's stable.Hey,perfect. No, this is exactly how I wantit. This desk is huge. This desk ishuge. The way we rock. Scary. Live lifeon the edge. It's It's massive, bro.Hey, it looked better, huh? Big olddesk. Have you ever seen a gaming setupdesk this big? Yeah, it looks like adining table. Lookie. Nice. 3 2 1[Applause]Weno.[Music][Music]What do you think? Are youall the way? No.Nice.Cool. So, desk is mostly done. This isprobably the coolest desk I've everowned. Not the most unique desk, but Ithink it's pretty different for likegaming setups. What you think, Josh?Yeah. Jump on it.It finally break it out. Okay, so fromhere, I'd probably normally startbuilding the actual setup itself. What Iwant to do is start putting this stuffon the wall. Start with mounting thestuff. Have these pegboards. Probably goeven from the middle, left and right. Ialso have this shell, which I'llprobably go offset onto this sidebecause I already have a basketball loopright there.[Music]I want it to be like[Music][Music]Can't help myself. See what this feelslike with a real chair. I've alwayswanted a desk. It's huge. It's a new dayand I recruited alltime greats.He brought in the big guns. Oh yeah. Ialways had this dream to get thismassive desk, but also I didn't realizethat it would like bend this much. So Itook a quick trip to IKEA and yeah,let's do this earn stuff. Well, time toget to work. Since this desk is so thin,I have to use like the thinnest screwsever. Like, they're so tiny. What? It'llbe fine, right? Yeah.They're um half an inch because the deskthickness is 38 of an inch. Y'all shouldsee my POV right now.Big ass eyes. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. So,y'all see I think you guys can see howmuch it's bending just by that thatspot.Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have muchfaith in these little screws, butOh, if you're wondering why I have twowhite dogs, one is our friend. Yeah.Looks good. No more bend. Missionaccomplished. So, with the desk done, wecan now get to building the actual setupitself. Monitor stand is so cool. Theyprobably get mad at me for doing this,too, huh? And any good setup starts withthe monitor. Thankfully, while Sony sentme that one, I bought this one. Andalso, this video is sponsored by Sony.Micro Center had one last one of theSony M10S monitor. For any setup ofmine, at least especially gaming setups,you need to have at least two monitors.The Sony M10S is a monster performerdisguised as a minimalistic productivitymonitor. The chassis and design languagescream simple, but the specs scream topof the line. 480 Hz, 27 in OLED, QHD1440p, small bezels, easy setup,lightweight, minimalistic stand, and athin display with a innovative coolingsystem. I genuinely can't name anythingwrong with the M10s. Oh yeah, and as Imentioned earlier, this is the firsttime I'm completely ditching a deskmount. I still have nightmares trying tomount 30 lb monitors. Not fun at all.But with this, I feel like I'm notsacrificing anything at all. All whilehaving no compromise on performance, I'mall in. I've been able to use my otherSony M10S for about a month already.Loved it so much I went out of my way tobuy another and Sony doesn't even knowthat. While they are the sponsor oftoday's video, I will say if thismonitor has taught me anything, it'sthat the days of going for the highestrefresh rate monitor and ignoringeverything else are over for me. I stillremember when 240 Hz was all the craze.Now double that and add every premiumquality of life feature into awell-designed chassis and you'll findthis monitor, the Sony M10S. You cancheck it out with the link in my bio.Sony, thank you again for sponsoringthis video and helping me build my dreamgaming setup for like the 75th time.Okay, so this is going to go up. So thenthis is going to go like this. And thenthey like[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]$50.[Music]It was orange. So I had to[Music]like this thing's a smiley face.real ones from like my community and thestreams know the importance of thesmiley face. So, if you know, you know,we also had to cut it. Shout out toErnstell for the idea. I would havenever never thought of that. Hey,hey,it should be in the middle of this andthis way. No, I don't really know wherethe[Laughter]Give me that.A little cricket. Like just shimmy me itthis way. Just Oh,yeah. That's good. Perfect. Thisactually does look cool.All right. Taking this off.All right. So, this is a magazine I gotplaying basketball, but it's signed byKD. Oh, wait. I should move this.Thought this would be a good place forit, too. And it's orange with thepegboard. I didn't know what to put onit, but I think it looks okay for now. Idon't need to overdo it. Yeah.[Music]I always wanted this mic cuz it's white.Oh my god. Are you okay?Is it okay? We're good. Is it recording?Yeah. Oh my god. Chat broke his lens.How much is the lens? Two racks. Betterget a million views. I don't even wantto record anymore. Where should I putthis? Well,thank God. Hey, Sony, how about wesponsor a lens video?[Music][Music]It's day three building in the setup andtoday we're going to finish it. Right,Josh? Mhm. I'm about to I'm about totell himwhat theall my hard work. Here's a littleprogress report of where we're at.Thanks to Ernstell for helping meyesterday. Put it on the desk. Hey Har,what you think? No. No. Come back. Har,say cheese. The crazy part is that shegoes on the table at home. Um, afterWhat happened? Huh? Still my toe. No.What happened to my tripod?We got this picture up yesterday.Decorated a little bit, of course. Gotthe monitor set up. I put the 151Charizard right here. I think I want toput the full evolution. I feel like thatwould be sick. That sucks. What? Youdon't got it.You did it again.That's you, bro. It's tough. Remember myold sub um sub emotes? S smiley faces.Josh, if I put you in charge of cablemanagement, you think you can do it?Do you mind? It's everywhere. Today,we're starting with cable management cuzclearly uh well, I don't have that manycables plugged in yet, but it's the mostimportant part of any any setup, period.I got this big old desk. So, that's mymission. This shouldn't be that hard.I'm going to start with this powerstrip. We got to get it mounted righthere. Um, I don't really have an exactidea of where I'm going to put it. Ijust kind of put it somewhere and thencall it a day. This a good spot, right?All right. Can you hold that side up?This is so weird. Hurry up, bro. No, I'mlowkey enjoying my time down here. [ __ ]Hurry up.All right. I should do the other side,huh? Yeah.Oh my dog.Why are you still here?I kind of want to move the uh cablemanagement thing to the left, too.This is going to be pretty boring, butumlots of cables. I'll update you when Ihave something else.maybe some advice or insight for peopletrying to manage their cables. A problemmost people run into when building agaming setup is that their cables aretoo short and that's why they can'tcable manage it. Definitely invest insome longer cables. I usually if it's ashort distance, I do at least 6 ft. Thisone's 6 ft. This one's 10 ft.And I even got an extension for like apower extension just in case I neededit. Things like this always make adifference. In the past, I would gosuper crazy with the cable management,but in all honesty, like I'm lazy,especially now. So, I just bought thislittle like rack thing. I'm just goingto put all the cables on there. It's notthat big of a deal to me. As long as thecables aren't touching the floor orhanging, um, then I did my job. Andespecially cuz I know I'm the type ofperson that likes tochange gear. And see, like, look howshort this cable is. But I'm the type ofperson person that likes to change gearand nicely cable managing everything isnot the move when that's the type ofperson I am. Also, I know I used tonever use these things, but somemonitors have like a little cablemanagement thing right here. Definitelyuse them because they're there for areason. Also, when you have a really bigdesk, um cables are going to be likethis. And the only way to really make itlook nice are cable sleeves.So, you know, the cables won't be gone.You can't magically just make themdisappear,but at least you can make it look neat,and that's that's the whole goal here.I'm going to cut this, but I'll show youguys what it looks like after.Would you look at that?Careful. All right. So, I'm in a littlebit of a predicament. I want to put thePC like tucked off in the corner foronce because I always put it on theright side of the desk, but I didn'tthink about how the cables would just besticking out over here and that kind ofit don't make me feel good. So Josh saidI should put a plant here. I was like,""Well, Josh, you actually had a goodidea for once."" This is what I decidedon. I just moved that plant to theground and pushed the um side tableback. But we'll plug everything in andthen I'll try my best to use the cablesleeves to make it look kind of tidy.Obviously cables are cables and they'regoing to be there, but hopefully itlooks okay.One thing about me, it's about thedetails. Got an orange XLR cablefor absolutely no reason. I don't knowif you can tell, but I've been likingorange recently.[Music]Make sure to keep your XLR cablesseparated from the rest of your cables,or else you'll get static in your mic.And another thing, these Velcro ties areway better than zip ties, no matter whatanyone says. Not my best work, but umgood enough for me. You got nuts in hisback. Yeah.What the Why are you not petting me? Hedon't want you to do that no more. Whyyou still crouch like that?Yeah,yeah,yeah. Look, look. It's like I'm racingon father time. Hard to see the visionwhen you only see dollar signs. Stick toplan A cuz the B feel like compromise.Thinking [ __ ] sweet. This the like theydon't advertise. Supposed to use yourvoice, but when you do, you getostracized. Overall, I'm really happywith how it turned out. Feel like theblue here contrasts really well with allthe orange. I added some little detailsbecause well, I love this bag and it'sone of the coolest collabs in gaminghistory up there. Of course, I had toput the Dreamcast. Something about theart on these boxes just looks so cool.And it's nice to have this much space onthe right side of my desk cuz usually myPC is there. And as much as I love myPC, which is still my old PC, the onethat I had at at the house in my setupthere, I just moved it. I like howsimple it looks while still being verycolorful, lots of contrast, and at theend of the day, still me. That chairisn't permanent. I have another chairover there, but um yeah, it's just kindof here for now. Every time I've donelike an all-white setup or a mostlyblacked out setup, it didn't well, itlooked cool, but it didn't really feellike me. This This feels like me. If youremember my original setups, there was alot of black and white contrast. I thinka lot of people try to go for one or theother. The white and the black justcontrast so well. More minimalistic yetstill unique and interesting. Let meknow you think and appreciate you guysfor watching. I'll work on a studio tour","i think the desk legs are upside down, that metal bar going across the floor is supposed to lay under the top part of the desk so it wont sag

SLEEP?
A pool table in a gaming room with all the mood lighting is so awesome
For me, just don’t break anything. You can be player 1. You can adjust stuff, just don’t lose them. Don’t rage.
This is not a gamer room. This is a fu**ing paradise.
If a gamer invites me to their gaming room with these rules, I won't even think about coming back
As a gamer with a room similar to this, I feel like I'd be more welcoming.
The most strictest gaming room ever
“Don’t bring girls we are scared of them”
""do not breathe too much""
Bro he sounds like a teacher talking about games
1. Touch whatever you want, just dont break it.
2. You see ""trash"", ask if its trash or not.
3. Grab a snack and a drink from my xbox mini fridge. 
4. Maybe you can take a game borrowed, so as be player n°1. 
5. Sit wherever you want and grab the controller you want. 
What's this? School? Rules are lame. Being more welcoming is better (with some limits of course).
All of them correct but i have one more rule
Dont borrow any devicy unless we let you
I followed the rules and never got a second invite
He has a fucking pool table.
Ye I'm familiar with the rules of gaming rooms thank you very much
Him pushing Minecraft off the table offended me
This dude is way to strict I would never come over again
Bro’s got a whole entire theater arcade room
You’re gaming room is awesome 10 out of 10
Is it just me, or did he say “Never get player number 1, your always player number 1️”
Next time I’m just going to stay home
“no your not allowed to breathe its too loud and will distract the gamer!” ahh be like
PERFECT LOOP
When I go to my friends gaming room I just sit in the beanbag chair and not move bc I’m an actual walking disaster
""Your oppinion doesn't count"" awww what a good friend
I use to have a friend that hated Fortnite let’s just say HE ONLY WANTED TO PLAY MINECRAFT and it was berock
bro even if i didn’t know these rules i would stand there awkwardly either way
Bro is like:-
Do not put your feet on the floor
Don't blink
Dont even breathe
this whole room is just awesome
I wish I had a like good laptop thats legit all I want. But if I did have a room like this then my only rule would be to not break anything cause after all they are guests so you have to welcome them.
I teared up........ it's beautiful 🥹
im a chill guy
Nobody realizes that he is damn right and yes you can play just dont optimize stuff or break something. IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO FOLLOW THESE RULES
How to be single:

Be this guy
Yeah now u need to follow rules to enter a room second time that sets you apart from touching grass for eternity
Sick set up
They aren’t gonna want a second invite if you have such strict rules
Ty for understanding me finely
My friend who literally lets me play Minecraft on his PC in his top notch gaming room
Im a gamer ahh vid
For me I have so much trash when ever my freinds come over they always clean my setup lol
Bro you have such a cool gaming room 
It’s a paradise
that's not a gaming room
its my goddamn dreammmmm
GAMING ROOM 2???
I agree with most of this but not the game choosing one bc they can totally choose
Bro you set up is crazy I only have a 30 hz monitor with a nintindo switch
Even though I don’t have a game room my number one rule is always, I am first player!
i need to show this to my friends
OH YEAH FOR THE IMPERIUM!!!
Respect of ur figures i luv dbz
My friend has one of the most expensive gaming room in town and he doesn't behave like that. 
Whenever i go to his gaming room, there is always two boxes of pizza and some sodas waiting, i would recline his chair, wash my greasy hand and we would play for hours. And when its time to go home, he would give me some games to go home with.
I think most of them are reasonable but picking the game is 100% something that you can habe agency in aswell
This is the difference between a gamer and a friend ngl
I’m a gamer. I am and when my friends come round, I let them play what game they want. I let them choose what game they want but I did break something in my room. They broke my PS5. They punched it but I forgive them but I also broke my doorbut I forgive them.
Respect him to have ps4 cd's
Bro my friends break all these rules in my gaming room
With those rules i don't want anymore to go into a gamer's room
If the rules are like this,Im not going to gamer's room.
Yo your gaming room is sick, how much did it cost?
If im a gamer with that room i would allow them to do anything they want but they can't throw the ""trash"" or lose something when they adjust the setup

I love tech and automation, I'm constantly updating and sharing DIY and tech reviews, please do subscribe! Free giveaways on my Tiktok and Instagram\n\nFor product review and collabs, please email me at gameroomtheater@gmail.com",this is a highly anticipated video thatyou guys often wait for I've done thisevery year in this video guys I'm goingto be talking about all the upgradesthat happen in 2024 the plans that Ihave in 2025 to swap out some of thetech and DIY projects and things that Ican recommend and during the course ofthis video I'm just going to Pepper inas I stop by certain places as Iremember what has come in and whathasn't it's going to be somewhatdisorganized but I want to be able tojust speak my mindand talk to you guys directly so I'm notgoing to be heavily editing this videoas I head over to CES tomorrow so gomake sure that you guys follow me onInstagram at Game Room Theater and I'llbe sharing a lot of content there so I'mgoing to start back in this corner asyou can see a lot has definitely changedin2024 um I re I changed the configurationof the seating this is Valencia Theaterseating um it's their Prestige line andGuys these are now almost 3 years oldI've always worried about this pianofinish and um you know people put theirphones down their jewelry or whateveryou know the backs of watches it isslightly scratched up as you can see maymaybe you can just barely make it out Ijust cleaned this and I just vacuumedthe seats for this video um but you canyou can certainly see some indents andimperfections but overall held up reallyreally nicely I changed up theconfiguration becauseuh you know I had three seats there andtwo here thinking I can't do this longof a line it'll close off the space toomuch to to enter but I realized when Imeasured it out that uh it's going to beabsolutely fine cuz this is the mainviewing that you get you know sitting inthese three uh I mean sure you you youhurt your neck a little bit but it's notas bad as people often comment in myvideos that these guys you know hisfriends that sit in these seats mightget cramps not really I mean this isbarely a 30° angle and my perspective onit is I wanted to still feel like astadium where you know seating issurrounding this so I have some extraseating when people come over that Ifold out and put out there uh which Iusually end up on by the way cuz I youknow I like treating my guests so thatthey're comfortable that they're cateredto and they're looked after before I amso it's a blessing to have guests andyou know anyway I'm getting distractedbut long and short of it I wanted tofeel like a stadium around this thingand that's why I have seating here aswell and plus I can't I can't putseating there uh it would really closeoff the space and I can't add moreseating here because there's no entry tothis area then so I've made peace withit this is how I'm I'm going to have itand uh and that's kind of it as for thistable nothing's really changed if youguys remember this is a table from soberdesign uh coffee table drinks are alwaysnearby I love my Barbie cans uh anywayand then on top of thisthis I change up and theme up often thereason why I do that I know it's sofreaking extra but I love it guys um youknow this is my seat I love this seatbecause as you know usually people comeover they're sitting on this side sorryI just hit the the camera um but uh whenI'm sitting here I I like being able tosee all of this and the my otherfavorite seat because you know this isjust way too close to the to the giantscreen is this because then I can seeeverybody and everything like especiallyif for hosting a party I like look atthat look at that view let me just letme just zoom in a little bit look at theview from here guys it's uh you knowI've had uh it's it's it's reallysurreal for me how this all turned outanyway going on into this space again uhyou know I've changed this up many timeswhere I theme it out as if I'm at theevent right like you know say you're atSofi stadium and they have this awesomemini Jumbotron there this is from miniJumbotron decom by the way I have avideo on this where I've automated andshow live stats and you know there's agame on Rangers versus the capitals uhgoing on right now I have a full DIYvideo you guys if you already follow meyou may have already seen that so anywayI love changing this out and creatingthat atmosphere of watching a big gameand being there craziness with tickersand lighting and people are like oh myGod it's a crazy sensory overload you soyou do things that uh are to your tasteuh to my taste this feels like thecraziness of a stadium where there's fogmachines going off light lighting goingoff loud sounds uh you know things likeinformation all over the place I I loveit I love it and perhaps you might likesome certain aspects of it so this is aholographic fan from a company called UHol FX and I've got links to everythingin my bio guys so just go to my linktree if you're curious I I list it a lotthis is simply a mat a mat I found umonline for uh for for it's a it's alarge computer mouse and it's I liked itbecause the back is this rubbery feeland it doesn't move and it just createsthis awesome effect by the way this isconnected by Wi-Fi you can push whateverimages and logos you want I don't wantany hate from you guys I'm an Eagles fanum and it is what it is so they aredoing awesome this season by the way umanyway let me see where else I can gonext so this has swapped out and this isbig I won't talk about in the end NanoLeaf lighting guys uh the ticker is Bigtoo I'll get into that in a second theprojector is the same from 2020 end of2023 this is the awal vision LTV 3500Pro and um in my opinion an endgamelaser triple laser projector 3500 lumensit is incredible quality uh look at thislook at this thing and it's got cabinetspace you know you put a PS5 uh stufflike that in there I've got a lot offans and things running inside thisthing look here anyway let me zoom in alittle bit so it's a little brighter foryou guys so all my stuff is in there Iput a bunch of USB fans to keep it extracool and this is all power that's what'sreally really dramatic let me pause fora second and show you guys what it lookslike with the TVbehind all right so this is what itlooks like with the 75 in that I've hadfor a long time back here let me zoomout you guys get a a full-blown shothere um so zooming back in this is howawesome and Theatrical this is guys whenthis thing opens up so I have a smart uhroutine on my Harmony remote so I holdthis down for more than 2 seconds thenthis will open up and it is so dramaticnow look at this this is a power drawerthat's opening up you seethat I love freaking out my friends whenthey come over if they don't you knowbelieve it or not some of my friendsdon't even know I have a social mediathey're just like wow this is cool uhand anyway look how neat that is soit'll search for the signal and thenlook I got a I got a giant screen thatopened up on top and again this is anambient light rejecting screen this isthe whole this whole thing this entirecabinet is from awall vision and theythey sell this thing integrated you canyou can buy the uh the floor Risingscreen that fits perfectly in there aswell um and again this is an a ambientlight rejecting screen so lights fromthe top get rejected and and that's whythe contrast ratio looks so awesome andoften people just kind of assume thatthis is a giant TV when it's not and itreflects light from the bottom I'vetalked about it before you guys can seemy review videos on uh on the USprojectors that I've done uh uh quite abit of in the past so um I'll be doing alighting video soon guys you knowthere's certain tips and tricks thatI've got that a lot of people uh oftenask about that I haven't had a chance toshare but I will be sharing in thefuture so I hope you guys uh check thatvideo outas for uhtickers I've got long proper legittickers now and as you can see this is ascrolling ticker there's anotherscrolling ticker there this is fromglance LED this is hey look go follow meon on uh Instagram that just scrolled byuh these are awesome connected neverhave to pay for subscription this is aglance scrolling tickers this is theirtheir two 2 and 1/2t one and then

you'resitting here you know controlling thisyour entire field of view is taken up itit it puts a grin on my face from ear toear uh and then the other thing that youmay notice is right here these deviceslet me just go close instead of zoomingin uh so the I've got um a F fourspeakers and two subs this isalso from awal Vision the company thatmakes that um they make wirelesssurround sound systems those are twosubs that they they also provide in theBox it's called the product is calledthunderbeat it is pretty damn coolplaying immersive surround sound asyou're flying around and differentsounds are happening you know like AdobeAtmos effect with the speakers firing upit it is really really cool and allwirelessly done all I did was put thatdongle in that you see right there theyjust automatically sync and connect umhighly highly recommended if you'regetting that projector and then theawesome thing about that is this Centerthis has a a significant wattage speakerbuilt in and this ends up becoming acenter channel while this is yoursurround uh so so this is your frontright front left surround left uhsurround right and then your sub channelso that ends up AC acting as a centerchannel so you get your true uh5.1 but again there's two subs so 5.2really uh and this is also a go-kart sooften you know sometimes I uh my my myson will battle me in an F1 race forexample uh playing on this this is alsoa Next Level racing go-kart uh while Isit and play there in the same track Ium I turn on a I turn off a lot offeatures that are like the AI assist andstuff just so I don't have an unfairAdvantage um but uh yeah he often beatsme he's got better reflexes than I domaybe you should be a race car driver umso anyway moving on to the theater Iwon't talk about this as much because ithasn't CH like stuff that you see herehasn't changed a whole lot all myequipment rack stuff is all the same umyou know once again there's 11 speakersin here all AR rendle sound I've gotthree giant Towers behind this screen uhthat are uh this is an acousticallytransparent SC screen from Elon Vision Idid upgrade my projector to a laser thatis the BenQ W5 5800 highly recommendedcheck out my review video on that fromearlier from mid 2024 a fantastic laserprojector and the image and thebrightness is is just incredible as youguys can see you know just beautifulbeautiful image that it and and the popand color brightness the accuracyabsolutely fantastic anyway anothermajor upgrade that I walked right by asI don't know if you guys noticed in someof my previous videos lighting umlighting control specifically so as youcan see I used to have some shuttersthere for all the giant Windows you knowit is Subterranean I don't want to feeldepressed and be in the basement all thetime right right so uh I can uh I havethe these smart connected blinds now soif I say turn the game room on uh allthese blinds will typically close aseverything turns on assuming that I'mtypically watching at night but if Iwant to open the blinds you know they'resmart connected I can just say turn theopen the blinds uh but you know I canalso do it manually you know with aremote as you can see and it changes thevibe completely you know you get abright sunny day and look how look howmore inviting it became and a goodconsequence this is again a greatdemonstration of ambient light rejectingscreens this is that awall Vision againlook at this light hitting here and it'seating itup it looks just as awesome you knowsure you get a little bit of a contrasthit on certain sides but a perfectlywatchable absolutely giant screen andagain the vibe changes and also the vibechanges when I sayturn the main pot lightson so you guys will see in a second allthese lights will start changing to runas regular pot lights you seethis all of these just switch backup and that one some of them take longerthan than others but you can see thatthey're switching back up to run asregular pot lights which is a prettycool effect by the way the these I kindof left so that they don't ras uh as brightly just because thescreen is over there but the vibe of theroom has completely changed because Idon't want it dark with you know the biguh LED lights all over the place allthe time but again look at that giantscreen and it still displays beautifullywith all the lights on switched back toregular regular lighting with with theblinds open with direct with pretty muchdirect sunlight comingthrough okay maybe I'll leave it likethis this bright but maybe you guys cancomment in the comments here like youknow do you do you like the look of thethe lights all you know basically inambient mode where it was doing thatEclipse halo effect and or like thiswith the blinds open and bright and uhmore I feel that it's a little bit moreclinical this way but you know sometimesI like changing things up so anyway thispart let me just talk about what plans Ihave for uh 2025 it isonly January 4th I think and U I'll begoing to CES by the way so go once againgo check out my Instagram I'll besharing a whole lot of stories of newtech that's coming out it's the world'slargest electronic show that happens inVegas every year um and I'll have uhI'll have a lot to share from there soso what I plan on doing this year um Idon't have huge plans to change upanything heredrastically maybe and it's a long shotthese might get swapped out withsomething else um but uh more to come onthat by the way I am building ChrisBrown's man cave right now um it's goingto be absolutely freaking epic so watchfor that video to drop at some point inFebruary or March I've I've uh been overto this place about four or five timesawesome dude uh it's going to be prettyincredible I'm going to be doing severalother celebrities this year hopefully somake sure you guys uh check out mycontent um and follow me on on inespecially on Instagram just for thataspect of it uh cuz it'll be reallyinteresting some NBA players and someNFL players some big time ones too thatactually follow me there it's prettyhumbling guys it's just my socialmedia's really exploded over there anduh I want to I want to feed it with somethings every so often um so the bigthing that I'm really looking forward toand hopefully it happens and it's a highpriority is I've already got uh Basshakers in this thing so that you knowyou feel the rumbles of the road and theengine and stuff there's a so trackracer has uh that uh um uh Shaker thereand then there's one underneath the seatbut what I really really want is motionI want to be ableto as I'm driving feeling the G's as thewhole thing turns so hopefully a deboxbased motion system uh will be availableon this and then this while I'm talkingabout that the second thing would be Iam likely going to replacethis right here this go-kart we probablygo upstairs you maybe my son's room orsomething um I want a drift rig you knowthe drift rigs with the the differentwheels and sequential shift as well Iwant that um so hopefully that'll happenthis yearthat would be the next uh major thingand in the theater there may be somechanges again because I usually uh Iusually change up the projector veryvery often you know the rest of the techthe screen and and other things don'treally change all that much but I I willlikely end up changing the projector sostay tuned I you know I usually havesome some coolrecommendations and uh I'll be sharingthat uh uh very very soon and while I'min the game room my friends at AVStyles they will likely be here at somepoint and awesome guys guys uh checkthem out on uh Instagram as well um I'vealways been eyeing a starry ceiling andI will likely finally get that done inthe theater room you know to create thateffect of it's basically fiber opticswith like a shooting star going and justthat little twinkle that you see um youknow if you've seen any videos of thosehigh-end Rolls-Royce cars you theceiling liner that they've got that kindof thing so that is going to be prettydamn awesome um I know I'm all over theplace guys but you know I get I stillget a whole lot of questions on this Ido intend on doing a more dedicatedvideo explaining this in a lot moredetail my digital signage how I controlit and all of that but in the meantimejust do check out that ticker videocheck out my Jumbotron video and becausethat shows you a lot of my automationthe rest is just really formatting andcontrol like you know keep keep in mindguys like you know I show everything offin one big shot and everyone just kindof assumes like oh my God I can't dothis or you get overwhelmed um you knowyou're going to take SE sections piecesof this and apply it to your own spacesand that's what the intention of mysocial media is guys like that's where Ifind the most Joy um is when peoplerespond like hey I didn't know I coulddo this hey awesome ideas uh I'm goingto take this and then I and then I seeit implemented by thousands of peopleout there and that's where I feelhumbled like wow this is this is awesomeyou know people have taken some of myideas and you do it if you do DIY it'sthat mucheasier um cost-wise it's Le less costagain digital signage is still thenumber one thing that draws a lot ofpeople uh into my social mediaso anyway I'll show you guys upstairsvery very briefly let me get get upthere right now okay I just told thefamily to stay kind of quiet cuz I'mrecordingaudio anyway I'm going upstairs guys sohere's what the entrance looks like letme turn back around I did add anotherticker there cuz you know it's just thethe craziness I just wanted to make itinviting as you come downstairs that heythis is the approach some movie postersuh and uh um if you guys remember in anolder video I shared if I'm playinganything in the movie theater it'lldisplay the poster and the runtime ofwhat's playing in the theaterautomatically and you can check out thevideo on how I did that so that tickeragain is the scrolling ticker from uhglance LED and I actually put a SmartLock here as well a thumb print readerit's just kind of more theatrical thananything but let's go back into myoffice and I'll just briefly talk aboutthis it hasn't changed a whole lot it'sjust you know some of the stuff that Iran out of room for the arcades ofarcade one-ups have made it up here andI'm probably going to be selling a wholebunch of these cuz I want to change thisspace up to be different a bit classierand um you know as you can see the thethe other pinball from at games is nowdown there I brought my Star Wars upupstairs heavily modified as well but uhmore to come in 2025 going to changethat space up quite a bitall right back downstairs soaesthetically I mean as you guys cantell there's not going to be hugechanges but you know some thingssometimes some things happen verysporadically as my mind's always activeI enjoy the journey rather than thedestination so you know for me it's likeI I I'm pretty grateful to God for allthat I have but at the same time for methe enjoyment is actually in like youknow I'll sit here and be like wow thisis freaking cool and then uh and then belike okay now what so that's where myendorphin release is I have to be inmotion I can't sit still too long andthat's why this place will continue tochange up I have no idea what else 2025will bring but it you can guaranteethings will be changing here and I'll besharing my best practices be you knowbest bang for the buck I want to do somevideos where you know there's a tieredapproach uh you know if you're if you'rejust starting off and you got a budgetof less than 10 grand what you can whatcan what you can do under 5 grand whatyou can do under 50 Grand 100 Grand 200Grand or sky the limit what I would doso I I want to make some video contentuh uh on that as well by the way I keptwalking by this darn thing this thing isfreaking awesome so I got chewed out inmy in my uh comments forever for yearsthat people would often comment that youknow everything's awesome but why doesthis guy have like a$50 um uh golf mat that's that's rolledout so you know I finally replaced itwith something that is much much nicer Ihave a link to it in my bio you knowthis just got this grass feel even ifyou don't play it look how freakinggorgeous this thing looks look at it youknow when people come over you know Ihave these in there now I like lookingat it but these are off and out cuz youknow kids are running around I don'twant this stuff breaking either sothat'll get uh uh that'll get put awaybut anyway guys I hope you enjoyed thisvideo I know it's been long in Ramblingum let

I wish my house had a basement
Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven. Can I so come over? I'll bring the beer and pizza. Sure I live in Australia, but I'm on the next plane out. Freaking awesome setup my new friend
youre really living the dream. mancaves like this are what inspire me to keep mine fresh and clean.
i will have a cave like this one day videos like this give me inspiration and motivation cuz this is the goal im doing all the hard work for
Man, you've outdone yourself. This is by far the best setup I've seen. Kudos!
Love your setup tours. Everything looks great! If I ever strike it rich I want to hire you to make my dream mancave!
Amazing as always!!!!
Your wire management is out of this world
Love you're videos and how you present you're ""projekt basement"" gives a lot of inspiration for everyone no matter the budget ️
You have absolutely ZERO competition for “Gameroom/Man-Cave/Everything-In-One” Room of the Forever!! Damn
best mancave i've ever seen.
Awesome tour as always! Great video
Wow!! Couldn't imagine the cost of all this. Looks amazing bro.
Love the way when blinds open and white lighting so cool .great set up
I wish I could live in a house like yours
Man, you've got Outrun, that's an awesome game!! You just need to add Wrestlefest in there and Simpsons Arcade (the rare Beavis and Butt-Head arcade machine would be awesome) but this is a fantastic setup.

Congrats on all your hard work, you've done a wonderful job!!
This looks so dope!! I love your setup tours. Everything looks great! If I was rich I'd definitely hire you to make my dream mancave!
For the BLACK Piano finish on your seats, get them VINYL WRAPPED the same color and then you don't have to worry about them getting scratched
Awesome video. Love the home theater and the big screens with the theater seats.
Always loving your theatre looking forward to CES.
What a crazy basement! I want one too!
Nothing to see here just a pair of Virgil Abloh LV air forces sitting on a claw machine!!!!!!! No big flex dude I'm watching in amazement then what !!!!!!! That's crazy boss !
Love it...Nice!
Amazing
Looks awesome
That is a beautiful setup.
This is so cool, man. Totally relate to the feeling of having to remain in motion and enjoy the journey even more than the destination. But don’t forget to really take the time to enjoy it with your friends and family. Now what ?
Love the natural light part of the video. If you’re ever in Michigan, stop by and give me some tips. LOL!
Go Birds!!!
If you have a fibrenew in your area they could color match and repair the leather marks
I don’t care how many times you said it and I watched it! I want to hear everything again!


Some of us have ADHD
Good work brother
The Eagles did alright this year
Thanks
Yooo! I just subscribed
knows the lightbill is through the roof AKA not cheap lol.Awsome job with the setup man you severve it hard work pays off!
The electric bill must be massive!
Need that digital signage video ASAP brother! Set up looks clean AF
Nice. Halfway makes me wanna post my setups. I'm pretty extreme but not anywhere near this level haha
VERY NICE ROOM!
if i had a place like this, i would not let anyone stay in there for longer than 2 minutes. They definitely would not be able to touch anything.
What a Dream. This feels so official auf legit . Great Work. Please consider to answer my question. There are two smaller screens on the wall right to the big screen showing rising bubbles in a circle . Is this wallpaper available on youtube? Find it so appealing especially in your room. Thanks
Did I spy a Louis Vuitton Air Force 1? We need to see a sneaker collection now!
I have been using your setup as one of my main inspirations for my own fan cave. I have a smaller space, but I'm using some of the same ideas. The thing is, I love a bunch of teams (Sens, Leafs, Jays, Vikings, Raptors and Celtics) in different sports, and I want the zone to convert totally to feel like a true fan zone for each of those teams when they are playing. So I've got a bunch of screens (8 small screens in addition to my main central display). It's easier to convert images on screens than to swap out physical objects -- and cheaper too. By combining that with the Nanoleaf lighting with different team themes, plus just a few physical items (like team logo cushions) that I can bring out before a given team is playing, it's starting to feel like I have 6 fan caves rather than one. Plus I can't wait for the next F1 season! Not done yet... just putting on some of the finishing touches... but I just wanted to thank you for some of the ideas (especially the main principle that your fan cave can have many 'faces'/themes to it. But when it's quiet and no games are one, my Sens are always the true #1 in my fan zone! PS- Sadly, my first true fan zone game I watched with my new setup was last night's Vikings/Lions game -- apparently my dedicated fanship didn't help secure top seed for Minnesota!!
nice
Go birds!!!
what a stunning basement masallah
Great content once again there mate. When you showed the golf flags at the end how you don’t want them broken by the kids have you considered using magnets on the flags so they will just fall over and not break? Just an idea… Look forward to the next one ️
Got to try and get LTT to see this room. They would love it.
How much was all of this?! What job do I need to do to get this in my house
go birds!
GO BIRDS!!!!
You have done an incredibly good job with that game room,,,,,when's then next B.Y.O.B ? #Aztec73
Would you consider a Valerion Max for a lifestyle projector in your future upgrades? The
EBL, vertical lens shift & dynamic iris are really something. Maybe the AWOL USTD pro's will have that feature on the next line.The projector is slated for May 2025 release.
This is insane I’ve followed you on Instagram for a long time but never watched a full walkthrough of yours on YouTube. Crazy setup. I’m looking at getting an UST projector very soon is there anything to look out for or buying tips you could give me? Wanting to run a fixed 120 inch ALR screen. I’ll be watching movies on it but also I do a lot of gaming. Thanks dude!
Thank you for sharing your update! What brand/model are the ceiling pot lights?
Obsessed with your space. Which model ticker do you have above your main screen? Is it Glance or skybox? The quality is great, kind of looks like the one you made, only with the ""ticker"" feature.
Random/stupid request - if you come across a smart dog/pet door at CES could you post that to your social? Pawport was shown there last year but it’s been CRICKETS since from the company
What do you do for work???
How can you call this a man cave without a nice indoor golf simulator
Do you have a detailed walkthrough video for your digital signage?
The coffee table is also a fridge no?
When are you going to do a garage update on your garage
GO BIRDS!!!
Where did you get that coffee table
Hey man - where did you get the long scrolling ticker you have mounted above the TV at 8:32?
Hey did you say digital sinage far as the two pink and blue led signs
What’s your ceiling height. I’ve been thinking about getting a Vividstorm floor rising projector and I’m at 7 feet.
Awesome Content and showcasing this Mancave! Also, we sent you an email about our cool mounts perfect for any mancave setup, love for you to check it out when you get a chance. Keep up the great content!James
Now add a real pinball machine. You got this
Hey! Can you please tell me what size is this space including home theatre ?
I know your electric bill is wild if you’re not on solar.
You got rid of the table tennis table and some of your Arcade1Ups.
Is the ticker above the TV a Glance Scroll Pro also or something else?
Awesome basement
I had to put my Gameroom in the upstairs loft, Is this a basement? Do you live up north cause we don’t have basements in Florida
FlyEaglesFly
I can’t seem to find your link for the pot lights?
Mom can we go over uncle house please mom please
What size is your basement
Wait, just to clarify, you're talking about Chris Brown the Canadian musician, and not Chris Brown the guy who assaulted Rhianna, correct? I got really confused at first.
Really nice setup building a home now sorry I got you banned on neogaf
I know it might look weird at first but for the two chairs on the wall
By the tv . You should angle the chairs at like 20-30 degree angle so they can view it better.
Shame movkng kart rig if your son loves playing against you
All I gotta say is can I have some money please
Must be nice to be rich...

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Looks AMAZING DUDE !
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
I remember doing this for my room when I was getting my first gaming pc last year. I was suppose to only paint the corner of my room and then I ended up doing my whole room over and changing pretty much everything it was an amazing feeling when it came together.
I just revamped my room so this was pretty inspiring to add a couple more things in, loved it!
the pace of your storytelling is wonderful - not too slow to become boring but also not too fast to feel rush. I literally feel like Im actually living with you. You have a new subscriber here, thank you for making this vid
your video really motivates many people to re decor their rooms, as a full time college student and job, a side with streaming, i need to make my Room as Aesthetic as your room is now !
if i may give some more suggestions:
id recommend putting a curtain in front of your closet. it really blocks off the clutter plus i think a black curtain would look beautiful

i would personally also clean up the shelf above your setup a bit. there is a TON of stuff on it and the colors really clash agains the cozy vibe with your room. so if i were you id pick a few things i really like and put them on there, and the others somewhere else :D

overal, awesome video! i envy you!
The wood with the black was an AMAZING choice. I saw it before you even brought it up and went ""oooooooh thats gonna look good""
Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
That xenohunter knife is sick man (also your room)
this was a crazy transformation, you look MAD different since the last time we interacting and i'm glad to see you slowly killing the tech game. KEEP THIS SHIT UP
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
Im moving out soon and have been looking for room inspo. This gave me a clear idea of what I want my room to look like. Thanks a lot man
!!
Great video!!! stumbled upon it in my feed
Personally am a white/green with wood accents type of guy but I dig your overall update!
Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!
not gonna lie ... this turn out sick ... the way you turn this small room is so awesome... lot of love.
As many people are saying, the quality of this video and the editing are expected of a large channel! Keep at it, this was great!
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!
Love how dude just clipped his mic to his glasses
This video deserves a million views.
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
I’m so close to getting my dream setup I’ve been saving for a while now and have about 200$ I need way more but these type of videos inspire to keep saving up you’ve gained a new subscriber
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
don't remove the paper/seal on the PC with the PC on sometimes if its sealed to much it will cause static and maybe mess up ur pc for a bit but DW its ez to fix
man you deserve more subs, more views, more everything. You're a great youtuber and the fact you spent this much with only a small amount of subs has gotten you my respect.
How do you only have 11k man!?! Love the video and the whole design you went with, it's phenomenal! I eventually want to revamp my entire room and try and stream and make videos again!
first time watching you, and i have never ever stayed seated at my setup for that long just for a youtube video, keep it up man (great job with the editing)
Honestly, there isn't a lot of people make setup videos anymore and this was nice to see. Really great video and I'm definitely hitting that subscribe button. Keep up the great work!!! Sick setup!
this is amazing. You really did achieve a dream setup
Great Video! Loved the aesthetic. One small suggestion to get a black curtain to hide your closet + also keep dust and sunlight off your clothes.
I didn't expect this kind of quality from a channel with only 11k subs, great job bro keep it up!!
love the style you went for, amazing setup bro!
Loving the nice clean aesthetic of the room, and also the high end quality of the video itself. Seriously deserving of more attention. Keep up the great work man, you're doing an incredible job.
I'm yapping too much (12:30) is the most accurate statement ever!!
That wall with the black paint, the lights and the plant instantly improved the room, proper class! (Just needs to be not hidden by the bed! ) 2 mattresses though! I did that years ago and found it made my back worse! One of them was a cheapo one though, also do you notice much light coming through the canisteo window blinds? Look like they aren't flush to the sides if that makes sense?

Great set up BTW, room looks so much better after changing the decor!
It's always a treat finding Habesha YouTubers. Love ur vids gang
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
0:19 Not trying to be offensive or disrespectful, but low-key reminded me of Cookie from, ""Ned's Declassified. Which is an awesome character that brings charm to the group, which is my favorite when waiting for each episode.
room turned out dope!
love it dude! Im on my room revamping journey now as well. This helps a lot!
Boy 10/10 room bro you nailed it
this style IS the new ""rgb"" style
You just got another sub bro! Love the raw and genuine content.
setup looks crazyyy
I’m new to the channel and I can already tell you got potential. It was such a chill video I genuinely enjoyed it. And the end product Keep up the good work

Why do you have a map of myhouse and the appraisal value from theassessor's website? But to make thishappen, we need a three-step plan.First, we have to shop for a one-startag.

Don't worry, this one may not havethe gaming theme that we were lookingfor, but it is a ergonomic standingdesk. This is the 1/2 pieces 55 inelectronic standing desk coming in witha one-star review. Never got the packageand they refused to give me a refund.Starting to see a common theme here. I'mgetting a little nervous, but we'readding the cart. 73% off. But what I maybe most excited about is what kind ofgaming chair can we get off the world oftame. Oh, here it is. Heavyduty 400 lb.So, we can barely fit on this thing. RGBLED gaming chair. This is 400 lb. No,no, no. Before you assemble this item,make sure that the parts are complete,especially the remote. Little confusedat the English comprehension on thatone. I don't know. That screams youraesthetic. everything I've gleaned aboutyour personality. Add to cart. To holdit all down, we got the most importantpart of our entire setup, the gaming PC.Gosh dang it. We have had such a hardtime finding one-star products off ofTeimu, except when it comes to ourgaming PC, which is probably the mostimportant centerpiece in the entiregaming setup. We got the STG Aubrongaming desktop PC. It's coming in with aRadeon RX 580, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM, 1 TBSSD, and some RGB fans. One star. Thereview shipping was very fast, but is aChristmas present, so I will updatereview when I hook it up. Comma. Videocard don't work. Not cool. When aChristmas gift does not work, that'swhat you get for buying your PC off ofTeeu. Add to cart. After finalizing ourPC setup items, we might as well go allin with our looks and decoration. I'vebeen hearing about these mystery boxesoff a team. It is $8.68 saying ultimatesurprise gift over 30 fun and uniqueitems to choose from. But when I go downto the one-star reviews, I'm I'm sensinga common theme here. I got a cheap watchand a flashlight. I end up receiving 99cent storewatch and a $2 flashlight. Imean, with this mystery box, I hope I'mnot getting a cheap watch and aflashlight, which came out to a total of$960. But did everything get delivered?Well, that brings us to step two.unboxing what is hopefully all of ourtech. Well, boys, our massive Teimudelivery is now here. But I have somegood news. And I have some bad news. Asyou can see, we have most of our gamingsetup delivered. The bad news is we aremissing our speakers, RGB clouds, andour mouse pad. It said it was supposedto be here 4 days ago. Our gaming setupmay be a little lacking. You're gettingscammed. Too's not a scam. And just toremind you guys, not only did we get onestar reviewed gaming setup products, butwe also did get one star reviewed mints.Wow,that's so minty. It's only 40 millig, soit's like half a cup of coffee.Before we could even unbox anything, wealready ran into our first red flag. Amap of my house. That is crazy. I stilldon't understand why you're pulling upthe appraisal amount on my home and thenputting it on the box. I think they'rein my walls. Honestly, I respect thededication, Timu, but that won't stop usfrom unboxing our first item, our 55-instanding desk. What is that sturdy? Now,off the bat, this desk is looking alittle off. Supposedly, this can hold154 lbs, but I'm scared to even put agaming setup on this. I have a meetingtomorrow morning at 9:00. Do you thinkyou could have that one finished up bythen? This screw? Yeah, I think so.So, the onestar review, the good thingisthey never got the package and theyrefused to give the refund. The goodnews is we did get the package. The badnews is that color looks a little bitdifferent than this, wouldn't you say?Like, look at that. It's like a lightwood. We got to plug it in to see if itactually works and goes up and down. Allright. Does it ascend?Hey, hooray.Now the question is how much weight.That motor definitely slowed down. Turnsout this thing actually works prettysolid for 100 bucks. But now it's timeto get into the fun stuff. Wait, so ifthat was the desk and this is the gamingchair, what is in this big one? It's ourmystery box. And it's very, verydelicate and it's important we're savingit towards the end. So, first up, wehave our computer monitor from, pardonmy French here, go folk. We are comingin with 27 in, get this, super monitor.Don't quite know what a super monitoris. We got our monitor stand. Ooh, I gotto say, they gave me a display portinstead of HDMI. And the best is yet tocome, boys.Ready? So, we got a 27 in, but it is acurved monitor. On the bottom, we dohave an HDMI, you got a display port,you got USB, and of course, your power.The last thing we need to do is then putthis on itsstand. Have you seen the screw for thisthing? But Joel, we got to give thepeople what theywant. How is that for anASMR? This is a dynamic stand, you know.Yeah, it's great angles. But how doesthis monitor compare to the review sofar? Very bad return process and verybad customer service. Again, thatdoesn't really tell me how the monitorworks, but we're about to find out. Oh,is that the screw? Found the screw. Wegot the Vaude Durk GT100 Luminous RGBkeyboard and mouse. But let's go aheadand open this. The the box seems to haveseen better days. Now, I'm a littleworried because again, my boy Deborahover there said this arrived broken andin pieces. I hate to break it to you,Deborah, but my keyboard did not come inpieces. Yeah, this is going to be alittle rough. I mean, for 15 bucks, whatcan you expect? Except it even has aspring in the keyboard. I don't thinkI've ever seen that. Of course, youalways have your switch behind it, butan actual spring. But mouse. Oh,sorry. Little rough on the clicks. Butthe one thing that I'm a littledisappointed about is all my gaming micehave the two buttons here on the sidethat I use for like back and forwardwhen I'm scrolling the worldwide web.And this one does not have that. So,we're limited to a left click, rightclick, and the scroll wheel. But again,for 15 bucks, I mean, how much more canyou ask for? All right, boys. And thethird one, hold on. All right, boys. Andfor the third one, we have get this bigand tall gaming chair, which I mean,honestly, between us is perfect.Now, I will say I don't think I've everhad a gaming chair with RGB. Oh my gosh,dude. I forgot we did the pink one. Ohmy gosh, dude.Ho. Good boy. Ho free dog. Does thisthing have speakers on it? Why are theyfacing away from you and not where you'dbe sitting? It's called surround sound,Quinn. Oh, I'm sorry. But this issupposed to be new, boys. I have somedirt marks already on the chair.Ah, yeah. Like your normal gaming chairslike the Secret Labs and stuff likethat, you're going to be paying $400 to$500. But for 150 bucks, you're gettingsurround sound, RGB, and slightly used.Great. Now, much to my surprise, thisgaming chair has some pretty specialfeatures. You can't tell me. Holdon. Why is it Why is it all scuffed upalready? Why is it bros never satbefore? Oh, found it. Wow. I mean, howdoes the stability on the leg thinglook? Cuz it feels like when I put mylegs on it that it's going to snap. Butafter piecing together most of oursetup, it's time to plug in the mostvaluable piece of tech of them all.Normally PCs are a little more densethan this. We say one thing. We orderoff a team for a reason. Okay. Beingmade in Canada, isn't it? Okay. If wejust remember, we weren't going to getspeakers, mouse pad, and RGB cloud. AndI did not know this, but they didinclude a mouse pad with the PC. Dude,we even got a mouse in that looks eerilysimilar to each other. Which one'scooler? The white and blackone. What? Well, here is the main event.It's so small. Our boy here said heordered a Christmas present and hisChristmas kit no longer works. And Ithink it was the graphics card, but 9600GPU, 16 gigs of RAM. Oh my god, thislooks like a toy. Two RGB fans righthere. Another RGB fan, two RGB fans uphere. Dude, look at this thing. What isthis piece of RAM from my miscellaneousPC parts that I will eventually use.This is what RAM here in the UnitedStates looks like. This is the RAM wegot off of T-Moon. We are getting 16gigs. I'm going to have to go doublecheck our screenshots. I know this isthe real moment of truth and what youguys are herefor. Look at that. I mean, I bet he hasjust like great personality. I mean, helooks cute. I want to give you guys aquick comparison of PCs. Okay, look atthat thing. That's like Don't talk to meor my son ever again. Now, before weturn the entire PC setup on, it is themoment of truth. Now, if you guysremember, we end up finishing off theordering segment with a mystery gift. Imean, we could be getting a watch, aflashlight, or maybe mean even a PS5. Weneed to see what we ended up getting.This is the mystery box. Wow. That isquite some shipping. Are you serious?This is it, boys. What did they say?There was a bunch of reviews. It waseither a flashlight or a watch. What arewe hoping for? I mean, a flashlightwould be sick.Ooh, suck. 401.This is definitely not worth the onestarreview. Dude, look at that thing. Andit's got, I'm guessing, 400 games builtinto one. So, we're going to be pluggingthis in. We're going to be giving it agood charge and see what games are onit. Dude, that's a little overkill for abox for that thing. Yeah, dude. Now,this may be the kicker that seals thisentire setup off.No, we're running with that. Oh, doesthis a smell? Oh my gosh. But this issupposed to be 50 ft of RGB that we'regoing to use in our setup. Now, you maybe looking at the setup right nowsaying, ""There's not 50 ft worth of RGBin there."" Oh, yes, there is. Four bucksis not bad. But we haven't turned it onyet, so I better not speak. Now that wehave finished steps one and two, it isnow time for the most important part ofthe build, which is step three, testingit all out. It's the moment of truth.Whoa. Why is it vibrating?Okay. Honestly, I'm impressed that firstof all, the chair turned out and secondof all, the PC turned on. Exciting. Oh,no. Wait, the rope light. This ropelight. It was going to look so aestheticand not like a crime scene at all. Oh,wait. Why are they on the same remote?Oh, the PC and the chair controllingboth at once. I click red and thatchanges to green. I go green, thatchanges to purple. Question is, do Iwant this PC to be able to connect to myWi-Fi? I mean, they already know youraddress. That's true. They know myappraisal value on my house, so whatmore do they need? We got the PC on.Thankfully, I did not see this. Italready comes with Windows alreadydownloaded. So, all I had to do is enterall my personal information, socialsecurity number, credit card info. Forsome reason, they wanted my mother'smaiden name. But now that we goteverything downloaded, what we're goingto be doing is going on the worldwideweb with Wow, what is the sensitivity onthis thing? And we're going to bedownloading some Marvel rivals to seehow this thing holds up,bro. It's actually kind of loud. Now,Marvel Rivals has taken years todownload, so we're testing a differenthighmaintenance game on this PC for thetime being. Dude, I'm going for thatequalizer. says I'm 38th right now.Yeah, right. Wow, you're just belowQuebec.Oh, well, that game lasted about 32seconds. Now, I know it's been weighingon you guys' mind since we've beendownloading Marvel Rivals. How is thesub 400 games in one doing? Andhonestly, was there a power button? No.Oh, we want to go for English, right?Oh, yeah. So, you have everything fromSuper Mario, Mario 14, Mario 13, Dr.Mario, Mario Bros., Turtles. You haveDonkey Kong 1, 2, and 3 and Junior.My gosh.Gosh. Good game. For what was this? $8for a mystery thing. Yeah. Everyone wasupset because all they advertised wastechnology. Tech Game Boy games. Andeveryone was getting a watch and aflashlight. Like a $2. Exactly. Thisthing might be the biggest steal of ourordering, but it's Marvel Rivals time.Let's go. My favorite part is how thescreen keeps going black.Like that. Yeah. Oh my gosh, dude. It'sfrozen.Oh my god. Connected. Oh yeah. Oh.Oh my gosh. It's so loud. Oh my gosh.Punisher is on nothing right now. Yeah,he is. He's just chilling there, youknow. We are getting 70 to 80 fps on a1080p monitor. And again, this is out ofgame. Now we've dropped down to like 6465ish in game. So even with this monitorat 180 Hz refresh rate, you can't evenuse that to the full capabilities cuzyou're maxed out at 60. But let's seewhat actually happens when you get likeinto a battle scene. Yeah, that workedout well. 48 FPS. It's great. How's thekeyboard and mouse hold? Um it's alittle slippery without something, youknow? I'm just so glad that I get tolisten to the game through my chair.That's probably my favorite part.Temperature on the PC is still good.Like fans are keeping this nice and cooleven though the PC is struggling.There's a little heat on the top, so Ifigured that's where the exhaust fansare. Standing, sitting, pink chair,speakers, doesn't matter. I can tellyour mouse is getting stuck a lot. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But at the end of theday, is the Teimue Tech here reallyworth the onestar review? All right.Rapid fire review. Chair, I'm going togive this a four out of five. It wasgoing to be a three out of five, butjust because they put in a massagingback rest, we're going to give them afour out of five. So, we got to givethem that extra star. Mouse andkeyboard. I got to give that like 1.5out of five. Now, I know both of thesecombined was only $15, but they werevery, very difficult to use. Now,monitor overall, actually, this is goingto be quite a steal. I got to give this4.5 out of five on the stars. It wouldhave gotten a 10. I just couldn't findthe screw in the beginning, and that'sdefinitely not my fault. Now, when itcomes to the desk, the desk overall, Imean, for a little over 100 bucks, I'mgoing to give this one a 3.5 out offive. I don't like the dividing naturedown the middle right there. If theywould have sealed that, it would havebeen like a 4.5 out of five. What couldyou ask for for you know a little over100 bucks? Now the PC. Why are youtouching it like that? Okay, dude.Honestly, I'm going to give this afourst star rating out of five. Now, Iknow it struggled on Marvel Rivals alittle bit and a Gario. And a Gario. Butwhen you think of a $400 PC that alsocomes with a mouse, keyboard, and mousepad, may I let you know? You're probablyunder $400 for this PC. And still to beable to play Marvel Rivals on that, Imean, that's pretty killer. Now, would Iuse something like this PC? No, Iwouldn't. So, the Teimu setup was goodoverall, but if you want to see what asetup like this looks like from Walmart,you can check that video out here. So, Iappreciate you guys, and we'll see youon the next one.[Music]","10:40 2 RAM sticks are identical if you remove the heatsink
Nah my broke ass would be using this setup
Two things I saw. The monitor was 100Hz refresh rate yet you received a 180Hz, and the GPU stated it was an RX580 16GB. There is no such thing as a RX580 with 16GB. They were made with only 4GB or 8GB configurations. Great video! Enjoyed it!
The ram was funny cause I bet that the big white corsair is just the same stick as the other. They made them taller to make it easier to sit in smaller boards now that pcs are very tight and no longer huge.
That huge box for that little 400 in 1
A temu ad just popped up
Don’t talk to me or my son ever again got me rolling 11:02
“It’s called surround sound quin.” Best line in the vid.
10:55, you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
4:20 I thought the desk wasn’t gonna show but hey I was wrong it showed up
The turning on the pc part scared me lol
That's actually not bad
The screen suddenly turning off while playing a game is simply caused by the keyboard you bought. My friend has the same problem. The same thing happens to him. If you change the keyboard, this problem will not occur.Good video i enjoyed that
It's been a pretty long time since I last watched your videos. You're so underrated, the video quality is so good for someone with 131k subs
i sold DDR 3 monster with 16GB, ASUS 970 pro gaming AURA, SSD and RX 580 for only 200$ last year
Yo I thought this video had like 24k likes, heavily underrated video
bro yoi look like the lost brother of Vitaly.
I say this with all my sincerity, you have a very good YouTube channel
Better than my 500 dollar aliexpress pc (ryzen 5 5600x, 32gb ram, GT 1030)
It looks like this temu set up looks better than my set up ️
At least the monitor has the ""Tilt function for smooth gaming"". Because we all know not being able to tilt your monitor is almost always the cause of latency and stutters in games.
9:45 did you just use a GPU to open the box LOL
Can u show us the true specs of the pc when u got it please ?
If you don’t want it I would lovely take it to start with my gaming channel
oohhh, mystery boxes...*breaks out my shovel and digs my grave* Remember, pink is the new blue...
You need to lower the monitors refresh rate for it to stop going black
Wait is that the guy who does backflips
The screen going black issue could be because of a very cheap display port cable. I bought a cheap one once and this is exactly what happened, it even caused my PC to crash
First time seeing your video, instantly subscribed. The review was so damn put together and y'all were so funny 
Highly underrated
that case is kind of nice and small footprint
i started watching your video, and temu ad popped up
I don’t know if u have a 5 stars build from temu, but I want to see it
Very underrated
8:17 GAMING CHIAR
Call me crazy but that leg-rest on the chair might actually come in handy if used by a small kid who cant reach the floor.
i like when he said his favourite mouse is the black and white one
Wait zealouss best friend?
Buyer : bad product, doesn't even turn on 
Him : add to cart
can bet mine is worse
6:18 I see what you did there “gofawk yourself 🫵”
Mann!! I Love it when He do that funny pose 4:25
Anyone notice how all the options say local due to the tariffs temu had now gone down the drain
Came out of nowhere with high quality video damn
14:29 I HAVE THIS
The desk was a 2 star review from a 1 star seller.
In our region ALL Temu listings have 5 Star and great reviews like it is fake for all products,
Good to know in other region there is honest rated products of temu
I really need something like this atleast for now
Would you mind Please give me your personal computer because I need it for my studies.
I hope their slogan is: Gawfalk yourself!
The moment bro gave that reaction with that ram I instantly knew he does not know a lot about pcs. Those who know knows what I'm talking about
11:43 wait a minute I have the exact same one but yellow, got it a gift from my grandma
Marvel rival's could have ran better if the ram was upgraded to dual channel
6:29 asus monitors include dvi also. Who use dvi anyway
nice vid ! btw u say 60 fps is pretty good while im playing roblox with everything off on 50 fps ;-;
I just subscribed. And This was well edited, and made me laugh
This channel is underrated!
That chair is shockingly cute
$400 for a PC with a RX 480 is quite pricey. :)
They probably sell those cards for $50 on eBay second hand, which is without a doubt where it came from lol.
Ihave the same system unit
Your gaming setup is better than mine,oww i forgot i don't have one
That temu pc is far better than ma core i5 from 2012 3rd gen nice video btw
Did my guy really just open the pc box with a gpu lmao
Ngl I would take that set up like it's my dream set up better than my phone
This is the highend pc in our country
Yeh
Sadly temu dont have pcs in my country.
I wanted to see what PCs they have xD
Did TEMU got sponsor all of this just for a video? That would be more interesting to know about it.
More temu pls but with good stuff like good quality stuff. Like good keybord and mouse
For 1000$ on Temu you can buy PC on Threadripper 7995WX and 4 RTX 5090.
Can I have that?
Albino u on Crack for buying this 1 star junk
Bro used the GPU to open the box
why you unboxed it with a grafiks card
can i have that pc?
Try 1000$ microcenter
I love you guys
Need the link for gaming table
This is peak PC
bro, just give me that graphics card instead of turning it into a boxcutter HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Gaming chair is crazy lil bros
I think why is the PC is not working is because it’s from another country and the electricity is way more powerful than the United States

Our first upgrade is adesk. This one is called Atlas Light.Absolutely fantastic looking piece whichguys from Blacklight have sent us forthis project. It comes in threedifferent colors and four sizes. We wentwith an extra-L large natural oak andtrust me, you can feel the quality of itjust from its weight. It took us like 20minutes to assemble and this thing issuper sturdy.It comes with dual motors and fourdifferent height settings. Here we areperforming a simple stability test andit passed it with flying colors.Is it stable?Stable.There is also a built-in cablemanagement tray, but we will take acloser look at it a little bit later.You know how much I love monitor arms.So here went is the dual one by all inwhite so it can match the desk framenicely. Then two 4K displays also byLogic. Nice and glossy. You mightremember it from my previous setupiteration. A vertical stand for MacBookwhich we have removed later just becauseit was better without it. BesidesWoolpad and classic elements 3, we gotRD75 keyboard by Pomier. And to behonest, I'm surprised how good pre-builtkeyboards have became now. Then someminimal looking speakers, a webcam forall his video call goals, and a sprinkleof personalization. I will try to listevery item in my bio. If you cannot findit, then just tag Daniel. I will makesure he will answer all of yourquestions. Obviously, I couldn't leavewithout managing a few cables. And guesswhat? Built-in tray is surprisinglygood.

So, basically ahome theater setup. When I moved intothis house about a few months ago, Idecided to carve out a section of thebasement and make that curiosity areality. Now, the goal was reallysimple. It was to optimize the space forthe best possible media experience. Thatmeant adding soundproofing, installingbuilt-in surround sound, creating anultra comfy seating area, and setting upa top tier 4K projector with a versatilemedia setup to match.What is going on, YouTube? So, this isgoing to be my future home theatersetup, um, which I've cut out as a partof my home studio in my basement. So, ifyou haven't seen that video, you can goahead and check it out. Before I goahead and begin adding things to thisspace, I'm going to quickly give youguys a recap of um, everything that'salready in here and how uh, it's all setup. So, first off, this room measuresabout 123 square ft, which is not verylarge by any means, but perfect enoughfor what I need it for. The ceiling inhere has also been dropped um in orderto accommodate some HVAC system that wasup there before. And since this is goingto be a home theater setup, that's okayas well. During the development stage,um I had them insulate or doubleinsulate the walls and the ceiling inhere to make sure that it's assoundproof as possible. So, that's oneof the most important things that youwould want to consider for a hometheater setup is keeping all the soundcontained inside the room. That way youreally get that experience and also soyou don't have to disturb everybodyaround the house. For insulation, whatI've done is used uh 5/8 drywall. I'veused Sonopan which is a 38 um woodmaterial that's designed for uhsoundproofing as well. And I've alsoused rock in wool uh safe and sound. Soit's an it's a fiberglass system that isdesigned to help reduce sound and justgeneral energy loss from the room.Something else I've done here forsoundproofing is add a solid core doorwhich um in comparison to thealternative which is hollow core doorwill prevent sound and energy lossbetter. I also decided to add someweather stripping material around allthe edges to block any uh amount oflight or air from going in and out ofthe room. So that way like I said wekeep everything contained in here. Thelast thing that I've done in here toimprove the sound quality is add somecarpet. So, instead of using LVP, Idecided to go with um a nice carpet,soft uh and has a different design thanwhat you usually see from theconventional style carpets. Now, it'sgot a bit of a pattern all over it, sonothing crazy, but I think, you know, itworks well for this room right here.Now, we don't have much of it in here. Ionly picked up about 15 uh square yardsof it to fill up the entire room, and itworked out great. It fit the entirespace with very, very little wastage.The next thing I'm going to talk abouthere are the speakers in here. So, I'vedecided to go with a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmassystem um to create that reallyimmersive feeling when watching moviesor gaming in here. As you can see onboth sides, I've got the front left andfront right speakers, and I've also gotthe center channel um below at thebottom there. Behind the camera there,I've got two rear speakers, and I've gotsome overhead speakers up top as well.So, that's two, four, six, sevenspeakers in total and a subwoofer. So,the subwoofer isn't in here right now,but I'm going to have it on this side ofthe room, uh, just right there. So, I'vehad it all set up there. It's connectedor hardwired directly to my server rackon the other side. So, everything inhere is essentially hardwired to myserver rack on the other side where I'vealso got my AVR system. As you can see,I've also got some 6in tall baseboardshere. really gives the room uh kind of amore luxurious look, uh taller look.Even though it's already compressed, itgives it that look, which is reallynice. So, something else to note is thelighting that we've got in here. Ididn't do anything special. It's a 14-indual bright surface mount kit. Now, thiskit will allow you to use a dimmerswitch to control the color temperatureof the lights between 2K and 5K. So,warm white and daylight white. And I'vegot a Lutron dimmer switch connected toit in order to be able to do that. Now,check this out. So, right here, I canreduce or increase the temperature aswell as the brightness while uh usingthis light right here. So, somethingthat I really like about this lightright here, but I don't know how longit's going to be here. I might end upchanging it to something more fancy,something more uh extra, somethingthat's got RGB in it. I don't know. Butright now, I think it works out uh wellfor this room. For temperature controlin here, I've decided to go with a smartvent. So, I've got a single 8x 8 insquare vent um installed up there. So,it's a smart vent that connects to thecentral HVAC system that I've got um setup throughout the entire house. Thissystem will close and open the vent oncommand or on demand depending on whenit's needed. So, I've got a littlecontrol puck installed on the wall overthere to allow or enable that feature.This will allow me or anyone in here toeasily uh tweak the temperature to whatthey need it to be, and the vent willclose and open um as needed. I've got acutout in the ceiling on that sidethere, which is um connected to thebathroom. It's kind of a hatch that willgive me access to um a powered overheadshower that I've got in there. I knowit's something that's not common, but Ireally wanted to do that and I neededaccess um to the outlet that powers thatin the bathroom that will be covered upwith something so it will blend into thewall or the ceiling there and will notbe noticeable. The last thing I want tomention is I've got um a flex tube thatgoes across the entire ceiling to theback there. Um passing across HDMI cableand two Ethernet cables. So, Cat 6Ethernet cables and um an HDMI 2.1 uhcable that will allow me to connect theprojector to my AVR in the room behindme. All right, I'm not going to wasteany more time. Let's go ahead and putthis placetogether. After planning out the space,I quickly realized there was no way tofit side tables in the room withouthaving to compromise on the size of thecouch that I wanted. And trust me, thatjust was not an option I was evenremotely willing to consider. I lookedinto compact side table options thatmight work uh with the layout that Ihad, but nothing really hit the mark.Eventually, I decided to take mattersinto my own hands as usual and go theDIY route. While researching, I cameacross a few very clever setups wherepeople used wall shelves or woodenplanks to create DIY side tables. Thatgave me an idea. I picked up two Melanashelves from IKEA, one for each sidewhere the couch would go. These shelvesusually come in a few different colorsand uh two different length options. Formy setup, I needed them to line upneatly with the armrest. So, I went witha smaller size. Since I was alreadygoing the DIY route here, I figured whynot add some extra functionality, too. Ifound these 3-in recessed power gro thatcome with a built-in 15watt wirelesscharger on the surface. The top slidesopen to reveal two AC outlets, a 20 wattUSBC port, and a USB type A port.Basically everything that one would needto charge daily devices. I mean, they'retechnically designed for desks, but thisfelt like the perfect way to repurposethem. They come in black or white, but Ichose white so they blend in seamlesslywith the shelves. I also picked up a few2-in grommets to create passroughs forany cables running from above the shelfto below it, especially since theshelves are going to be mounted flushinto the corner. To start, I laid downpainters tape over the section I plan tocut. Then I used a measuring tape tomark out the exact length that wouldallow the shelves to line up perfectlywith the couch's armrests. Once themarks were in place, I grabbed mycircular saw and made the cuts. Next upwas drilling the grommet holes. Imeasured out the positions on both endsof each shelf. Larger holes for thepower gro and smaller ones for thepassroughs. I then went ahead andswapped in a circular drill bit matchedto the size of the grommets and drilledthrough the marked spots to create theholes. With the shelves prepped, it wastime to mount them. I started with theright hand shelf, marking the height onthe wall and using a long level to drawa straight guideline across the points.Since the Mlander shelf is originallydesigned to display picture frames, Imounted it upside down to get a flatsurface on the top. I mean, it's a sidetable after all. After installing 75lbwall anchors, I aligned the shelf, linedup the pre-drilled holes, and secured itto the wall. Once it felt solid onthere, I installed the power grommet,screwing it in place. It was a snug fitgetting the screw on piece past the lipof the shelf, but it worked. The passthrough grommet on the other side slidin easily since it didn't require ascrew on mount. I went on to repeat thesame process on the opposite side of theroom for the second shelf. Onceeverything was mounted and the Gro werein place, I tested the built-in chargingstations and everything worked asexpected, I was able to wirelesslycharge my key enabled phone both whenthe charger surface was in place andwhen it was slid off. If you knowanything about me or any of my spaces,then you know I'm a big fan of ambientlighting. So, naturally, that was thenext challenge. Since this room wasbuilt around using a projector, I knew Iwanted to keep the lighting minimal andvery intentional. I had some leftoverblack 90 degree LED diffuser channelsfrom previous projects, so I decided torepurpose them here. Each piece came ina fixed length, so I had to cut themdown to fit the vertical space from thetop of the shelves to the ceiling.Starting on the right side, I beganmounting clips to hold the channels inplace. Once I had a good numberinstalled, I slid the channel into theclips and locked it in. Then I moved onto the top piece, which required onefull length uh channel and anothershorter one to fill the remaining space.Before installing that final cut piece,I jumped over to the left corner andrepeated the same vertical installationprocess I did for the right corner.Although it was much quicker the secondtime around, the LED channel kit camewith corner connectors that allow for aseamless 90° transition. So, I usedthose at both top corners for a cleancontinuous flow of light. I wrappedthings up by installing the final cutchannel on the top side, making sure itjoined perfectly with the existing pieceusing that one's end clip. With thechannels fully mounted, I installed theCOB LED strip that I picked up earlierinside, snapped on the diffusers, andpowered it up using a Ziggb smartcontroller paired with a power adapter.Once everything was connected, I syncedthe lights to my smart home system,giving me full control over brightness,color, and a whole lot more. Next, Iadded a black PS5 controller to thesetup, placing it on a fast wirelesscharge that I picked up from Razer a fewyears ago. I used the pass through gammiI'd installed earlier to route thechargers power cable down to anextension box that I had positionedbehind the couch. I also used the sameextension box to power the other gummypiece on the right wall. To add a bit oftexture to the walls, I decided to pickup something called 3D wall decor panelsoff Etsy. They weren't like anythingthat I'd installed before, but with somehelp from Hannah, we managed to get themall up. Figuring out how to mount themonto the wall and ceiling was definitelythe most timeconuming part of the entireprocess. They didn't come with anyadhesive or mounting hardware, and theinstructions to install them were notclear at all. The seller suggested usingsilicone to hold them in place and ifneeded drive in screws into the sixpre-drilled holes on each base panel.That felt a bit excessive to us, so weended up grabbing some nails from HomeDepot and just used enough to secureeach piece to the wall and the ceiling.Was it the most optimal method? Probablynot, but it did get the job done. Thepanels are designed to form a 3Dhoneycomb pattern. And while they didn'tquite match my expectations perfectlyonce everything was up on the wall, Ihad to admit that it gave the room areally, really unique vibe. It alsohelped the ambient LED lighting standout more rather than just fading intothe plain white walls. We used a mix ofwhite, black, gray, and bronze panels tocreate some contrast and some visualinterest. As for the layouts, we triedour best to create a mirrored lookacross both sides of the room, which tobe frank was not easy at all, but Ithink we pulled it off pretty well. Now,full transparency, the panels weredefinitely pricey for what they are.Each box came in just one color, andsince we wanted four different tones, wehad to buy a few boxes of each color.That racked up the bill pretty quickly.We considered getting more to extend thepattern, but honestly, the cost was asolid hell no for me. At this point, theroom finally had that cozy home theatervibe I was going for, and it was justabout ready for the media setup. Beforethat, there was one last thing that Ihad to take care of, a DIY fix to coverthe ceiling access panel for the showerhead power. It definitely wasn't themost attractive feature in the space.So, I decided to create a cleanersolution. I had an MDF board cut to fitthe space, which I picked up from HomeDepot. Then I wrapped a white striparound all four sides to hide the rawedges and give it a more finished look.Next, I applied small strips of heavyduty double-sided tape around the backof the MDF. Then added weather strippingaround the edge of the ceiling opening.That was mainly to reduce sound and airtransmission through the corners. Asmall detail, but it made sense for amedia room setup. Finally, I pressed theMDF piece into place. The tape held itup nicely for now, but I wouldn't callit a permanent solution at all. It's aquick fix until I figure out a moresolid long-term option. With that out ofthe way, it was finally time to installthe projector. Since saving space was atop priority, I decided to go with aceiling mounted long throw projector.Now, there are a lot of options for thisout there, and I definitely didn't wantto settle for an underwhelming viewingexperience. So, I set a fewnon-negotiable specs the projector hadto meet before I'd even consider it forthe room. After a couple of weeks, Idecided on the Horizon Smax from XJimmy.Big shout out to the brand for sendingover a unit for me to try out. Right outof the box, the projector looked prettypremium and features a built-inadjustable stand with a mounting threadunderneath. There's also a power inputlocated on the base right there. One ofits standout design elements is theautomatic sliding lens cover, whichopens and closes to reveal the lightsource. It's a really neat feature thatadds to its already aesthetic gold misthue. When the cover is in the closedposition, you can see the built-inHarmon Cardan speakers. Although Iwouldn't be needing them for my setup,it's still really nice to have. Also inthe box was a pair of batteries, a poweradapter, and a remote. All having thesame gold mist hue as the projectoritself. It even came with a Google TV 4Kstick, which you get for free with apurchase of the projector. XJimmy alsosent out a couple of accessories uh forthe projector, including the ceilingmount and a floor stand. These do notcome standard with the projector, butare available as optional add-ons. Theceiling mount also has the protector'sgold mist aesthetic and comes in threepieces. It has a special compartmentthat houses the protector's power blockinside of it, keeping things reallyclean. The floor stand, on the otherhand, came in two easy to assemblepieces and the same gold mist aesthetic,though I do not plan on using it in thiscase. We moved on to installing theceiling mount next. The process waspretty straightforward and all I had todo was secure the power adapter insideits dedicated compartment, then securethe mounts to the ceiling using screwson all sides. I initially tried routingmy HDMI cable through the mount as well,but it made the cover not fit properly.So, I left that hanging out the back asit seems the mount cable management wasonly designed for the projector's powercable. The last step in the process wasattaching the mount's final piece to theprojector and then locking it into placeon the ceiling. It held up really welland from there, all that was left wasplugging in the power and the HDMIcable. The central control unit foreverything going into the projector isthe Pioneer VSSX 935 AVR, which I pickedup specifically for this setup. AVRshave been around for as long as I canremember, and honestly, they're stillone of the best solutions for unifiedhome the media control. That said,they're usually pretty bulky, so therewas no way I was going to have onesitting inside the actual movie room.Instead, I talked it neatly into mymedia rack right where it belongs. TheHDMI cable I connected to the projectorfeeds into one of the two HDMI outputports on the AVR, which is then linkedto all eight surround sound speakers inthe room, delivering a full highqualityaudio experience. On the input side, theAVR gives you eight HDMI input ports,which means I can connect everythingfrom gaming consoles to streamingdevices with ease. For streaming, Ipicked up an Apple TD4K with an Ethernetport and hooked it directly into boththe AVR and my network switch to ensurethe best possible connection. Trust me,there's going to be no buffer in here. Ialso brought in my first gen PS5, placedit on the media rack, and connected itto both the AVR and the Switch as well.With everything routed through the AVR,I've got centralized control,highfidelity audio, and ultra cleancable management, all without taking upspace in the actual viewing area. It'sphenomenal. I know. At this point, theroom already had that cozy home theatervibe I was aiming for. But the nextpiece we brought in took things to awhole new level. We decided to go withsomething called a cloud couch for theseating in the area. mainly because ofhow unbelievably comfy they usually are.The comfort level of a cloud couch isoften compared to what it would feellike to sleep on a real cloud, whichobviously explains the name. I've neverowned one myself before, but I've alwayswanted to, so I figured this was theperfect excuse to finally splurge. Andyeah, it was definitely a splurge. Thiscouch was not cheap by any meanswhatsoever, but I wanted to make sureevery second that was spent in this roomwas as comfortable as possible. Cloudcouches are fully customizable, kind oflike Maja sofas you see everywhere. Now,taking a room's layout and spaceconstraints into account, we went withtwo corner pieces, one centerpiece, andtwo ottomans. It also came with a bunchof soft oversized pillows, but we alsodecided to add a few accent ones for asubtle pop of color.I originally considered getting twosubwoofers for this space, buteventually realized that woulddefinitely be a bit overkill for such asmall space. One was more than enough toget the impact I was after. To keepthings consistent with the rest of theaudio setup, I went with a Pulk audiosub. It came in black, which didn'tmatch the white speakers, but honestly,it's subtle enough that it doesn't standout in a distracting way. Next up on theagenda was setting up the projector andall the media devices I had hooked up toit. As soon as the projector powered on,the first thing I did was pair it withthe remote and then went on to connectto Wi-Fi before jumping into the initialsetup process. The projector is equippedwith autofocus, which automaticallysharpens the image projected withoutneeding to do anything manually. There'salso a manual focus option if you wantto fine-tune it, but honestly, theautofocus worked perfectly right out ofthe box. Next was auto keystonecorrection, another time-saving featurethat adjusts the screen alignment inreal time. That alone made positioningway easier. Once that was set, I gotinto the manual alignment tools to tweakthe image just a bit further. It didn'ttake very long, just a few minorcorrections, and then I moved on to oneof the most interesting parts of thesetup. The projector gave me the optionto choose between the new dual light 2.0light source mode or the moretraditional laser mode. Dual light 2.0on the Horizon S Max offers higherbrightness up to 3100 lumens, a widercolor gamut, better contrast, andoverall more accurate color reproductionand also a more comfortable viewingexperience. Of course, I decided to gowith this new mode to see how it works.Another standout feature is the ultrawidec screen mode. Definitely a firstfor me on a projector. It's a very cooloption to have, especially if I decideto bring a gaming PC into the mix lateron. The Horizon S Max also comes withsomething called wall color adaptation,which helps calibrate the projector'scolors based on the surface it'sprojecting onto. I'm currently using thestandard white painted wall as myscreen. And even then, this featurehelped refine the color accuracy andimprove the overall image quality. Aftergetting through the initial setup, Imade a few physical adjustments to theprojector's angle, then went back intothe settings for another round of autokeystone correction along with somelight manual tweaking. You'll find allthe image correction tools likeautofocus, screen shift, image zoom, andmore right in the settings menu of theprojector. But honestly, there's notmuch that needs to be done manually.Most of it just works straight out ofthe box. Next, I switched theprojector's input source to the HDMIports connected to my AVR in the otherroom. A few seconds later, my Apple TVpopped up on the screen. No extra setupneeded since I'd already configured itbeforehand. The projector automaticallyenabled IMAX enhanced mode, which was anice touch. First thing I did was testout how it handled video playback frommy Plex server and other platforms. Now,while the video was playing, I realizedI hadn't turned on Dolby Vision on theApple TV. something the projector isfully capable of handling. So, I jumpedinto the settings menu and made theswitch immediately. I went ahead andtweaked a few more settings to match mypreferences, then continued the clip,this time with Dolby Vision fullyenabled. The result, phenomenal. Idecided to test out the PS5 digitalnext. I had that hooked up to thededicated HDMI 2.1 game port on the AVR.As expected, since it was connected to anew display, it walked me through theusual screen alignment and HDRcalibration process. After updating thesystem firmware, I jumped straight intoa session of God of War to see how wellthe projector handled realtime gaming.And honestly, it did not disappoint. TheHorizon Sax also has game optimizingfeatures, uh, like low latency and awhole lot more, which can be accessedthrough the settings menu as well. MyXbox Series X hadn't been getting muchuse in its previous location. So, Iadded it to the media rack to sitalongside the PS5 as well. Just like Idid with the PS5, I hooked it up with ahardwired internet connection for themost reliable performance and thenplaced an Xbox controller on anotherwireless charger stored neatly on thesame wall shelf. Once powered on, Ioptimized the Series X for the Horizon SMax and loaded up Assassin's CreedOdyssey for a quick gaming session.What's a home theater without snacks andbeverages? Just outside of the roomwithin my studio space, I've got a wetbar setup complete with storage drawersand a mini fridge stocked for movienights, gaming sessions, and everythingin between. At the end of it all, theroom turned out even better than I'dimagined, and it fully delivered on thepurpose that I had in mind for it. Thankyou guys for sticking with me throughoutthis one. I really appreciate it. Let meknow down in the comment section whatpart of the room you like the most.

Bro your setups are always INSANE! The details, your ability to build anything, and those 3D wall panels!
Yessir, the perfect kick back and relax video after a long day of work
Awesome setup. If you're going to get a screen raise the centre channel so it's in line with your left and right and get an acoustic transparent screen.
You should definitely consider adding a screen to your projector setup — it would elevate the overall aesthetic of the room and prevent the space from feeling incomplete when the projector is off. Additionally, the Apple TV isn’t configured correctly for Dolby Vision HDR. You’ll want to leave Dolby Vision disabled under Format settings, and instead enable Match Dynamic Range and Match Frame Rate in the Match Content settings. Excellent video — keep up the great work.
you won't believe how long i have waited for this episode following the previous ones
This video has definitely inspired me to step my game up
Bruh those polygon panels is dope AF! Awesome room!
You're an impressive dude. Great inspiration for old and young alike
It’s grommet (grom-met) not (grom-may). Nicely done, I’m so jealous of your setups , bro! Lol.
The fact that you’re Nigerian and achieving all of this really inspiring can’t lie 
I’m really motivated mennn
Nice setup, if you get/got an acoustically transparent screen you could put your LCR all in line at the same level right behind the screen that would them match the voices to the dialogue coming from the screen rather than from the floor. A huge difference in the sound performance of your system. I'm sure your past that point so maybe an upgrade in the future, but a dedicated space in and of itself is amazing.
Theaters are painted black not white. To minimize light bouncing off the ceiling and walls
Great setup, really nice. Congrats. I would consider raising your center channel to ear level, go with a darker color for your walls, and lastly, install acoustic panels to kill sound reflections from the speakers and it will improve your listening experience.
it looks really good! the contrast of colors is super clean!
Get a screen first of all, and you need to make your room darker, preferably with black velvet materials for better contrast.
This was a great watch. super chill diy, great job.
Picking up on just little bit of that island accent. Not enough there to tell where from, but it's there, my man! Love your content, bredda
Nize setup i have a white wall too for home cinema but i prefere dark walls more, so that bright scenes doesnt bounce off all over the place but it may be personal preference
FYI, you should change your Apple TV setting to 4k SDR 60hz. And then set “match for content”. Otherwise everything will be displayed in HDR (up converted).
New to the channel. Love the full walkthrough build of your home theater
felicidades, ese cuarto es increiblemente estupendo, buen sonido, bonita imagen, comodo y completamente apartado de los ruidos exteriores, increiblemente bello.
bros living in paradise
Absolutely love the setup, awesome work !
The only thing I would add would be another shelf behind the back of the couch so who ever is in the middle will also have somewhere to put things or u can use it just for a little extra storage space. This is something I even want to do for my own living room couch, just an idea. But I love the whole set up!!
All i can see is a fire keep it up bro
The style and everything is amazing. I think my IRIS Device agrees bc the “take a break” notification popped up w/o muting or even pausing your video. Subscribed!
The issue with using AVR’s for hdmi is the older ones are usually not hdmi 2.1 passthrough. People should check that because you can lose quality when running next gen consoles like PS5. The pioneer vsx935 in this video from 2021 does have 2.1 though. Just something for the viewers to check. If you’re running an older AVR for sound then you should run the 2.1 device straight to the tv/projector, then run a digital optical cable straight back to the AVR. Or if you have a tv with a HDMI ARC/eARC you can use that HDMI input as your hdmi input from the AVR to the tv ARC means Audio Return Channel so it has 2 purposes- Sending video to the tv from the AVR and also audio from the tv back to the AVR
Looks great man. Also worth mentioning, that Halo 20th Anniversary edition Series X is fiiiireeee. Damn it's awesome.
Gj mate ! Room looks amazing .
Super cool and creative hopefully you get good use of the room
DopeNess As Always Brother!!! When you guys were installing the honeycomb decor… 13:19 I was like da hell going on here Yall Got it Looking Good!! Take Care Brother!!
You already know it's gon be a banger
Nice! I think i saw another video of yours that was just a soundbar. AVR with surround sound is the way to go! Very nice. I would have elevated the center with a screen that allows audio passthrough, had 4 heights and had external amps, but im sure you did your research and got exactly what you wanted. The server rack always keeps things organized! Very nice! Next upgrade, think about bass shakers. Nice wetbar
Amazing set up. Would highly recommend using a screen. Even the best newest sheet rock will dull your picture. Sheetrock is not designed to display a projector, obviously u can do it. It’s like shinning an extremely bright light on your wall. Even the cheapest of screens will offer a better viewing experience. Don’t take my word for it, do your own reasearch and you can always try a screen and see how it goes and return it if it’s not helping. the one upside to not having a scree with your projector is you can switch very easily from 16:9 to wide screen. And most movies are in widescreen, but not all. Not having a screen would allow you to switch back and forth easily. They make screens like that, but they are highly expensive. Good luck. Love that couch
I didnt know avr was a thing till now , Great video and very informative
Wow, Great set up. Love what you have done to the place. When can I move in?
It's beautiful, and makes me reluctant to nitpick -- but as an HT designer fora long time, I would have said to go AT to prevent those LR speakers from being jammed in the corners, and the center being so low. That said, the space is very inviting.
i was so exited to see what do you mean for a home theater 
and here it is the video
let see what you cooked for us
good luck bro
much love to you from Iran
Good video bro and nice man cave
Same as acoustic panels, there are diffusion panels for video projectors, you have pollution from the ceiling as you can see
You did a great job on room
Always well paced and informed videos, that explain and show what needs to be. Great room again
Ive been waiting to watch this, i had it saved on watch later and i wish i had seen it sooner, AC odyssey was quite a platinum along with god of war Ragnarok
You guys are bosses fantastic job
I have been waiting for this one!
Good vid man ... Gave me some ideas for my own set up
Gangsta man cave my bro
would have used a magnetic latch and use some hinges on that access panel since it likely will be opened again.
My fav part was the bathroom
Giving some ideas bro! Great content
Nice video dude, as always.
We need a full blown 2 hr tutorial of how that server rack and all the components interconnect into one another I wanna do that my self
Looks good
I was literally just watching an old video of yours bro
Good Job
You'll likely be getting a huge amount of audio reflections off the front left and right side walls right up to the speakers, because they are against the side wall. You need accoustic panels there. Ideally they should have been closer in off the walls, but too late now. Such an enclosed small refective space for audio isn't going to be great anyway, but the furniture would help a lot. Still, you really need something to fix those front speakers.
Also, how do you breath in there? I'd be worried about poor ventilation in such a sealed space. How does the air coming in even get out?
Man can u tell me what is your work? Damn it was so crazy to watch your videos
the best gaming setup
The best way to do an installation at home and be able to solve any future problems is to do it yourself, since this way you do not depend on anyone to solve your problems... Yes, I know that not everyone can, either because of knowledge or possibility, but that is the reality.
For the ceiling cover I would use magnets
Why you didnt use a panel and used the all wall? And how you control the devices that are on the other room? Thanks for the videos. Fantastic
Personally the wall panels were a lot! I would've used them on the back wall only
Where did you get the cloud couch from, it is fire
Nice set up. Do you have a link to that carpet? Thanks!
link to couch?
damnnnnnnnnnn, am jaw opened, i always tell people of your setups, TOP NOTCHH
Just FYI, grommets are prounounced ""Grom-mets""...not ""Grom-Mays"".
Love your vids. FYI, grommet is pronounced ""graa·muht"".
Fantastic work. How big is your room in dimensions?
love it! One thing though, it's pronounced ""grahm-ette"" not ""grahm-ay"" lol had me chucklin a lil bit. Seriously though you did a fantastic job!!!
Nice
Great Video. I always wait for new videos. By the way, how you can control your Pioneer AVR from your tv room and choose which HDMI output for example?
You should have went with a laser TV projector with an ALR screen.
7.1.4 is ideal
Bro, this is a fantastic space, that honeycomb is just But I am curious, after my own experience with an ultra short throw projector, why didn't you consider that? Something like the Hisense PX3 that I reviewed recently would be incredible. Love the work here dawg and I can't wait to see more of the house.
Awsome
Bro works out his biceps with cement trucks
Bro, how are you Upgraded? . Great video
you have a great set up but your are not getting full advantage from the projector using a wall , get a nice white screen with 1.1 gain and thank me later and if you want deeper black and color an ALR screen material will suit you very well

“We’re talking consoles, maybe pc, cuz i just don’t do consoles” ah yes truly inspirational ️
Bro I have been watching ur vids like a year ago till now! and all I can say is the more I watch ur vids and see how u improve ur gaming house the more respect and admired I become. I wanna say ur undareted asf cuz 125k subscriber for someone that spends alot of money on his vids and make high quality vids is js so undareted. I hope u become more famous and get the fame u deserve. keep it up with ur work and I can't wait till the gaming house is 100%
""Console's not that bad"" 
""oh it is"" 
Had me dying
Love the videos my man! Hope things go well with your kids!
HEY SAMSON, THAT LARGE SETUP THAT YOU SAID YOU PROBABLY WONT USE AGAIN, IM A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY AND I'D LOVE IT AND ENJOY IT FOR YEARS TO COME! (i don't know if this sounds selfish, im just really asking here)
It was epic seeing the transformation and how this amazing new space was put together
bro I'm sorry but that small monitor as the main when you have this crazy curved monitor for like using discord is a crime
first video ive watched of yours man its great cant wait to watch more.
let's not decorate with plants like the average peasant... no, let's decorate with over 3000 dollars in spare parts and keyboards.
Bro I absolutely love your channel,I just started watching your vids a couple of days ago, love from south Africa
Video update please for when that TV falls down. Wild only using drywall anchors.
For your TV there is a great draw wall thing you can get from home depot for like $20. It's called an anchor. (Fliptoggle 1/4 in. x 2-1/2 in. Plastic with Screw). Can hold up 137lbs without studs. I recommend it for dry wall because just using the screws alone on drywall can cause the screws to fall out overtime and that won't be good for your TV. SO PLEASE get those wall anchor.
You missed the strip that goes at the end of your Desktop. I did that too.. it keeps you from having exposed wood at the end of your shiny desk!!
how are you so rich
In which app does he setup the room?
first video ive seen, this was crazy bro well played...well played.
That breath on that 5080 was like a slow knife turn to the back
insane setup bro amazing work wish i had one like this
I gotta be honest. Ive never had the money to get a pc, let alone a room like this and its the only thing i can wish for. And seing a HUGE guy building his (also my) dream room/setup, just makes me wanna build my own dream setup just like this but i dont have the money for it lol. If i didn't say it already, YOU ARE HUGEEEEE. Great video btw! Earned a sub!
7:31 Nah why did u regret Harvard 
That like very smart person dream
It's crazy to think that with 21k, which you spent on your entire room, here in Brazil you could only afford the 4090....But here I am, watching and dreaming.
you forgot a speaker
This came across to my feed, and I watched it til the end, it's an inspirational video and a very motivating video for a small content creator like me, I hope one day I get monetized and build myself a setup like this one! Thank you for creating this wonderful video, and you deserve more subscribers!
10:46 one of those is as much as my hole pc set up
If you were able to plan the room from studs, why didn't you put a piece of wood where the mounts would be? It hurts me. Especially when you spent $30,000.
This is cool but would switch the monitors
13:20 why did the moniter layout make me cringe
15:54 awsome set up but please put the pc part boxes away
Wait, hold up. 1 SSD? That is almost sacrilege. Almost every PC gamer knows to never install a game on the C: drive. We, as PC gamers know that there should always be a second or third SSD drive and the games go there. The launcher can be installed on C: but the game files go on the D: drive for optimal load times like the assets and textures on big maps load in correctly and not dealing with PS2 graphics, waiting for the high-res textures to load in.

Personally, I haven't installed a game on the C: drive since 2006.
yo i need one of the 5080's ive got a damn 1650
Trying to…contain…..the troll, too much caffeine ingested…but my better half wins, kind of
SOOOOO UNDERRATED for such high quality not all youtubers are able to do this (i understand he is rich)
“quin up here yes its made if concrete. No no quin up here” had me rolling
9:46 was that Patrick mahomes
3rd setup?
0:06 the highest NPCs is crazy
damn i think that is a beast of a setup that is sick now im thinking of switching form console to pc that is a sick setup good job on it
You’re a great strong young man keep up the hard work on you’re vids I love them
right after the gaming house is complete have everything running just for an hour and show how much the electricity bill will be haha.
the gaming room looks really nice
That is insane bruh
the third setup could be a decked out simulator. what about that? it woud be SUPERCOOL!
I'm going to be getting a PC soon but I've used console my entire life
what happened to the 3rd set up
I dont mean to sound buzzkill sir, but I think huge windows are security concerns, and I think steel bars/burglar bars can provide security...
you should reupload this and blur out that shipping label on the amazon package
9:02 what music did you use?
""scream when I"", every gamer knows what that means and has had that expierence whether hardcore or casual gamer. LOL
yo bro all the stuff you got is very nice you made me thinking if i should renovate my room
$30,000 you only have like almost 200 K subscribers. How do you afford this man like honestly
First video I've watched of you, already 1 min and 40 sec into the vid and I'm already loving this DUDE, SUBSCRIBED!!!!!!!
Mano, primeira vez aqui no canal que vídeo sensacional, continua assim que você vai muito mais longe, só uma crítica sobre o tradutor do BR está muito ruim, mais tirando essa crítica vídeo está pesado de bom +1 escrito brow 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Don’t stop gaming put a Nintendo switch in there or make a wall and hook a tv up and put a shelf in the bathroom witw different Xbox pro gaming controllers
I sadly have never had a pc but watching you makes me feel like i do!.
Bro needs a gaming gym transformation next
Next build a tunnel under your house into the gaming house
Bro can u do my roomur so good but fr can you

Love this channel keep going
You’re like Steve from Blues Clues but for video games cool!
so sickkk
bro i swear he is funny favorite youtuber
first time watching you lol and actually enjoyed the vid keep it up bro
And im a Subscriber for sure
Where did you get the Wood panels from? and how much is each panel? That looks really cool and I might like that for my setup in the future.
been here since the cabin. i mean if i can't afford shit why not watch someone that can. saving up for my dream build but gotta go with a rx 580 8 gb first than maybe next year i'll go for 1080toi 11gb but still 2 months before i can even get my budget build going. than i'll finally be able to game. Going for all black and no RGB, never been the biggest fan of it
I love your humor!!!!!!!
wuts the wallpaper???
buliding a Dream $30,000 Gaming Room!. ""more like a whole house""""
It's funny I bought a Alex drawer and I did the SAME thing build it up side down.
Wow!
Love the setup keep it up
16:20

Which specific remix of ""Back 2 Back"" is this?
Ur gonna get screen burn in with that oled tv's backround (unless its a slideshow which it might be)
I did not know eather net was a thing but now that I know it is I want it
W vid man trying to get my setup like yours one day
When (or if) you have any spare setup parts, can I have them?
me personally cause i like cars i would put car models in the rgb cases
No way you guys actually mounted an Oled screen with just dry wall mounts.. i hope you fix that before the end of the video

Long overdue. We'refinally building this gaming setup at astudio. And we're at where any goodgaming setup begins. Orange County,California. Let's go. I don't know whatI'm getting. How much you think I'mgoing to spend?[Music]I have a checklist of things that weneed for this setup. Starting with thePC. I already have one, but we'll seewhat they have because maybe I'llupgrade my PC. Hey, of course we come onthe most busy day. 5080s. 5080s. I wasreally hoping for a 5090. Maybe we won'tupgrade the PC today. I really want onethough. Low key. Should I just get itanyways even though it's not a 5090? No.How long you think I need? Long enough.Six. [ __ ] one of these. Oh, they gotcable management stuff. Oh, I need that[ __ ] bro. Yeah, you do. My [ __ ] Weshould make a video fixing Josh's setupone day. We should show him my PC withthe leg stand. That [ __ ] tilt, dude.There's a lot of zip ties here, but tobe honest, zip ties are overrated andit's a lot of work if you want to takeit down. Something like this is a littlebetter because it's velcro, like velcroties, and it's easier to take off. Youdon't have to cut them. Something likethis as well, just to like tidy up thecables together. I know I'm going toforget something. That's That's theproblem. You have the Ethernet cablealready, right? Yeah, we need that. Ishould have had a plan. I never have aplan. It's like the most boring microcenter haul ever. We'll get some morecool stuff. What the What is that? Yougot to buy a new camera. No, that'sscared me. I'm broke. Hey Josh, you needa new blow dryer. Tell me why I walkedin his room once. He's using anelectronic air duster to dry his hair.I'm like, ""Bro, I got one. I should usemine."" It wasn't even blowing air, but Iwas blowing dust exposing me. You don'tneed no RGB. Oh, check. That boy tall.You might need Sony monitors. Sonymonitors. I think we have one. Probablynot the same one cuz this new ever. Oh,that's a new new one. Yeah, this onejust came out probably have this oneright here. It looks like has like thesame stand. So, this one's 480 Hz. Wait,they're both 480 Hz. Wait a minute.Similar specs. It's 2K 480. This is 2K480. Is that same size? 27 in. I'll beright back, man. We're in the monitorsection. It was looking grim. Normally,I'd also need to pick up a monitor, butI already have one at home uh thanks toSony. They have one in stock and I'm washoping to have a dual monitor setup, sothey're going and they're grabbing itfor me right now. Oh, you got it for meright there. Here you go. All right,guys. Oh, it is the same monitor. Is itthe same monitor? Bang. Yeah. Yeah, thesame name. Sort of the same box. Is thisthe last one? It's the only one. Thankyou, guys. Have a good one. Let's go.With this monitor, it's the first timeI'm not buying monitor mounts because ofthe design of the monitor mount. It'sactually pretty sick. And I'll show youguys more later. I think we're good.That's a wrap for Micro Center. UnlessJosh, you want some? Yeah. $10,000. Buyas much as you want. $50 for a cable? Idon't know if I want it that bad. $50?Oh, it's the goat. The goat. This islike the LeBron of esports, bro. It'scrying out.Actually, is the goboy. What you know about this? Come on,bro. Stop playing. What you know aboutthis?Only one they had.Is that crazy?[Music]Help me out.[Music]Black and white. One, two. Car has aura.You already know what where you at.Somehow we always end up here in everyvideo, right Josh? Like I swear I don'tcome here all the time. Yeah, we're justgetting like a bunch of desk accessoriesand a countertop for the table. [ __ ] inthe car, bro. What? Don't say that.[Music][Music]It's been a while since you guys haveseen the studio. This area is a totalmess, but we're working on it. We gotsome small progress here. The KiloEscape has made a return. We got somerandom jumbosized Pokémon cards. Shoutout to Cracks Toys, my boy Matt. SomePro Grails. This little area is kind ofcool. We got Josh eating this littleshell. I love this area. This plant ishuge now. I got this plant a year ago.Look how much it's grown. It's all theway over here now. You guys rememberthis living room. We turn around. We gota live streaming setup. By the way, letme turn this light on. Much better. Thishas been a lot of fun. Bubble M is thegreatest Pokémon card ever made. Car'shere.But yeah, this is like the last part ofthe studio. I really need some seriouswork. There's this big wall over here.I'm going to clear all of this out andthen build my new gaming setup.It's been a while since I actually hadWell, okay. I have a gaming setup athome, but it's kind of like a makeshiftsetup. Plan to have this place for along time. So, this setup is very, verypermanent. But also, we're taking a verydifferent approach than his setups inthe past. I still stream, not as much.So, the main focus here is it lookinggood, not the functionality. Although,I'm not going to build a setup that'simpractical to use.[Music]One problem. So, tabletop thing that webought, it's too small cuz like thispiece is supposed to connect the twolegs, but um as you can tell, it'staller than the desk. And then this thisis the top. The depth of the desk isalso smaller. I realized what I didwrong cuz when I bought this frame, itwas supposed to originally be for abigger tabletop. I get what you mean.So, it's going to be like hanging likeYeah. Yeah. So, we got a new one. Oh mygoodness. Things always go wrong.Finally, since the last clip that youguys saw, it's been about 3 or 4 days. Iwent to the bay, visited family, andalso went to a Warriors game. We went ona whole mission today just to get thistable top. I know it doesn't look likeanything special, and trust me, itisn't, but it's exactly what I waslooking for.So, this is birch plywood. I got it fromHome Depot. It's finished already. Um, Imight have to stand up and fix up acouple random things, but it's wood.It's never going to be perfect, and I'mperfectly fine with it being unfinishedor like not perfect. Long story short,we went to a Home Depot. They had thewood that we wanted. Pause. But themachine to cut the wood didn't work. Andoriginally this was 4 ft deep, which istoo long for a desk, but I feel likethis is basically perfect. Now, themoment of truth is making sure that thisthing fits on this thing. 1,000% Ishould have measured it. Oh, barely.It's like an inch. So, I don't know ifyou can see,but yeah, we're good. It clears. This isgoing to be a sick desk. By far the mostunique desk I've ever built. And it'ssuper simple. So, perfect. Step numberone, we got to build this frame. Then,I'm debating whether or not I actuallywant to put or drill or glue thecountertop to the frame itself or justput it on top and then put like rubberor something so it doesn't, you know,scrape or scratch. We'll cross thatbridge when we get there.[Music]What is in here?Sounds like screws.Voila.Tons of them.These are like the little feet thing.And then there's a little beam in themiddle to make sure everything's stable.Hey,perfect. No, this is exactly how I wantit. This desk is huge. This desk ishuge. The way we rock. Scary. Live lifeon the edge. It's It's massive, bro.Hey, it looked better, huh? Big olddesk. Have you ever seen a gaming setupdesk this big? Yeah, it looks like adining table. Lookie. Nice. 3 2 1[Applause]Weno.[Music][Music]What do you think? Are youall the way? No.Nice.Cool. So, desk is mostly done. This isprobably the coolest desk I've everowned. Not the most unique desk, but Ithink it's pretty different for likegaming setups. What you think, Josh?Yeah. Jump on it.It finally break it out. Okay, so fromhere, I'd probably normally startbuilding the actual setup itself. What Iwant to do is start putting this stuffon the wall. Start with mounting thestuff. Have these pegboards. Probably goeven from the middle, left and right. Ialso have this shell, which I'llprobably go offset onto this sidebecause I already have a basketball loopright there.[Music]I want it to be like[Music][Music]Can't help myself. See what this feelslike with a real chair. I've alwayswanted a desk. It's huge. It's a new dayand I recruited alltime greats.He brought in the big guns. Oh yeah. Ialways had this dream to get thismassive desk, but also I didn't realizethat it would like bend this much. So Itook a quick trip to IKEA and yeah,let's do this earn stuff. Well, time toget to work. Since this desk is so thin,I have to use like the thinnest screwsever. Like, they're so tiny. What? It'llbe fine, right? Yeah.They're um half an inch because the deskthickness is 38 of an inch. Y'all shouldsee my POV right now.Big ass eyes. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. So,y'all see I think you guys can see howmuch it's bending just by that thatspot.Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have muchfaith in these little screws, butOh, if you're wondering why I have twowhite dogs, one is our friend. Yeah.Looks good. No more bend. Missionaccomplished. So, with the desk done, wecan now get to building the actual setupitself. Monitor stand is so cool. Theyprobably get mad at me for doing this,too, huh? And any good setup starts withthe monitor. Thankfully, while Sony sentme that one, I bought this one. Andalso, this video is sponsored by Sony.Micro Center had one last one of theSony M10S monitor. For any setup ofmine, at least especially gaming setups,you need to have at least two monitors.The Sony M10S is a monster performerdisguised as a minimalistic productivitymonitor. The chassis and design languagescream simple, but the specs scream topof the line. 480 Hz, 27 in OLED, QHD1440p, small bezels, easy setup,lightweight, minimalistic stand, and athin display with a innovative coolingsystem. I genuinely can't name anythingwrong with the M10s. Oh yeah, and as Imentioned earlier, this is the firsttime I'm completely ditching a deskmount. I still have nightmares trying tomount 30 lb monitors. Not fun at all.But with this, I feel like I'm notsacrificing anything at all. All whilehaving no compromise on performance, I'mall in. I've been able to use my otherSony M10S for about a month already.Loved it so much I went out of my way tobuy another and Sony doesn't even knowthat. While they are the sponsor oftoday's video, I will say if thismonitor has taught me anything, it'sthat the days of going for the highestrefresh rate monitor and ignoringeverything else are over for me. I stillremember when 240 Hz was all the craze.Now double that and add every premiumquality of life feature into awell-designed chassis and you'll findthis monitor, the Sony M10S. You cancheck it out with the link in my bio.Sony, thank you again for sponsoringthis video and helping me build my dreamgaming setup for like the 75th time.Okay, so this is going to go up. So thenthis is going to go like this. And thenthey like[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]$50.[Music]It was orange. So I had to[Music]like this thing's a smiley face.real ones from like my community and thestreams know the importance of thesmiley face. So, if you know, you know,we also had to cut it. Shout out toErnstell for the idea. I would havenever never thought of that. Hey,hey,it should be in the middle of this andthis way. No, I don't really know wherethe[Laughter]Give me that.A little cricket. Like just shimmy me itthis way. Just Oh,yeah. That's good. Perfect. Thisactually does look cool.All right. Taking this off.All right. So, this is a magazine I gotplaying basketball, but it's signed byKD. Oh, wait. I should move this.Thought this would be a good place forit, too. And it's orange with thepegboard. I didn't know what to put onit, but I think it looks okay for now. Idon't need to overdo it. Yeah.[Music]I always wanted this mic cuz it's white.Oh my god. Are you okay?Is it okay? We're good. Is it recording?Yeah. Oh my god. Chat broke his lens.How much is the lens? Two racks. Betterget a million views. I don't even wantto record anymore. Where should I putthis? Well,thank God. Hey, Sony, how about wesponsor a lens video?[Music][Music]It's day three building in the setup andtoday we're going to finish it. Right,Josh? Mhm. I'm about to I'm about totell himwhat theall my hard work. Here's a littleprogress report of where we're at.Thanks to Ernstell for helping meyesterday. Put it on the desk. Hey Har,what you think? No. No. Come back. Har,say cheese. The crazy part is that shegoes on the table at home. Um, afterWhat happened? Huh? Still my toe. No.What happened to my tripod?We got this picture up yesterday.Decorated a little bit, of course. Gotthe monitor set up. I put the 151Charizard right here. I think I want toput the full evolution. I feel like thatwould be sick. That sucks. What? Youdon't got it.You did it again.That's you, bro. It's tough. Remember myold sub um sub emotes? S smiley faces.Josh, if I put you in charge of cablemanagement, you think you can do it?Do you mind? It's everywhere. Today,we're starting with cable management cuzclearly uh well, I don't have that manycables plugged in yet, but it's the mostimportant part of any any setup, period.I got this big old desk. So, that's mymission. This shouldn't be that hard.I'm going to start with this powerstrip. We got to get it mounted righthere. Um, I don't really have an exactidea of where I'm going to put it. Ijust kind of put it somewhere and thencall it a day. This a good spot, right?All right. Can you hold that side up?This is so weird. Hurry up, bro. No, I'mlowkey enjoying my time down here. [ __ ]Hurry up.All right. I should do the other side,huh? Yeah.Oh my dog.Why are you still here?I kind of want to move the uh cablemanagement thing to the left, too.This is going to be pretty boring, butumlots of cables. I'll update you when Ihave something else.maybe some advice or insight for peopletrying to manage their cables. A problemmost people run into when building agaming setup is that their cables aretoo short and that's why they can'tcable manage it. Definitely invest insome longer cables. I usually if it's ashort distance, I do at least 6 ft. Thisone's 6 ft. This one's 10 ft.And I even got an extension for like apower extension just in case I neededit. Things like this always make adifference. In the past, I would gosuper crazy with the cable management,but in all honesty, like I'm lazy,especially now. So, I just bought thislittle like rack thing. I'm just goingto put all the cables on there. It's notthat big of a deal to me. As long as thecables aren't touching the floor orhanging, um, then I did my job. Andespecially cuz I know I'm the type ofperson that likes tochange gear. And see, like, look howshort this cable is. But I'm the type ofperson person that likes to change gearand nicely cable managing everything isnot the move when that's the type ofperson I am. Also, I know I used tonever use these things, but somemonitors have like a little cablemanagement thing right here. Definitelyuse them because they're there for areason. Also, when you have a really bigdesk, um cables are going to be likethis. And the only way to really make itlook nice are cable sleeves.So, you know, the cables won't be gone.You can't magically just make themdisappear,but at least you can make it look neat,and that's that's the whole goal here.I'm going to cut this, but I'll show youguys what it looks like after.Would you look at that?Careful. All right. So, I'm in a littlebit of a predicament. I want to put thePC like tucked off in the corner foronce because I always put it on theright side of the desk, but I didn'tthink about how the cables would just besticking out over here and that kind ofit don't make me feel good. So Josh saidI should put a plant here. I was like,""Well, Josh, you actually had a goodidea for once."" This is what I decidedon. I just moved that plant to theground and pushed the um side tableback. But we'll plug everything in andthen I'll try my best to use the cablesleeves to make it look kind of tidy.Obviously cables are cables and they'regoing to be there, but hopefully itlooks okay.One thing about me, it's about thedetails. Got an orange XLR cablefor absolutely no reason. I don't knowif you can tell, but I've been likingorange recently.[Music]Make sure to keep your XLR cablesseparated from the rest of your cables,or else you'll get static in your mic.And another thing, these Velcro ties areway better than zip ties, no matter whatanyone says. Not my best work, but umgood enough for me. You got nuts in hisback. Yeah.What the Why are you not petting me? Hedon't want you to do that no more. Whyyou still crouch like that?Yeah,yeah,yeah. Look, look. It's like I'm racingon father time. Hard to see the visionwhen you only see dollar signs. Stick toplan A cuz the B feel like compromise.Thinking [ __ ] sweet. This the like theydon't advertise. Supposed to use yourvoice, but when you do, you getostracized. Overall, I'm really happywith how it turned out. Feel like theblue here contrasts really well with allthe orange. I added some little detailsbecause well, I love this bag and it'sone of the coolest collabs in gaminghistory up there. Of course, I had toput the Dreamcast. Something about theart on these boxes just looks so cool.And it's nice to have this much space onthe right side of my desk cuz usually myPC is there. And as much as I love myPC, which is still my old PC, the onethat I had at at the house in my setupthere, I just moved it. I like howsimple it looks while still being verycolorful, lots of contrast, and at theend of the day, still me. That chairisn't permanent. I have another chairover there, but um yeah, it's just kindof here for now. Every time I've donelike an all-white setup or a mostlyblacked out setup, it didn't well, itlooked cool, but it didn't really feellike me. This This feels like me. If youremember my original setups, there was alot of black and white contrast. I thinka lot of people try to go for one or theother. The white and the black justcontrast so well. More minimalistic yetstill unique and interesting. Let meknow you think and appreciate you guysfor watching. I'll work on a studio tour","i think the desk legs are upside down, that metal bar going across the floor is supposed to lay under the top part of the desk so it wont sag

I share vlogs, bookish content, and gaming streams🖤✨","Hey, what's up? Hello. My name is Alexisand welcome to today's video where we'regoing to be doing a bit of a gaming desksetup refresh. I've had this gaming roomset up for about a year now and we'vegone through some transformations forthe room itself, but my setup behind mehas actually stayed the same for acouple years now. My main monitor behindme I got about 3 years ago, and thismonitor right here, I actually got in2016 because my grandmother gave me aBest Buy gift card. So, I think it wastime for a new monitor. So, that's whatthe main thing is going to be. So, I gota brand new monitor and I'll have thedetails of that here, as well as someother fun little accessories that I got.I'm also really excited because I gotthese monitor arms that like the swivelones that go on the desk. So, I'll beable to get rid of this thing that themonitor is sitting on, which will clearup a lot of space. So, without furtherado, let's go ahead and start cleaningoff this desk. I want a fresh startbefore I start unboxing everything.[Music]I am already very overwhelmed.[Music]Okay, so I'm an idiot and I thought mycurrent monitor had the the capabilitiesof getting one of these heers onto theback of it because I swear I bought oneof these monitor stands before, like theVessa swivel monitor things before, andit would fit on the white one on mymonitor, but it wouldn't fit on the oldone. So, I returned it, but now this onedoesn't fit. So, I'm justI'm so confused. So,[Music]I got it to stay up. I literally had toput all my strength into that. Like myass was on this desk tighteningit. Okay, it's too far that way, whichmeans I need to move this more to theleft.Imagine[Music]I don't even like this monitor and Iwent through all this pain andsuffering.These screws,let me These screws are very long. I'mgoing to bring my old monitor back uphere. genuinely hope for the best beforeI have a mental breakdown.It works. It works. Oh my god, it works.Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.I literally Alexis Delarman Rodriguez.Um, my stepfather taught me how to weldand drive a forklift at the age ofseven. I don't know why I ever doubtedmyself. So you see how this ridge ishere. So the screw fits herelike from outside cuz obviously thiscannot go in the circle. The squarecannot go in the circle hole. But theseare way down here. We're back to squareone. Like yeah, there is no way. Knowhow that screw is reaching down there.I was so close. So close. Whateveryou do in life, just make sure you don'tquestion how I did this.Okay.Okay.Got to figure out how to make thisvertical portrait.Yes, sir. I did it. I did it. I did it.Okay. I think this needs to go up. Needto go up a little. I don't know why, butI think this looks kind of bad.Let me put the rest of it together. Letme put the rest of it together. Nextthing is going to be a new mouse pad.Actually, I should probably clean thearea first.Next thing is this monitor light. Okay.Slay. Slay. I like that. Okay. think ofthat, I can confidently say that thiswhole setup has taken 10 years off of mylife. All right, here's the new monitor.I definitely have to play with somesettings because it doesn't lookfantabulous.Here's my second monitor that used to bemy main monitor. It's now vertical. Gotrid of the stand so I have more room formy mouse pad. This is a Keyron K8, Ibelieve, that my boyfriend built for mea couple years ago. This is the LogitechG705 mouse from the Aurora collection.Aurora Aurora collection. Here is theQuintis light bar that I got off ofAmazon. I forgot what this little keypadfellow is, but I use them whenever Iplay Supermarket Simulator, which Ihaven't done in a while. This microphoneI use for streaming. I have no idea whatit's called, but it's not plugged incurrently because the wire has to runfrom there all the way over here, and Idon't feel like showing that right now.and I did tie it all together. I have a1080p Logitech webcam. No idea what thisis called. Don't know where it camefrom, but it's here. Yeah, here's theupdated little setup. Now, I'm alsohappy with how it looks. Everything isjust more sleek. Definitely not thisside of my desk. Need to work on thatnext. And definitelynot back there. My god, that will haveto be a project for tomorrow. For rightnow, I am going to count this as a win.and that genuinely stressed me out and Ithought I was going to have a mentalbreakdown and just start crying. But wedid it. If you made it to this part ofthe video, I really appreciate you forsticking around. But if you did enjoythe video, please leave a like. Let meknow down in comments what you think ofthe new refresh. And also subscribe ifyou're new. Also, I'm sorry for thereally weird lighting. I need to fixthat.","THE SETUP LOOKS SO GOOD!!!

Singlemonitor, side by side, and even thevertical setup. But my favorite is this.Stacked monitors felt a bit strange atfirst, but honestly, it just makes moresense for how I work. So, my main stuffstays on the bottom. Editing, writing,anything I'm actively focused on. And onthe top screen, that's where I putthings like my music, notes, stuff thatI don't need all the time, but wantnearby. And a single screen was clean,but I'd always run out of space. So, thestacked setup works best for me. And no,I don't have to break my neck. It's allin my view.","I prefer stacked as well. However, having your 2nd monitor that high is a recipe for neck pains and problems. I like a tablet sized monitor below my eye level and first monitor.
I use and prefer a stacked steup as well. Two 34"" Curved ultra wide.
also prefer stacked, however I'm running a laptop and use the keyboard. My main screen being the external
This looks awesome!
I have this dual monitor setup but not by choice lol, just how my current space works. My ideal is a main, one side by side, and another vertical
Yes! I love my stacked monitor setup. Couldn’t go back to anything else.
I just have discord on the stacked screen. But I have 3 screens. Work/games on my main and usually youtube on my side monitor. The stacked monitor is above my side monitor and it works really well for me.
what monitors do you use?
My setup as well.
I had this set up then recently went side-by-side with one ultra wide and a regular 27 inch and thinking about going back to this ASAP
really nice bro. I want to do the same screen setup now for coding.
Stacked life for me
Bro you camera work is clean. The video is so good. is this HDR the colours are so vibrant?
What desk is that?
Love the gray brick walls. Are they panels? Link?
your lighting looks so good! edited right?
stacked is best for me too, ordering a 2nd screen, what size are your monitors
If my two monitors were bigger than they are now I would also stack them.
Ты в курсе для чего нужны подлокотники?
Damn 
Bro your monitor?
I have an old T420, am I strange?
Yeah the monitors are superb! Are they tv’s or pc monitors?? And if you don’t mind, can I know the brand and models??
Why this short automatically increased brightness of my phone?
what scaling are you using at your main monitor?
Nice. What are the monitors and brace you use?
What kind of monitor arm do you use for your stack
what do you use to mount the monitors?
This is my setup as well
Strain in the eyes left the chat
Why just not have one 48"" OLED one
What monitor arm are you using ?
Is this tv or monitor ? Can you give all model name ?
Wallpaper pls
RIP Neck
I will literally subscribe on 3 accounts if you make a desk / room tour

Let's just say I'm a true homebody at heart. I'm 28 years old, love all things cozy. I'm currently obsessed with Palia and I'm so happy that you're here.\n\n⋆ New Video every Thursday ♡\n\n⋆ INFP | ☀️ ♓ | 🌙 ♏️ | ⬆️ ♋️ | eneagram 9\n\n ♡\n","[Music][Music]Hello friends, welcome or welcome back.I hope you're having a lovely time zone.In today's video, I'm going to be doinga tour of my gaming room. This isn'tjust my gaming room because I work fromhere, stream, edit, and then behind me,I do have a little book nook. So, I alsoread, do all of my cozy hobbies in thisroom. But, I've been getting a ton ofquestions on where my desk is from, mybookshelves, for example. So, I thoughtit might be helpful to have one videothat has all of that information. If youclicked on this video hoping for someinfo regarding what you may need for PCgaming or streaming, I just want to letyou guys know that you could definitelydo less than what I have. This is likeyears of upgrades. I started outstreaming specifically on an Xbox andalso a laptop. Crazy days. I'm verygrateful for the setup that I have now.If you would have told me I had this afew years ago, I never would havebelieved you. Honestly, little likeyounger me would be crying knowing thatI have the space that I do, and I'm sograteful for that. I just don't wantanybody to feel like they need to havethis thing in order to stream. I'm alsogoing to try to have as many links as Ican below. If I'm missing anything thatyou really would like, just comment downbelow and I'll try to find the link. Butif it's not down below, I probably can'tfind it somewhere. I think this intro islong enough. I say let's get into thetour. When you first walk into myoffice, I have this small nook where Ihave some storage. I have a little floorcabinet that holds my Cricut, somehobbies, my printer, pens, and a fewframes. To the left of that, I have aKiki's Delivery Service print that I gotfrom Etsy. And right across the door, Ihave an acrylic calendar that I got fromAmazon. The cabinet is from Wayfair.It's called the Elany Hall TwodoorAccent Cabinet. What I love most aboutit are those scalloped edges on thedoor, but honestly, it holds quite a bitof stuff, and I am liking this extrastorage in my room so far. Beside thatnook, I have a full-length mirror. Ibelieve I got this from either Walmartor Amazon. I can't remember. And then inthis corner, this is where I keep a lotof my filming equipment. So, I have mylight and my camera. For both filmingand streaming, I use the Canon Rebel T3iwith a 50 mm lens. This camera is soold. I'm actually very grateful thatit's still working and I will be usingit until it dies on me. As for the lens,I don't know if I would recommend it100% because you can't zoom in with it.However, it does create a beautifulbokeh. So, if you're here for theaesthetics, this might be a good lensfor you. Now, before we get into thepretty side of my office, we're going togo ahead and get into my PC specs. Iwill say my husband built this PC forme. He built it. He found all the parts.He is the one to credit for thisbeautiful build. I just game. I'm just agirl. So, if I butcher any of thesenames, I am so sorry. My case is byFractal Design and it's a Torrent case.My graphics card is a Radeon RX7900 XTX.My CPU is a Ryzen 7 7800X3D.My motherboard is a B650 Orus Elite. MyRAM is a GSkill 32 GB DDR5. I have aNoctua CPU cooler and my power source isa Corsair 850 and I'll have all thatinformation down below. This PC gets methrough streaming, some more fast-pacedgames like Overwatch, Fortnite,Valerant, but it's also able to play allof my Sims custom content and myMinecraft mods. So, this PC is basicallymy best friend. I love her so much. Andshe sits on a PC stand from Amazon.Okay, moving on. My desk is from Wayfairand it's a Hadlock executive desk. Ireally loved the curved design to it. Italso hides my cables well enough so Ican just forget about them. I never haveto worry about them. As for my chair,it's a Verve chair from Branch Furniturein the color wheat. This is a neweraddition to my office and I amabsolutely obsessed with it. I love thecolor so much and it's actually quitecomfortable. I have no complaints as ofnow. Both of my monitors are from ASUS.The vertical one is an ASUS Rockstricks27 in QHD monitor and the horizontal oneis an Asus tough gaming 27 in HDRmonitor. I also added electrical tape toboth of them just to have that whitemonitor look without spending the money.I would love white monitors eventually,but they're a little out of my budget.And they both sit on a dual monitorstand by Pixio. Sitting above mymonitor, I have a Logitech Liter Glowstreaming light. I've had this foryears. It's given me no issues and Ihighly recommend. My mic is a sure MV7and my mic arm is from Amazon. The brandis called Brennan and both my mic and mymic arm were gifts from my community.So, thank you so much for that again.Moving on to my desk, I have a Go XLRthat sits underneath an acrylic standfrom Amazon. And I also have my Switch 2right here. I think I'm going to bemoving this though, but for now, this isits home. Beside that, I have my StreamDeck Plus. And I mostly use this forstreaming. I'll use the buttons forswitching scenes. There's a lot that youcan do with these. I definitely don'tuse mine to its highest potential. Icustomized it with a little cover fromEtsy and I also switched out the knobsfor the gold ones just because I thoughtit matched my space a little bit better.Beside my stream deck, I have a traythat's from World Market and it holds afew different things. Right now, I havemy Amazon Echo Show 5 and it's in cloudblue. I mostly use this to play lowfimusic. One thing that my setup islacking is speakers. That's something Iwant to add eventually. I just don'tknow which ones I want to add, so I needto do a little bit more research. Nextto that, I have a little glass jar fromIKEA. This is where I keep my earbudsand usually some random USBs that I havelaying around. And then I also charge myphone on this tray. As for my keyboard,I use a Glorious 60% compact. I've hadthis keyboard for years and it hasn'tfailed me once. I think the colors arepretty easy to change, but in thefuture, I would really love to make acustom keyboard. I just know that once Iopen that door, I'm probably never goingto stop. So, I'm waiting until theperfect time to actually make a customkeyboard. Then, for my mouse, I use aSteel Series A3. I've had two of these.I've used the wired and the wireless,and I've loved both. I think it's greatif you like more fast-paced shootergames. It's also quite comfortable ifyou prefer games on the cozier side. Andthen my mouse pad is from Etsy. Etsy ismy go-to whenever I'm wanting a newmouse pad. They always have such cutedesigns. On the other side of my desk, Ijust kind of keep some random stuff. Ihave all my journals. I have a cup fullof pens and I also keep my headphonesover here. When it comes to my audio, Iuse a Logitech G735wireless gaming headset. This is fromthe Aurora line. I absolutely love thisheadset. I would recommend getting itwhen it's on sale though because I thinkit could be quite pricey. And I amsomebody who wears glasses, so sometimesthe headphones can get kind ofuncomfortable after wearing it for along period of time. Whenever thathappens, I also use the Logitech Gits.Above my desk, I have this shelf, and Ibelieve it's from Lowe's. Up here, Ihave a few different prints. That blueone was a gift from a friend. The twolarger frames are from HomeGoods. Andthen for the wavy frame, that's actuallya mirror I got from TJ Maxx. I thoughtit would be cool to glue a photo in thecenter, and I think it looks prettycool. And then I also decorated withsome candles. I have a jelly cat and afake plant from Lowe's. Under my desk, Ihave a rug from Lowe's and a cute dogbed from Amazon. I love this dog bed somuch. The green color is justperfection. And one of my favoriteaspects of my gaming area is mylighting. I absolutely love ambientlighting. Most of the lighting thatyou're seeing here is from GOI. I'llhave the exact ones down below. On thewall, I have a GOI neon rope light. Onthe floor below my desk and also behindmy monitor, I use the Go light bars. Onthe back side of my desk, I have anotherGo neon rope light. And then themushroom on my desk isn't from Go V. I'mpretty sure I got it from Michaels.However, you can find these cute littlemushroom lights everywhere. That is itfor the gaming side of my hobby room.And now we're moving on to my readingnook. The main focal point of my officeis definitely this bookshelf. It is fromWayfair and it's the Marley bookcase.One of my favorite aspects of thisbookcase is the fact that there'sstorage on the bottom half. So in thereI have all of my arts and crafts, someof my tech stuff. I would show you, butit's a little messy. So, we're going toavoid that for now. On my bookshelves, Ihave most of my favorite books. I am ahuge fantasy reader. Fantasy is myfavorite genre, especially if it's aromanty. So, I have most of thosedisplayed on this bookshelf. The restare in my living room. Other than mybooks, I have some lights, and I have alot of random knick-knacks like Legos,candles, Zelda figures. It's just abookshelf that holds a lot of myfavorite things. To the right of mybookshelf is my reading chair, which Ilove so much. I feel like I've said thatabout so many items in this space, butthis space truly makes me happy. So, Ithink it's important to find items thatyou love. But this chair is from Costco.It is a Holly oversized fabric accentchair. But I read in this chair.Sometimes I work from it. My pets loveit as well. My dogs will use it as abed. So will my cats. It's just theultimate cozy chair. On top of thechair, I have some throw pillows. Thedog one is from Urban Outfitters. Thatone is my favorite. To the right of myreading chair, I have a little cart thathas some random stuff, but it's mostly alittle snack cart. It has easy snacksthat I can grab for whenever I'm readingor gaming. And that cart is from Amazon.Above my reading nook, I have thislittle wall gallery. This is my mostrecent project in this space and I'mreally happy with it. The frames arekind of all over. Some of them are fromHomeGoods, others TJ Maxx, and I've alsothrifted a few as well. All of theprints are from Etsy. Etsy is my go-tofor prints. Pretty much all the printsin my space are from Etsy. And that isit for my gaming, reading, and hobbyroom tour. I love this space so much. Itbrings me so much comfort. This room ismy safe zone. It is my safe space and Ihad a lot of fun sharing it with youguys. So, thank you so much for beinghere. If you have any questions, leavethem down below. I'm going to try tohave all the links down there as well.But, thank you for spending some timewith me today.

isthe world's largest gaming monitor as Itry to build the largest gaming setupyou have ever seen some of these itemsyou won't find in any other setup like a98 in TV or maybe a PC so heavy it takestwo of us to carry and so much more butif I really want to build somethingmassive I have six items I need to orderstarting with the keyboard world'slargest gaming keyboard wow I'mabsolutely butchered that one red dragonk605 this thing is absolutely massive itis 200% the size of regular keyboards atthe cart so next we gothuge huge gaming desk okay hear me outhow big are the Ikea butcher blocksfirst time ever spelling somethingapparently okay hear me out Quin whathappens if we build one on the front oneon the left one on the right to make aU-shaped desk going to put togetherthree desks to make one Mega desk addthecart right huge mouse wow pretty bigmice well then this this might be itthis might be it I mean at least we gotan ergonomic design but bro look how bigthis is on her hand add the cart allright but for our main monitor I know wealready have the TV downstairs it ispart of theirxl90 line any true gaming setup doesn'tonly have one monitor it has a secondarymonitor so that's where we're going togo you got a bunch of 49 in oleds onthere Odyssey Neo but we want somethingbigger what about the Odyssey art sothis thing is coming in at 55 in 4k 165HZ I mean at this point you might aswell just classify that as a TV add tocard we got a lot of power in thisgameing sets the most important we gotto find a massive PC let me see here 10biggest cases in 2025 so I have beenreading a lot about this one so it's theCorsair9000d so as you can see it can fit up to18 fans accommodates six ssds five hddsthis thing actually before you build itit weighs in at 65 lb and they have anestimate once you get this fully loadedit's over 100 lb just for the PC casedud look at that look how much roomwe're going to have in that okay epicart 500 bucks for just a PCcase this is great how much have youspent so far well you were supposed tohave the money tracker above us oh sorryyeah put that up thank you now that wehave the PC case we just need to finishbuilding out the PC and since we'realready on corsair's website I'm goingto go ahead and grab a power supply anaiio some RAM and all 18 fans for thiscase but don't worry we still have thetwo most important pieces being an theI9 14900 k and a 4090 graphics card Idon't think I've ever seen moneydisappear from my wallet as fast as itdid right there but thankfully all weneed to wait for is for all this to shipout now I think this setup is going tobe a tad bigger than what we'reexpecting I mean we did get our 18 fansin here you got the 55in Odyssey Arc butthere's one thing that I have to mentionis whenever your PC case says carefulit's heavy and on the side it says itrequires a team lift you know things aregoing to get a little crazyoh wow what a PC case this PC buildscares me though because between a 98 in4K TV as our main monitor to oursecondary monitor being a 55 in 4kdisplay I don't know how this PC isgoing to hold up but before we get tothe build I have to give a huge shoutout to Corsair for partnering with us onthis video because they ended up sendingus a piece C case a power supply Ram AIOand don't worry we didn't forget aboutthefans oh crap and just in case youwondering 10 12 14 16 18 plus yourradiator plus three fans on the GPUthat's you're going to have like 25 fansin this thing but the final spec listboast that this is one of the fastestPCS that you can build right now I meanbetween a 14900 K processor to 4090 GPUand clocking in with 64 GB of ddr5 RAM Idon't think this puppy will have anyissues handling multiple 4K displays nowthat we tested the PC and we got it onon the very first try you're going tohave to trust me on that one we're goingto take it back down build the rest ofthe setup now you may be wondering toyourself man it looks a little bitdarker like the sun kind of went downand wow they installed the secret gamingroom entrance doors no we weren't uphere that long we literally justfinished clearing out the entire livingroom here in the gaming house so youguys better like this video Andsubscribe but now we got to add in thebase of it the gaming desk now to standout from your overused typical Ikeagaming desk we put three of these badboys together to make sure we had enoughspace for this massive setup well nowthat we got the desks all set up thatonly means one thing it's time to getthis party started and get our gamingsetup on it first up is our Shack sizedkeyboard and like I mentioned earlierthis keyboard is 200% larger than yournormal keyboards how am I supposed touse like w ASD to move and jump but nextup we got the massive scroll wheel ofdeath now I would be lying to you if Ididn't say this piece of the setupscares me the most because it doesn'tmove like an ordinary Mouse but ratheryou use this big red ball right here tomove your cursor around which is goingto make my life miserable trying toscroll across two massive displays thatwe just installed combining for153 in of displays just because I don'tthink you guys realize how big thiskeyboard is this is you this is the guyshe tells you not I mean I'm so sorrynow that we got our peripherals andmonitors installed it's time for themain event the PC but let me remind younow that we have the PC fully built outit is weighing over 100 lb I mean it'sso large you can fit a whole other PCinside of it and not to mention it makesall the components inside lookabsolutely tiny and I would like toremind you guys this is a 4090 in thisbuild it doesn't get any bigger thanthat but this is where we ran into ahuge issue as we were getting everythingconnected I realized that both the TVand the Odyssey Arc monitor were HDMIports and the graphics card that'scurrently in my PC only has one HDMIplugin so after hours of trying tofigure out a solution we ended upconnecting everything through theSamsung hub which I know sounds like asimple solution but as we were trying toget this connected the Samsung hub didnot want to display both monitors to myPC but let me tell you guys wherethere's a will there's a way so we wereable to figure it all out and still ableto use the main TV for our game and ofcourse have that ultimate brain rot ofSubway Surfers on the secondary monitorall right it's the moment we've all beenwaiting for it has been hours the sunhas set it is literally dark outside butwe have the entire setup ready to go sothe last thing we got to do is puteverything to the test and see if we canactually just get one kill I know mostof the challenges are like hey can youwin a game of fortnite no if you don'tsee that Mouse over there and thatkeyboard we're going for one kill to seeif anything in this setup is actuallypractical now we have been talkingNon-Stop about how big this setup wasbut I didn't realize how difficult thiswas going to be a game on it until I satdown I mean the keyboard itself was sobig I could barely press two keys at thesame time and don't you dare even get mestarted on this mouse pray for me Joelgreater or lesser than 3% that I get akill on the first drop in probablylesser but I'm glad you have so muchconfidence in me oh my gosh dude are wedropping boys I'm not even worried I'mnot even worried we're getting a solid30 frames up there so do you feel likeyou're at the advantage absolutely not DI can hardly press e to pick up a weaponon this thing oh mygosh this is so bad I think this is abottoo 3% my rear end did I go against abot just maybe but now that I haveconquered our first obstacle of seeingif I can actually get a kill on thisthing let's see how the rest of thematch goes my hands are cramping up Idon't know if I can finish the wholegame I can't even go and press m for themap look I can't run and press M Iliterally my pinkies cramping pressingshift oh they don't even know you knowwhat I think we're just going to go forthe win that's it this setup isUN that really went differently in myhead all right if we were to categorizethis entire setup to least the best I'mgoing to go the worst thing in the setupit's the mouse that thing is unusablebut then that keyboard I mean the factthat I was like literally trying get mypinky to hit shift to run not usable PCTV monitor I mean all these things arestuff that people normally use overallthe setup I probably won't be playing onit again just because of how impracticalthe screen size is also but if you guysare looking for a screen size that isplayable make sure to check out mymonitor video here but we'll see you onthe next one,"0:37 dilido toys is crazy
RIP electricity bill
For a house that size, you definitely need a setup like this.
This setup remembers me off when I was a child and how I saw the world
I'm just glad there's someone on YouTube to test the set ups that us people say what if
We see that search history
5:53 Bro forgot about the chair
I am a first time viewer but i actually love this, i loved the vid and everything but i would recommend if you could use it as a racing simulator with the huge screen it would be amazing. That’s all best of wishes!
No big chair :(
that PC is actually insane - amazing video brother
i would be sleeping on the couch if i purchased these lol
You know when small kids use adult size stuff and you're all like ""aww how cute!"" 
Ridiculously fun to watch you pain through it haha
Also the gaming house looks beautiful bro!
3:38 just in CASE (pun?)
W chair
2:42 bro a 4090 from ebay
0:37 human [______] is crazy
-Wants to build a ""massive"" pc

*doesn't buys a threadripper

Nah man, that's not going to be massive at all
Wow this was MASSIVE! it really got my LOW expectations high, and made my views on a normal PC TAPER and FADE
Tiny Chair ?
7:26 You had your fps locked
What about the 50 series?
+99 missed calls from shaq
Why 30fps with 4090?
6:25 The largest chair?!
Underrated channel, you definitely deserve more subs
trackballs, for those not used to them, do take a bit of time to get adjusted to. And like gaming mice, they also have adjustable DPS settings which would make it easier to use.. i hope you didnt give up on it.. Personally, I want someone.. ANYONE.. to make a gaming capable clone of the old $20 Logitech Trackman Marble (the slightly larger than a normal mouse with the trackball in the center front, and buttons on either side of the ball.) I get Gameball makes one, but $200 for one isn't in my price range

i get the theme of the video was biggest everything. but I have to guess you did swap back to a standard sized KB and mouse afterwards
The min Fan Speed was never more important
This reminds me of MrWho’sTheBoss really cool! Little expensive though lol
Just my thoughts. 

Not the largest gaming PC setup and less enjoyable than other options. Start with modular displays that have high pixel density. Expensive yes, but when there is a problem you replace a part instead of replacing everything. Also can always add/remove panels or create a non standard display shape (can be useful).

As for the PC setup itself. Start with motherboard stands and mount to the frame of modular screen setup, creating custom mounts for pc parts (video cards, HDs, extension cards, etc.) with standoffs and aluminum extrusions. Hide HID pref cabling in the display frame to the desktop and a single cable to a dock or USB extensions for dongles.
the tower 900 here! maxed out. my pc weighs 100 pounds. my monitor is the acer predator 43 inch and I'm running klipsch 12 inch 600 watts subwoofer with monitors at 200 watts. Welcome aboard to the massive pc users.
0:17 did you say Massive
wOw!!! that's a dream set-up for me. Thanks for sharing...
Put a Mini ITX parts into this case.
Should ran dual 5090s that woulda been INSANE
Aside for the cool setup you've got an amazing physique man congrats !
why no Ryzen i9 processor????
this video deserves way more views and likes
this setup is very MASSIVE. just like my LOWWWWW TAPERRRRR FADEEEEEEE
@5:35 this is just embarrassing as a pc builder
Why not amd? r9 9900x?
surprised you didn't go with threadripper. 64 core 7980X is the obvious choice
Calling a trackball a mouse 

But in all reality, switching from mouse to trackball comes with a decent learning curve, especially to an office/productivity one like the Ellecom Huge. Ellecom's Deft Pro has much better ergonomics for gaming!
I'm gonna lie bro, this is sick
You could make a beast pc with this massive case
8:30 Normalyyyyyyy!!!! Huhhhhh Bro i have a 2060
We got shaq's gaming setup revealed 
Btw love the vids
That PC ain't having heat problems for a entirety
Ngl this deserves more views
I just saw this same big monitor at Best Buy and would definitely buy this if I could
Bigger does not equal better. I find it much harder to take everything in on a monitor that's too big for my field of vision.
holy crap how is this video and channel so underrated
This guy deserves more views this was a very expensive build
Nah the electricity bills abt to be wildin
BRO YOU’RE MISSING THE WORLDS BIGGEST CHAIR ??..?
I’m tryna get that desk!! Where is that from!?
I have the odyssey ark too , I need to hit the gym cause u lifted it up on the desk like it was nothing
It looks like you made a mini itx build in an atx case
why no one on youtube has made a comparison video of odyssey ark with other odyssey models... its so confusing at this point. the only plus point for me in odyssey g9 is that it has oled , other than that everything is better in odyssey ark... can you pleaseeeee make a comparison video of comparing other monitors with odyssey ark? pls pls pls there is no one else on yt who can afford it ig
Where’s the chair!
am i tripping or did you pair a 750w psu with an i9 and 4090?! the 14900k alone pulls like 500w.
Lol that massive setup with a little stool
Damn bro 
Its worth the watch but damn
Prices be much
Imagine donating 1/10 of all expenses to one minor YouTuber
why not a 9800 x3d
How could the largest gaming setup not have a projector to project an IMAX-size screen?
3:34 One man, a lot of fans challenge
This is the kind of setup that Shaquille O'Neal would have
you should put a smart bulb so you can change the colour of the room and then it will look like a gaming room
BRO IS GONE MAD
Insanely Outstanding....
New fan here..
Your videos are so amazing sir. Keep it up for making new contents ..
My pc case is about half size and it takes at least two people to lift it. Imagine how many people it takes to move this
Whynnot get a display port to HDMI adapter/cable? It took me 2 mins to figure that out when i first started with my rx 580
Bro that setup was Massive
Bro forgot about the 5090
Video Is Good obv
But His Arms got me inspiration !
Give this gaming set up to Shaquille
You forgot the hugest gaming chair buddy.
great video !!!
why not a threadripper?
next time use a cable with HDMI on one end and Display on the other.

Every time I come acrossa useful desktop gadget in form of amacro pad, you know, I'll check it out.This is the Hagibus knob, a USBC dockingstation that has a bunch of ports andhubs built in, letting you simplify acrowded desk setup into a streamlined,compact hub with some extrafunctionality. So, checking it out, thehub first and foremost features theobvious, that big old knob. If you don'thave like a desktop amp DACK at thesetup already or some sort of volumedial to your peripherals, this offersvolume adjustment and muting your audio.But the surrounding four corners arealso buttons letting you lock yourdisplay or turn it off, take ascreenshot, and control the built-in RGBas the knob has this like ring glowinginside of it. Then the backside featureseight additional ports, all acting as apass through. So great for plugging inthings like, you know, a hard drive,your peripherals, headphones, anexternal monitor. And with a hub likethis, it's definitely designed andintended to be used most with like yourlaptop setup. Because with it being socompact, you know, you can have justeverything plugged into the back ofhere, external monitor out, and nowcontrol your entire laptop setup justfrom this tiny little hub. But ofcourse, it's not just for the laptop.You can use it with your gaming setup aswell. It's still going to offer youthose same benefits of functionality.And you can keep it tucked away, butstill, you know, at an arms reach tochange up the volume or take a quickscreenshot. Now, as of recording this,there is no software or way to adjustwhat those four face buttons do. I'msure someone savvy out there can createa script or something to change them up,but that's why those display buttons aremainly made for, you know, laptops andthat in mind. But for me, having thosebuilt-in SD card readers is clutch. AndI can just plug in my other drives onthe back, charge my phone at the sametime with the 100 watt port. All comingin right at 50 bucks for this, which isa really good price. That volume knobalso going to be great if you're a bigmusic head. So bear with me for a",

the chairs did infact smell good and you know what theywere easy to put together as well we didthem in about 15 minutes but none ofthat really matters if they're notcomfortable to sit on okay me and Adamhave both built our chairs Let's testout if we're going to use them let'sgo o now this is all right this is all ylook at this this is actually all rightohW oh this is good oh man I can fallasleep

andarsupport with 3D coordinated armreststhese chairs are going to lookabsolutely incredible in this setup andif you want to check any of them outI'll leave a link in the descriptionlike I said this is going to be the mostexpensive setup I've ever made so thankssee who for sponsoring this video ofmaking this happen now to round off thefirst day I added some extra support tothe mega desk and I also stuck up these3D art panels however this literallytook me all night it was really worth itthough as I feel like they give the rooma bit of depth and even though the roomstarted to actually look good it didn'tstop me from attempting to put up ashelf before I went to bed okay um it is1: in the morning I don't know if youcan tell in my voicebut I'm really tired so I'm going tosleep and carry on in themorning now on the start of day two meand Adam started to build another deskbecause believe it or not this roomisn't going to just have two setups it'sgoing to have three I'll explain lateranyways it was time to add the rest ofthe shelves look at that like a gloveright now I'm actually combining twodifferent types of Ikea shelves to getlike this really thick shelving designis that what you would call it like alike a thick shelf I don't know I had tocut some of the shelves to make them fitbut once we had done that all thefurniture was completed which means wecould move on tolighting however not all of the stuffthat I've ordered has arrived yethowever we've still got quite a few toputup yeah we're going to fill this roomwith pretty much the craziest lightingI've ever put in any room so let's putthem[Music]in this is literally just the first oneI reckon it will look even better when Iturn theseoffoh my this is one light one light I'vegot like 10 to 15 more this is going tolook good anyways the next light to addwas this crazy desk light that I couldput all the way around the deskoh my God we've only put two lights onright now I I could stop here and itwould still look incredible this isgoing to be the best setup I've evermade I can just tell but if I actuallywant to make this the best room thatI've ever made I need to get rid of oneof the worst things about thisroom the biglight you see if I just turn off everysingle light in here and I put on thelightswitch do you see what I mean it just itjust looks horrible I genuinely thinkthis might be one of the worst thingsmankind has ever invented I mean there'sthere is a few other things obviouslybut um top three at least so one I'vegot here is a Phillips hue light switchwhich is basically the exact same thingbut it's a uh a color changing bulb so Ijust get rid of thisone I should beable to change it to different colors Ibought this ginormous lamp from Ikearight when you put on it oh waa it umyeah it doesthat oh my God just like that the roomwas completely transformed with just afew lights it's honestly giving mespaceship sort of Vibes right now but Istill want to make this room better umI'm whispering because I want to stayquiet so Emily can't hear me butrealistically um I need to make thisroom look as good as possible cuz umgenuinely this Channel's success wouldnot have happened without her like someof you may know thatI've wanted to do YouTube since I was 11years old because of Emily I am nowdoing that she's generally made mydreams come true so I just want to beable to surprise her with this likecrazy room um for her birthday I need Ineed it to be good so I'm going to workthrough the night I'm going to put upsome more lights and yeah overall I feellike we've made some very good progressfor day[Music]two hello my friends it is day three andI have currently spent around about 90%of today just waiting around for Amazon[Music]packagescheers thank you very much forthat oh my God there is so many packageslet's take these upstairs because theAmazon delivery was so late it now meansthat we've got even less time to finishthis sowe really need to getstarted more lightssoundproofing next light is in O itgenuinely just keepsgetting it just keeps getting better andbetter now there was only one more Setof Lights to put up however I might havemade a slight miscalculationI I don't have enough I'm currentlybuying some and they will arrivetomorrow it just means that I'm I'mreally cutting it close so since we'reputting Lighting on hold right now weneed to move on with some other thingsnow this room currently has a problemwhen youclap there there's a bit of an echo so Ineed to reduce that by putting up theseuh foam acoustic panels so I stuck themonto the wall and not only did it givethe wall a nice design the echo was alsomassively reduced but now let's add the[Music]monitors we have got the monitor arms onwhich now means we've got to add somemonitors to them and uh let's just say Imight have gone a little bit Overkillbecause not only do we have one monitorI didn't just get two I didn't get justthree I didn't get just four I didn'tget just five I have got us six monitorsthat is three monitors each and a a lotofelectricity rip my bank account now forpeople who love Tech the top twomonitors here are 4K 27 in monitors 144Herz and all the rest are just normal27in 1080p monitors that are going to beused for other things so let's get theseopen that is nice[Music]nice and that is the six monitor this isreally starting to come along now on areal one though it isapproaching midnight uh I know I wassuper hyped to put these monitors up butnow I just know I havegot a lot to clean up likejust look at all this rubbish man I wantto go to bed butI'm going to keep doing this forly I'mgoing to just now tidy this entire placeoffand I'll see you guys in the[Music]morning good morning everyone it is dayfour and um let's just say right now Iam getting a little bit conscious oftime becauseum not everything has all right I wastaking a walk with Emily earlier and Iasked her what is the one thing thatshe's kind of really expecting from thiswhole setup and she said as long as Iget a PC considering you gave my lastone away to a subscriber it's finelisten I'll get you a new pc it'll bethe best PC you've everseen they haven't arrived yet andEmily's birthday is in 2 days however umsome other stuff did arrive today whichis the Nano Leaf lights and some moremonitor arms so at least we've gotsomething to work on today so I startedadding the extra monitor arms and justas i f I was making someprogress okay we have a slight problemum I've realized there's not there's nota lot of like leg room here I can onlyjust barely fit in this place theproblem is I've used Too Many Alexdrawers and I've got to get rid of onewithout the entire setup collapsing ohthat nearly messed everything up I'mpretty much playing the setup equivalentof Jenga I don't like this apart from ifI mess up here Emily is not going tohave any monitors you guys have no ideahow tricky this is in the end though Imanaged it the next thing on my to-dolist is to fix the Nano Leafpanels okay the lights now should be alldone so let's plug themin yo oh myGod this this generally might be thebest setup I have honestly ever made Iam so happy right now we've only justnow completed the lighting stage so ifthat crossed off the the list we'reactually on track to finishing thisbefore Emily's birthday let me justconfigure these and we can finally TurnAll the Lights On but it's when Istarted configuring them that we hadanother problem okay we havea a serious serious problem trying toget the Nano Leaf lights to sink up tomy phone they just won't work the oneson the right here just seem to be faultyas I spent the past 3 hours trying toset them up but they just wouldn't workI even went into my garage to see ifthere was any on Leaf lights but I foundnothing basically now midnight Iliterally spentlike 7 hours trying to get them all toconnect and link up and it just won'twork I've done it hundreds of timesbefore I've been on literally everyReddit post I've been on every onlineform just trying to figure out I'm justgoing to have to um sort lighting out onthe final day then I[Music]guess it is the last day before Emily'sbirthday so I've got basically all oftoday to try and finish off this room Idon't really know if everything's goingto arrive today but judging by the waythings are going I might have to try andextend the deadline to like later in theday on her birthday but yeah we we'vegot to get started now today is the daywhere we add in basically all of thegaming setup accessories I've got somany things to add in here first thingwe're putting in is these white speakersthat match perfectly with the setup andthen we've also got these matchingWireless Logitech headphones this isprobably the most expensive setup I'vemade because everything that I have tobuy I have to buy two of them we've evengot some Led headset stands so thatthese headsets have a place to sit we'veeven got a white microphone arm to gowith a brand new sha mv7 whitemicrophone now we're not really usingthis for gaming it's going to be morefor voiceovers like the one you'rehearing now in fact this is the exactmicrophone that I'm currently speakinginto and you can probably tell I sound alot better anyway now it's time forkeyboards now for me I've gone with thislike I don't even know what it's calledH I75 I don't even know I saw itand itjust oh and it's white and blue so Ithought it would be perfect for Emily'skeyboard we're going with this pink epermaker one which I put in her last setupbut it's it's that good we've got to putit in this one and for the mouse we'regoing with the best mouse in the worldthe MX Master 3s again though I've hadto get two of these which is um uh thisvideo has been so expensive I tookanother shot of trying to fix thelighting on the wall but then I had anunexpected guest[Music]arrive oh look who decided to turn up ohM oh I missed it I missed a little bitof this haven't I just a bit yeah comeand help me out man what's your what'syour first impressions thisis so clean now remember when I saidearlier that I was building a thirdsetup we still need to add things intothat as it's currentlywell it hasn't got anything in it sowe've actually got a Mini PC that'sgoing in here nice little Keyon keyboardhypx mouse speakers and you know how Ialso said earlier that I'd got sixmonitors that was a a lie again I gotseven so that that's the seventh monitornow oh God this setup is purely going tobe used for dumping Youtube footage ontoand it's also going to be a spare setupif anyone else wants to game with us butanyways forget about that Emily's new PChas just arrived this is Emily's PC butwe actually do have another one of thesecoming the problem is I ordered thesePCS on separate dates so we do haveanother one of these coming you're justgoing to have to imagine right now thatthere is another one right here becausethere is one coming now these PCS aretough of the line I went all out on thespecs of these mainly because I did giveEmily's last PC away to a subscriber butthis thing is is better than anythingshe's ever had before these are thespecs literally it's top of the line itit cost around about three grand andwe've got two of them anyways added somefinal touches like Emily's iPad andmicrophone and I even got us some customXbox Pro controllers these things areabsolutely insane we've never played onPro controllers before but just holdingthis thing in my hands I know 100% it'sgoing to enhance our gaming experienceand of course I've got myself a matchingone for myself and as we added them itbecame midnight it literally just becameEmily's birthday anduh she's just sat there editing Emily'sactually working on a video right nowwhich we want to make when we hit 500ksubscribers which will be to open thefirst ever free gaming store for a daywe really want to make this video so hitsubscribe if you want to see that happenanyways it's time for the final[Music]day now the Kickstart off the final daywe have had a huge delivery from theguys at technically stable these guyshonestly make some of the most craziestMouse mats I've ever seen in my life Imean just look at how cool that's goingto look in the setup oh that is perfectoh yes this is probably my favoriteMouse M design I've ever seen in my lifebut whilst I was showcasing off thismouse mat I Got a notification that Ihad been waiting for this entire week ohmy God okay dpd is here okay one secondoh my God I have to pause on the mousemap because my PC ishere yeah myfriend the second PC is here let's getit upstairs yes it's great news that thesecond PC has arrived however I need tostill show you guys these Mouse matsbecause I swear down to you these areprobably some of the best designed Mousemats I've ever seen in my life I feellike a lot of the time with mouse matsyou can't really see the artwork that isactually on them because a keyboard andmouse is usually covering it I feel likethis one is one of the cleanest designsI've ever seen and I've also got it inblue but just in case we don't want togo with that we've also got this designand we've also got this design what'samazing as well is they've sent out theother color variant so we can basicallyhave matching mouse pads as wellhonestly this is not sponsored but hugethank you to technically stable forsending out these however now it wastime to bring in my PC now this was sentout by PC specialist again not sponsoredbut if you guys want to sponsor me PCspecialist then uh I like your productsI I wouldn't say no but no I I did payfor this myself and my God is it heavybut also beautiful let's do the peelokay time for the big[Music]revealoh my God look at this I've never everseen a motherboard like that this isgenuinely so cool but we still weren'tdone with ading thing the setup stillneeded some plants one can go here onecan go here one can go here one here andone here and with that the setup wasnearly done done but there was one morething to fix so um the reason I've gotyou around is because I have got to takeEmily on a birthday dinner in like anhour and a half so we've basically justover an hour to make this room look assick as possible and then I also mightneed you to fix the nanola design soyeah we need to just get all of thatdone and then it's up to you you'veforgotten something though what look howtall you are I forgot you're you'resmaller and look how little I am just goon reach reach go onthis some small people problems sowhilst I took Emily for a deliciousbirthday meal Adam had to crack on andget the lights off the only problem wasoh my yeah no that's that's that's notgoing to happen I literally can't reachit happy birth toyou I've gotit once Adam had fixed the height issuehe had no problem getting the lights upoh my God they're on they've on they'reactually on now I I thought I'd brokenhalf of them with the lights finally upthe setup was now complete which isgreat considering I was about to walkthrough the door with Emily right okayguys um this room is now pretty muchdone so it's time to go showEmily Emily is it time it's time thishas been the biggest project I have everdone it's took me a week to build and Ihave spent so much money honestly I'vespent quite a lot on this video if anyof you guys could hit that like buttonjusthelp me out that would be veryappreciated there was a lot of problemsbut you know what the entire journey ofmaking this setup was extremely fun andnow I get to end off this video byshowing it to my favorite person in theworld I want you to remove yourblindfold infreetwoone open youreyes oh my God[Music]oh myGod this that actually looksincredible oh my God we've got matchingPC yeah like a new PC for you aswell that looks

much formaking it literally the perfect setuplike ever it's all right now my birthdayis literally in s days so like you knowwhat what are you gettingme uh[Applause],"What a sick video Dantic. Feel like I've been on the adventure with you the whole time, and the whole story with your fiance makes me feel the emotion you felt while making this room. 

I've been there so many times where everything goes so smoothly, until something goes wrong and then you're 8 hours deep with still no idea how to fix it, but good on you for persevering as the lighting looks amazing, especially that pendant! Sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to reveal the problem. I'm doing the same office renovation and it's just so tiring sometimes, up till 1am either painting or moving stuff around, so I can definitely empathise with the struggles and the toll it takes on you.

You certainly deserve way more subs, and I hope you make more of these videos in the future!
Glad to see that whilst being so kind to all these people he still treats himself and his girlfriend. Keep it up Dantic I'm loving the vids!
I remember from a previous vid that she liked the white better with only touches of pink and love that it got remembered (as an icon like Dan would lol). Happy late Birthday Emily!!
Hey Dantic!
Huge fan here I'm 27 and have always been passionate about gaming. Your content really speaks to people like me who dream big but are limited by what we have. Right now, I'm stuck using a GTX 2060, only 4GB RAM, a 500GB HDD, and a 650W PSU. It barely holds up for gaming, let alone learning video editing or streaming.

One of my biggest dreams is to start a YouTube channel — something where I can finally share my love for gaming and creativity. But the setup just isn’t there, and financially, upgrading hasn’t been possible for me.

If there’s ever a time you’re helping someone level up their setup, I’d be honored to be considered. Just having someone like you even read this means a lot. Your videos don’t just entertain — they motivate people like me to keep dreaming.

Much love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Keep doing what you do, you’re genuinely making a difference
CA$2.00 Like the last vid, I didn't watch it yet, but ik it's gonna be fire Just got through the first minute, Happy birthday Emily!
Just came across this guy for the first time, subscribed after 2 videos. Cutest gaming/YouTube couple, amazing editing that it's like being on the journey in person. Time to binge watch everything this guy has uploaded.
I just recently started watching you in 2024 watching you strive for the creative artistic way gaming can come in different shapes and sizes. I love that you're bringing the inner childhood of everyone around you out with the amazing designs in gaming rooms you create with you and your teams. I hope for you to never let that fire burn in your heart bro
I just got my first pc today and your the first person to pop up on my YouTube for a pc setup and your channel is awesome definitely going to be subscribing
Santa did a low key version of this for my kiddos this year. You had to be so excited when completed. So rewarding. Keep up the fun sir
New subscriber here from the Philippines! 🇵🇭 Rooting for both of your success. I've been watching your vids for two straight days—love it!
You make the coolest gaming setups, every setup looks amazing, cool video
Day 1 of asking Dantic to make me a gaming setup
Now this is some fire dedication to your girlfriend.... it's beautiful that you spent so much money just to make her happy..,And it's beautiful that she shows appreciates your by thanking you, it shows how much you both love each other.... Personally, this was a very good vid
You guys are so loving, happy birthday Emily.
Yes…we are really doing this 18:27
This is the definition of a proper YouTube video

Amazing video brother. You genuinely cooked with the setup
Crazy how in 4 months you’ve crushed your 500k sub goal?!
what an insane gaming setup / room bro!! 

Keep up the insane work!
Awmygod, that cable management is power! Let’s go overseas and see if omen will sponsor a road trip to do a amazing setup for a fan. Let’s try to get 3 likes to kickstart this crazy idea
Loved helping with this one. I think we did a pretty good job!
The thought that he would actually go through all this and put up all this money just for a hug from the bottom of his sister's heart, it really brings tears to my eyes, he's just fighting to have the best relationship with his siblings, God bless my friend
Hi Dantic! I was here wen you hit 100k and now i cant believe how fast your channel is growing! I wish you and you fiance the best of luck for the future!
How does this guy always find a way to give him self a way harder challenge in every video .It’s always like a super short deadline or something
i did watch the entire thing.. no lies.. i did watch it when it came out 50 mins ago but then DINNER TIME.. GREAT VIDEO!!!
your like the only youtuber i watch without clickbait thumbnails
MX$20.00 Te quedo super bro🫠
i love it! i recommend working on cable management on future setups as it improves the aesthetics so much!
0:10 ""Its not the best"" Yeah bro its an empty room ️
I wish I had someone like her, she's really my dream girl, but Emily seems nice too, congrats to you both
WHY NO CABLE MANAGEMENT????????????????????

I know in the future their will be a video on Dantic buying his dream car since if he continue with videos where he has to carry large furniture he will need a better car. Prove me wrong in the future
well done for 1 million
This setup is so insane, what a satisfying video

Hey Dantic,

I know this is a lot to ask, and I don’t even know if you’ll see this, but I just wanted to try... My Ps4 is really old, and I can barely run anything on it. I watch your videos every day, and they always make me smile, even when things are tough. I’ve always dreamed of having a setup like yours, but things at home have been rough, and I can’t afford a new one.

I don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful—I just admire you so much, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you’d see this and understand how much it would mean to me. Even if you can’t help, thank you for everything you do. Your videos make my days a little easier.
Another banger I love the videos
11:50 Why do you have in your phone a Monday??
Petition for Dantic to start a gaming channel.
bro the youtube ai says the topic is no cable management
2:42 Max lével complete! Now is time to build!
Hello from Denmark. Just wanted to drop by and say that me and my son are huge fans. We love your videos, and your gaming setups. Currently trying to make my sons gaming room Cool, but doesnt seem to live up to the ones you make keep up the good work. You inspire us

Emily and Adam's Turkish voice-over could have been better. Other than that, the video is great. Nice to meet you, my friend.

Welcome back to mychannel. And if you're new here, hey,I'm Patricia, a 20something year oldliving in Atlanta, Georgia. For today'svideo, I wanted to do like a desk setuptour. I feel like I've accumulated a lotof stuff while, you know, having asetup. I've had it for about like threethree-ish years. And if you watched mylast setup tour, then you kind ofalready get the gist. But I did removesome stuff, minimize it a little bitcompared to like how my setup was waybefore when I had like my LED lights,all that extra stuff. But enoughyapping. Let's get into it. Let's justjump in and start with the peripherals,the setup, you know, the main stuff thatmakes a setup what it is. By the way, Iwill be linking everything in my setup,majority of everything, as much as I canin the description below. So, pleasecheck that out. And if I did leaveanything out or if you had anyadditional questions, just drop it downbelow and I'll try to get to it. Let'sget into the PC. So, I got my PCpre-built and I got it from RGB CustomPC. I know there's like a lot ofcontroversy currently with them cuz Igot a comment recently and they waslike, ""Oh, have you heard what's beengoing on? I guess some people aren'tgetting their PCs after like a month. Idon't know what's going on over there.""So, you know, just do your research.Figure out which company you want to geta pre-built from if you want to go thepre-built route or you can get the partsindividually and build yourself. Butyeah, I got a pre-built just because Idon't know PC stuff. I don't know how tobuild anything and I didn't want tolearn just because I was lazy at thetime. So, I was like, ""Yeah, let's justgo the easier route."" This was also likekind of during co so I was like, ""Thiswas the cost effective route for me.""Originally, when I ordered from RGBCustom, I didn't have any issues.Honestly, I got my PC like a week and ahalf after and I got status updateswhenever they were building it, whatupdates they were making when they werein the checking stages. And that's theonly experience I have with buying froma pre-built company. That's why I'mtelling you all my experience. But justbe wary, you know, like do your ownresearch. Figure out where you want toget yours from. For my specs, I'll putthem on the screen and also in thedescription below. This is she. And thenI got this chromi cute Funko Pop justchilling in there. And then the interior[Music]This PC cost me like about like 2,000something only because I got another PCfrom them. Originally it was like a pinkcase and it wasn't a three tier likethis. It was like just two tier andsomething happened. It broke. I sent itback to them and then I was like since Isent it back to them let me like upgradeit which I did and that cost me just alittle bit more. So I changed the case.They added an extra fan and then theyfixed the piece that was originallywrong with this PC. I honestly do wantto upgrade her though because I don'tknow. My friend Nomi, shout out Nomi, umshe built her PC and it looksphenomenal. Who knows, maybe I'll askfor her help and see how I can upgradeit because like this is cute and I'mkind of liking how she did it. It waslike a glass case here as well as overhere and then you you can just see theinterior more, you know? But this is notbad. Like I still love my PC. It's myvery first PC. And then to decorate it,similar to have the chromy inside, Ihave this cute little sunny angel andthen a Kirby and then a Miffy light. Itactually turnson. Super cute. But that is my PC andshe gets the job done, y'all. Like Iedit all my YouTube videos on here. Igame, record YouTube videos on OBSperfectly fine. And then I also am goingto start streaming soon. So let's seehow she holds up. So far after like thatinitial problem that I had with myoriginal PC and sent it back and gother. Um I don't think I had any issuesafter that. I actually lied. I hadanother issue with my PC. Um now that Ithink about it, something died again,but this time I brought it to MicroCenter and then they were able to fixit, but they had to wipe my entire PCbecause something got lost in thememory. But besides those two times, thePC has held up. Yeah, technicaldifficulties, but you know, that's thatcomes with, you know, having a PC.Enough about the PC, y'all. I feel likeI just been yapping about it forever.Now, on to the peripherals. So, theseare some HP monitors that I have. And Igot these monitors like 3 years agobefore the boycotting. This is just thebrand that I got cuz I went toMicroEnter and they had a deal and Ididn't want to spend crazy money. Butthese monitors are the HP. It's like 27in something. And I think the hertz is165 if I remember correctly. She hasheld up perfectly fine. Haven't had anissue with the monitors at all. And thenI got this cute little background fromGoogle. But I would usually use like umwallpaper engine. But you know sometimeswhen I'm editing I don't want to likehave the wallpaper engine. It's like ananimated wallpaper. It just it gets verydistracting. So I turn that off wheneverI'm editing and then I kind of forgot toturn it back on. So we're just chillingwith Spirited Away wallpaper for today.Sunny Angels. Sunny Angels on themonitors is a must. Okay. And then I gotmy Elgato face cam. This is what I'vebeen like recording my gameplay with.Sooner or later, who knows? Maybe I'llconnect my camera to see if I can usethat as a camera on Twitch just so I getclearer quality. And sorry about mycable management, y'all. Oh my god,that's I can't. We We don't talk abouther. But I did try to make it look nice.Um, speaking of that, like, as you guyscan see, my dual monitor mounts. Okay,got these from Amazon. They have like alittle bit of cable management help aidright there, but it doesn't do that muchhelp, honestly. So, honestly, I'mprobably going to see if I can get adifferent monitor mount just becauselike I feel like it's it's protrudingout a lot. Like, originally, I thoughtthese monitor mounts was going to belike closer to the wall, but yeah. Whoknows? That's just me complaining. Butso far, the mounts are okay. I'mprobably going to change it, but that'swhat I'm using currently. I just likethat they're white and they kind ofblend in with the desk. And then for mykeyboard, I kind of forgot where I gotmy keyboard. Having a massive brain fartand I can't remember. I think it wassent to me from a company. The name onthe USB is Yaola. A U L A. But yes, Ilove her so much. Like it's very simple.It's not over the top. The colorways arevery like basic and simple and it goeswith my setup pretty well. And they havevarious different light patterns.[Applause][Music]Yes, love this keyboard so much. Andit's not super long, too. Like, it'sjust a very standard keyboard size. Andyou guys are probably wondering, okay,but what is that like light in the back?I got y'all. Don't talk about my cables.But yeah, this is like a goi light thatI have on both my monitors. You canchange the color, but right now I justhave it on the white colorway. And youcould see the other one right here. Itjust gives your monitor and your setuplike a nice ambient lighting and alsohelps with the eyes like at night. On tothe next item is this adorable speaker.This is the Doom Ditto. They come invarious different colors. There's a pinkone, there's a white one, a green one,and then that's all I know off the topof my head. It's so tiny and compact,but it's strong. Like, the sound isthere, y'all. I brought this to a picnicone time, and it worked perfectly. Thisis my go-to speaker that I use wheneverI'm not using headphones. And then ithas these like animations, graphics,whatever you want to call it. Like ithas this cute BTS one. And then you canput the volume up, you can put thevolume down. There's a clock, but theseare the ones that I didn't get. Theycome with the actual device. So then ifyou need to change it, you just go tothe D Voom app. And then it connects toBluetooth and that's how you use it as aspeaker. And then the next piece, Itotally forgot this y'all. So this islike a cord coil for your keyboard. It'sjust there purposely for aesthetics. Andyou know, I'm here for it. I got thisfrom Glorious. And they have variousdifferent colors, but I just went withthe white one because I was like, it'svery simple and it's going to go with mysetup. And yeah, you just connect it toyour keyboard. Just there foraesthetics, and I'm here for it. Andthen this mouse, this is not my mousethat I usually use. I'm letting myboyfriend use my glorious mouse, so Ijust grabbed it from him. Um, it is awireless mouse. I feel like it just fitsmy hand perfectly, you know? Like it'snot super big. Just look at the colors.It's just very simple white and then ithas like accent colors which is supercute and they're the basic like RGBombre which matches my PC. Y'all see thedifference? Like this is just a littlebit bigger. And I got this from Amazon.It was like my first mouse. And then Iwent to Microsenter. I was like, ""Oh,okay. Let's upgrade."" And I got this badboy. And I love it. Like everybody needsa wireless mouse. It just comes in handylike when you're when you're gaming. Youcould just do all this stuff. And yeah,I obviously don't know how to explaintech that well in tech terms, but Idefinitely know how to do it in girlypop terms. And it's very cute. Now, onto this lovely guy that I haven't evenset up that I had for a year. I am goingto set this up probably after thisvideo. It's a stream deck. I want to putlike some cool sounds, transitions, allthat stuff that can help with my stream.But yeah, don't even lowkey forgot howto like set this set it up. Honestly,don't have much to say because I haven'tused it, but I'm excited to use it. TheRazor desk mat, but I love her. Again,it's just very simple. Um, it's not toolarge. Like, you know, some desk matslike it reaches all the way up here.This is just very like in one area. It'slike half of a desk. And I love it. Ikind of prepared myself that I knew likethis desk mat would get dirty because itis gray. It's a light gray color. But,you know, I think a little washing willhelp. And also, cool fact, this rimaround the mat lights up. I justcurrently don't have it plugged in rightnow. But yeah, you can manage thatthrough the Razer app, I believe. Andlike you can pick and choose whichcolors you want. Or you can do like aombre, which is pretty neat, likeespecially when you're gaming late atnight or just on your PC watchingsomething. And then it's like a coollike, you know, cute ombre, a subtle asubtle ombre. And then another piece ofmy perfumes is my HyperX mic. I got theblack color way before they had thewhite colorway come out. So, I'm so mad,but who knows, maybe around my birthdayor Christmas, I will get the white colorway. But for now, she's doing what shehas to do. Um, gets the job done. Andthen the arm is just this super cheaparm that I got from Amazon like yearsago when I first started getting stufffor my setup. And then you can changethe base with this, I believe. And inthe back they have like a notch to likedetermine how do you want this mic topick up how you're talking. Like do youwant it to be all around? Do you want itto be on the side? Like are yourecording with multiple people and youwant them to catch them as well or not?So yeah, this mic is pretty cool. Butyeah, that is my peripherals y'all. MyPC, kind of some decor that I got on it.Desk mat, keyboard, not the mouse that Iusually use, but I'm using it currently.two monitors, mic arm for the mic,keyboard, speaker, stream deck, webcam,and then some decor. Very simple andstraight to the point for a feels. Ihave this white gaming chair. I used tohave the pink GRCing one and then I soldit. It was too bright, you know? I kindof grew out of having like a pink gamingchair. It was cute for the moment, but Ijust wasn't feeling it. So, I got thiswhite one and I love it. It's verycomfortable and like it has this likepattern on it. There's cushion on thereand then a cool feature and it's like afootrest or leg rest or whatever you maycall it. Yeah, I think this is like theeco something style kind of chair. It'slike good for your back or whatever. Andthen the desk. This desk is from IKEA,but it's just like your regular decularIKEA desk. Um I low key need to likeinstall a like a third leg in themiddle. I don't know if you guysnoticed, but like my desk is like it'sround in the middle. like it's dentingin the middle. You'll see that. So, Ithink I need to install a third leg forthat support. And I blame it on themonitors. Like, they're so heavy. Thisdesk is also from IKEA. It's just like asmaller version of this desk. But thisone has more wear and tear just becauseI had this mic arm right here. And Inoticed that I didn't have it all theway in. So, it was kind of like pullingat it whenever I was moving my mic. Butnow, I moved it backwards and I have itlike super good in there. But yeah, youcan see the damage. My god. But I've hadthis desk for like ever since thebeginning. So, 3 years. And that is myperipherals. And now, let's move on tothe cutesy stuff over here that makes mydesk setup like my desk setup. Like Isaid, these are two separate desks. So,like you're going to see this lineregardless. Oh, and then this is abetter view of my monitor mounts. Like,you see how far they come out? I don'tlike that. Like I feel like if I hadthem closer to the wall, I'll have morespace to like, you know, actually gameand just to do stuff, you know? It'staking up half of the desk basically. Sothis is my headset. This is the Razerheadset. Like it's not the wireless one.It has wires. They originally didn'tcome with these cat ears. I bought themseparately and just like attach them on.I know people say they're heavy and Ican see that. That's why I kind of likego in between them and also like myregular ear pods. Of course, I have alittle Kirby right here to accompany theheadphones. And then this little gadgetright here is like a label printer. Iuse this like whenever I go on trips andI need to label something real quick. Itcomes in handy. And you guys areprobably wondering like, okay, what isthis contraption? What is this? It'skind of like a desk bookshelf organizer.And my boyfriend's dad built this forme. I know I got a lot of questionsabout that. And she's stunning. Oh mygoodness. But yeah, we'll get into her.Don't mind this. This is just anotherlike dent in this desk. But yeah,underneath the bookshelf organizer, Ihave like these compartments of stuff.This is just remotes that I have tocontrol stuff. And then the second oneis like hand sanitizer, lippy stuff. Andthen the third one is just wires. Then Ihave some manga on display. We have thewhole series of What the Koi. So that's1 through six. And then we have In theClear Moonlight Dusk, 1 through 5. Andthat's not the whole series. I haven'tcollected manga in a minute, y'all. So Iknow I'm behind. But yes, as you guyscan tell from this, I'm a shojo girly. Ilove romance. Hopeless romantic. Okay.And I love reading about it. And nowabove it, I have just some cutetrinkets. This is another This is dead,by the way. I should have charged it.But it's similar to the Ditto overthere. Like you see how it has that cutescreen on there? This does the samething. And it's also a speaker. Supertiny. And you can put like animatedartwork on there to have on display.I'll charge this actually. And then Ihave some trinkets, blind boxes on here.This is from PopMart. It's the Herono. Iforgot which series, but this one'ssuper cute. This is also from PopMart.This is the Peach Riot version. And thenthis is a mythy blind box that I gotfrom Kinounia. And it comes with alittle Miffy. And then I have thiscapital pin um that I like keep rightthere. This is how it looks. It looksbare right now because I took thespeaker and I'm charging it right now.Now, right here, there's a middlecompartment in between like the twomanga areas, which I use for like, youknow, random stuff. So, I have thisHello Kitty notepad that fits perfectlyin there for whenever I need to quicklyjot something down. And if you guyscouldn't tell, I'm a BTS army, okay? So,I had the Butter album just chilling inthere. And y'all look how perfect itfits. Oh, it was like it was made forthat. And then this fits in pretty well,too. And since I'm an army, if you'renew here, I kind of want to see like,can you guess who my bias is? Now, on tomore manga. I have six volumes of Signof Affection. And in the back overthere, I have a Japanese version of Signof Affection. And then I have volumes 1through six of Blue Spring Ride. Andagain, these are all Showjo. No shame inthat. Okay. And then I have a lovelySmitzky right there protecting themanga. And now above all that manga, wehave more trinkets. So, we have thiscute Kirby. It's like a mochi Kirby. Igot this at Mini. So, the next figure isa Hatsune Miku one. This is the Sherryversion. I got this at an animeconvention. And then this little likecup. It's like a Spirited Away teacupthat I got from Barnes & Nobles. I thinkI just put some of my cute pens that Ihave. Like this is a BTS pen. This is acute pen. Um yeah, just all these cutepens. Look at that. Oh, and then Iforgot this guy. And then this isanother version of Kirby. And I justkeep that like right there. And nowbehind Hatune Miku, I have this anotherlike gadget. This is again from Doom.This isn't a speaker though. It's justlike it just adds some cool ambiancelighting. Let's see if it'sdead. It's dead. I'm going to chargethis so I can show youall what it lookslike. But it's very cool. Like you canchange the lighting with this. And theyhave various different options. And thenthis photo card in the back. Minyongifrom DTS. This is my bias if y'allwasn't able to guess it in time. I havethese cute little prints that I got fromShutterfly and I think they were free. Ijust had to pay for shipping at the timecuz they were doing a deal. They justlike spice up the wall a little bit. Nowon to my pegboard that I got from IKEA.This is like the standard size pegboard.It's not the large one. It's just theregular one. And then to decorate it, Igot these like little pieces that theyalso had. So these are just some keysthat I have for keyboards. And I thoughtit was cute to put them on display. Andthen I have this Herono figure. I forgotwhich series, but y'all, he fitsperfectly right there. Oh my goodness.And then next to it, I have thisportable CD player that I got fromAmazon. And then of course, a new jeansCD album. And this is the remote thatgoes with it. I don't even know if it'splugged in though. Pretty well. Like thesound isn't too bad, but you know, it'snot like um a surround sound type ofanything. But for like 20 or $25, it'spretty good. Nostalgic. And then we moveup a little bit and we have my Apple AirMaxes. And then over here, this is JunkCoup. He's my bias recorder or honestlyhe may be like handinhand but with Yi.And then I have myAirPods. I forgot what this thing iscalled. Is it Pochica? Um but it's fromChainsaw Man. Andoh, and I got that from an animeconvention. It's just so cute. And atthe very top of the pegboard, I havemore blind box figures. They're eitherthe Herono series or the Peach Riotseries. And aren't they just so cute?Like these girls right here, they are socool. And Heronos are just like oddlyweird, but I love it. And then chill inthe corner is of course a Sunny. Itotally forgot to show y'all this blindbox figure. But this is another PeachRiot. This is Frankie. And she'sprobably my favorite out of the three.Like look at that. She looks so cool. Somy favorite would probably be Frankie,Poppy, and then I don't even know this.Is it Gigi? Is that her name? This iswhere I keep all my like markers,highlighters, pens, rulers, erasers, allthat stuff. And then, of course, a Kirbyjust chilling. But yeah, that iseverything on this side table that Ihave. And it's a lot, but I feel likeit's it's not over the top, you know,like it's very tasteful and simple, butkind of like maximist in a way, but verycutesy and trinkety. And y'all get it,right? And I love how everything justblends together so seamlessly and likeit doesn't look too much but it's justenough, you know, very girly, mangarelated, K-pop related. And yeah,underneath my desk setup, I have thisMiffy rug that me and my boyfriend made.We went to like a tufting class for ouranniversary. And this is the contraptionthat I created. It doesn't even looklike Miffy. It looks like Miffy oncrack, but you know, um, memories. So Iwas like, this is very cute. Then I havea trash can. And then I have some cablemanagement right here underneath, whichdoesn't even look all that good, y'all.Like cable management and me do not gohand in hand. So you see thisloveliness. And you go underhere. What is that? Jump scare. Jumpscare. Okay, this is the cablemanagement that I tried to make work,but I kind of got lazy in the midst ofit. And then it's just like a bundle abundle of wires. It's just a bundle ofwires. But next to it, I have like somemore stuff, you know, miscellaneousstuff. This is a controller that I usesometimes. This is like the handle forthat mic right there. So, if I wanted toput it on the table, I could. And thenright here, this is like for mystationary giries. Washitape. Okay. I just have a bunch of washitape. A cute littlestapler. More washi tape. A littlenotepad. Stickers. So, like whenever Ido giveaways or whatever, I like to givethe winners like these stuff. Just somerandom stuff. Write them a note. And Igot this Miffy sticker thingy. And thenthese are more Myiffy stickers. This iscinnamon rollstickers. My melody stickers. Literally,y'all, I have somuch. And then on the third row, it'sjust like a lot of like sticky notes.And then I got this eraser from MountFuji. And then when you erase it, it'slike it's shaped like Mount Fuji. Moresticky notes and stuff, tabs, likey'all, just stationary heaven, if I mustsay. Underneath all that, I have like mybig K-pop photos that does not fit in myphoto album book that I have cuz I havelike a main one that like suits all thesmall ones, the small photos, but theseare like super big. We have junk cook.More junk cookook.Yi tay. And then this whole compartmentorganizer thing. I got this from IKEA.And it's just like so much stuff, y'all.Like I am probably not going to gothrough it one because it's notorganized and it's a lot. I have likeNintendo cases. This is my K-pop albumbook that I was going to show y'all.Okay. And this is my K-pop album book.It's nothing crazy. I know people havelike so much, but I just have like, youknow, I just have New Jeans and BTSbecause those are the two albums that Ipurchased before. I don't purchase K-popalbums crazy though. And like I said, Iwas going to show y'all how this Voomthing works. I think it's the DoomPlanet 9 or something. But yeah, if youjust twist this knob at the top, it haslike all these color options. It justkind of just adds some fun color to yoursetup. I'll probably leave it on thatone. That one's cute, right? And thenthis one, this is how it looks. I haveto like connect it with the D Voom app,but you guys get the point. We have likea cute animation on here. But yeah, thatis my setup, y'all, in a nutshell.Overall, a lot of the stuff in my setupI purchased myself. Uh there is stuffhere and there that was gifted to me. Alot of it came out of pocket, but worthit though because I absolutely love howmy setup turned out. But I'm glad I wasable to share my setup with you guysbecause I know some of y'all who are newhere had some questions and wonderingwhere I got stuff. If you made it thisfar into the video, I just want to thankyou so so much for watching. I hope youenjoyed. And if you did, please makesure to like, comment, and subscribe.That was actually so much fun justyapping about my setup. So, I reallyhope you all enjoyed. Bye guys. See youin the next video.[Music]Heat. Heat.","back from a little hiatus, i missed y'all! <3
seeing your serup over the years is craazy cause it's stayed relativley the same but it's still always shocks me?! it's so beautiful.
your desk setup looks very comfortable to work and lounge in, love it
I also have the Aula keyboard! I love it so much, but I changed the keycaps to the Osume Dalgona keys. So it's a pretty, cozy brown color. Like coffee!
Hello Queen! Amazingly cute setup! Sorry to provide unsolicited advice, but I always recommend for gaming and work desk setups to get custom cut plexiglass for tabletops. Just take the tabletop measurements down to Lowe's Depot and they cut it to fit and it's cheap. Protects your desktop, easy to clean, and you can decorate under the plexi with photos and such. Love it for my WFH + gaming setup. 
What games are you playing?
I've been addicted to ESO since 2015 and now Diablo 4. Still dabble in FN, but I'm horrible.
Litterly soo stinking cuteee and ilysmm
Love your desk set and I love spirit away
Whoa! This setup is amazing
for the monitor mount use a piece of 1in wood on top the mount and under neath the mount to take the sag out it helped me cause i use 3 monitors
So cute!
I got a prebuilt from RGBcustoms too back in Dec 2023 and I was lucky to get it before stuff went down. I got a free livestream to watch too because I was already hanging out in streams for about a year before I bought. But about a few months after getting my pc apparently they filed for bankruptcy, shut down their store and sites and didn't send some ppl's pcs out so that was a shock. A shame cause I really liked them and would've bought from them again in the future. 

Anyways your setup is really cute~
I love to hear patricia yap
heyyyyy YouTube fam
Hey Army! Definitely Suga Bias!

So, here are three things Iadded that helped me turn this intothis. In part one, we added a rug, hungup some shelves, and now I'm reallyexcited to start decorating more. I wasfeeling really indecisive about what Iwanted to do under this window. Butyesterday, we were at a thrift storedropping off some donations, and ofcourse, I ended up spending money. Foundthis pastel purple bench, and I justknew that it would be perfect. I getreally in my head when I'm decoratingcuz I start thinking about whether otherpeople are going to like what I've doneor not. I'm really just trying to findstuff that feels authentic to me.Nothing says authentic like this weirdlamp that I got when I was like 13 yearsold. The third thing I added was thiscat window hammock, which is really morefor me than them because they won't stopstepping on me when I'm working.Collected my first victim, and ofcourse, she hates it. She literallycannot believe I would have the audacityto think she would want to enjoy a plushseat at a window looking at a tree.Everyone keeps telling me I need art andtrinkets. And don't worry, that's whatwe're going to do in part three. I'mgoing to be hanging up some of myfavorite art, which looks just like mycats. And I want to figure out a goodway to display my Tamagotchi collectionand some of my other little figures.","Looking great so far!
It looks super cute and very cool :)
A warning to putting stuff near your window is that some items may fade overtime due to over exposure to the sun

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gfAx1MLpqo,shorts,@Fluxphy,Xbox Series X vs PS5 Pro in game… #setups #xboxseriesx #ps5 #gamingpc #shorts,42315,2025/1/6 0:00,0,106,,#setups #xboxseriesx #ps5 #gamingpc #shorts,0,,UCMzr9YZgGmv7Lht-t367PcQ,@Fluxphy,,30900,5405364,298,2014/2/1 0:00,📩 fluxphybusiness@gmail.com\n\n,PS5 Pro versus the Xbox series X it'stime to see which one performs betterboth were actually able to hit 1440p and120 FPS in fortnite and in war zone Iwill say that the PS5 Pro had noticeablya lot less input delay like it literallyfelt like I was on PC with like 50 pingit also had slightly more FPS and italso supports 8K resolution but thenagain what 8K games are there on Consoleso at $200 less the Xbox series X isdefinitely a great option but the PS5Pro gives you that extra step and extraperformance for those more competitiveand hardcore gamers,"hey just a fun fact, it’s not actually 1440p. it’s 1080p upscaled
Sony made 8k games on the ps5 pro but I think the we should be asking is who has a 8k monitor
I like the xbox controller more tho
If someones really a ""hardcore competitive gamer"" whos trying to min max performance, they wouldnt be looking at consoles anyway
Xbox series x already had the features PS5 pro has. Plus two simple options regarding performance or quality with upscaling. Not to mention backwards compatibility…
I would say buy a PS5, PS5 slim, or a Series X instead of the PS5 Pro because that's a $300 dollar increase from the PS5 and you can build or buy a better PC with $700
Ps5 pro:2024 console / Xbox series x:2020 console
In raw power the xbox is mote powerful than the normal ps5, the only reason that won is because its newer and is upscaleing a lower resolution.
I love ur content man
You might as well build a budget pc for that $700 price tag
For me I feel like the xbox has less delay but me there both mid compared to my pc
Just plug in the controller and save 200 dollars its not worth slightly more fps
“Extra performance” yeah bro like an extra 3 fps, we’ve all seen them comparación videos of the regular ps5 & pro
Im sorry but no one should buy that 700 dollar rip off
@Fluxphy input delay is based on the polling rate of the controller not the console, Xbox Controller Polling Rate 125hz, PlayStation Dualsense Polling Rate - 250hz, If you get a Third party wired controller for Xbox you would not be able to tell the difference.
Also, if you're not gaming with a wired controller then you're not playing competitive.
50 ping is good? I guess my 14 ping is god tier.
If someone is a hardcore gamer they have to use a pc
Xbox series x also supports 8K WITHOUT UPSCALING
The real question is are you gonna to buy an 8k tv or monitor
Just get PC you. An 3050 and r5 5600 700 or better if you build it yourself
now its 100 dollars less
Just get a pc
Just get a $600 pc
I have xbox game pass on 2 devices and controllers so im looking for a console and its a no brainer

I have ps5 pro and the problem is the comfort of controller so if that isn’t good I will always go back to xbox controller comfort is very important
How about Xbox series s on warzone is it solid in the future
What’s interesting to note is that the Series X runs a handful of games slightly better than the PS5 Pro, like Alan Wake 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Space Marine 2. In most other situations, they’re extremely close to one another, with just certain titles pulling ahead on the Pro. 

Even after 5 years, the Series X is still a very potent machine, being able to run an open world UE5 title like Stalker 2, which utilizes both lumen and nanite, at 1440p upscaled to 4K, and Indiana Jones at 1800p, 60 fps, with RTGI enabled.
At $700 the PS5 Pro is not doing enough for that kind of money. If it was an open platform like PC then maybe I can see a good value proposition. But it lacks important features like the disc drive, native keyboard and mouse support, a vertical stand. You gotta have these things included with your premium product.
The pro ugly is crap. Ps5 is the ugliest. I hope they get rid of that glossy crap on the ps6. I prefer Xbox hardware.
They had to come out with a pro to barely beat Xbox
The XSX have more teraflops which means it CANNOT have lower fps. Plus on a test the ps5 get 120-100 fps while the XSX has 120-115. Pick PS5 for
Exclusives.
Best Controller Features.
Cheaper Subscription.
And Better Coonectivity.
Pick XSX if:
You want better fps and graphics
You want exclusives like fh5,starfield,and halo. (Fh5 is on ps5 now).
And if you need browsing, streaming and all those features.
As well as if you want the gamepass which is better you get access to 100AAA games for more money.
But if you're willing to play fortnite more. Go for the XSX.
What camera you got?
If the new Pro doesn't out due a 5 year old series X ye ponies truly would of been shafted.....
Bro PS5 PRO OFC IS BETTER CAUSE IS NEWER FASTER XBOX SERIES X CAME OUT 5 YEARS AGO OFC PS5 “PRO” WINS IF YOU HAD XBOX SERIES X GALAXY OFC THEY ARE THE SAME CAUSE IS NEWER
PlayStation
If your just going to get a ps5 just get the normal one it's less expensive and but if you have a xbox one you might need an upgrade tell me if am wrong
Xbox 2020 ps 2024 u cant compare
Can they run Crisis
PlayStation fanboy prolly never actually played Xbox, only probably got it to hate it
PS5 pro. It's gonna be better it's the pro
XBOX BULT DIF
I just belive xbox is better then ps5 even tho i play on xbox series x and pc
Xbox series x beter
Just get a pc dawg

PS 5 is always the best

I'm Jourdan, a silly goose who loves playing video games, exploring fantasy worlds, and hanging out with my cat, Riku. \n\nI also like mean blondes🌻","[Music]Hello and welcome to my gaming roomtour. My name is Jordan. If we haven'tmet before, hi. Hello. Nice to meet you.And if you do know who I am, you likelyrecognize the shelves behind me as Ifeature them in like all my content.I'll get questions about my gaming roomsetup, about my PC specs, and so Ithought it would just be fun to give youa full tour of my gaming setup. I willshow you how I maximize my space in hereand all the fun little trinkets that Ihave gathered over the years. I am quitethe maximalist if you can't tell. Allright, without further ado, let's get onwith the tour. Come along. Come along.Let's do this.Let's start our tour at the mostimportant part of any gaming room, thedesk. I use this Dell 34in widescreenmonitor that wasn't really meant forgaming, but I got it at a great price.I'm kind of a Logitech girl. I've gotthe MXM 3 mouse. I've got this lovelycreamy keyboard and the G735 headset.I've also been using this Logitech Bluemic for the past couple of years, and Ilove it. I think it's amazing. And Irecently just got a mic stand for itthat has really upped my audio. I tendto use a controller for a lot of mygaming. And Trolley sent me this reallyfunny controller stand that I've beenusing recently. I've got my KingdomHearts coaster and a bunch of littletrinkets that I keep on my desk likepens and hair clips by Mommy Dy. I lovethese. So, on to my PC build. I have anNZXT case. I needed it in white becausethat's my aesthetic. And I put all thesegoofy stickers on it from cons anddifferent things. I just love my littlestickers. This bad boy runs on an NvidiaRTX 4070 12 GB GPU and AMD Ryzen 7 5800CPU. We got the Corsair Liquid coolerand fans and the Corsair Vengeance Pro32 GB for memory. And it has a MSI B550Tomahawk motherboard. I also have awonderful Herman Miller Aaron chair thatmy dad stole from his office for me. Itliterally saves my back posture whileI'm gaming. Speaking of gaming, there isone game that I've been playing non-stoplately that I need to talk about. Ifinally started playing DisneyDreamlight Valley, and I've alreadyspent so many hours decorating myperfect little valley. There's trulynothing more nostalgic than building adream village alongside the Disney andPixar characters that I grew up with.You can farm, fish, decorate, go onquests for your favorite characters, andthere's even online multiplayer so youcan show off your valley to yourfriends. I love dressing up my littlecharacter. Look how dang cute he is. anddecorating my home and tending to mylittle garden. This is literally theepitome of cozy. This also felt like theperfect time to start playing sinceDisney Dream My Valley just released anew update with a new character andquests and they're dropping more contentevery few months. It's really theperfect game to jump in for a quick cozyreset or spend an entire afternoon within the most magical way. Thank you toDisney Dreamlight Valley for sponsoringthis video. I love your game. You canplay Disney Dreamlight Valley yourselfon PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and NintendoSwitch and get started on your valleytoday.Let me take you on a tour of my iconicshelves. They're my pride and joy, andI've just loved all the little thingsthat I've filled them with over the past2 years.The star of the show is my beautifulplant.Her name is Bulma. I think she'sbeautiful. I got her at a local plantstore here. And I don't know how I'vekept her alive all this time. I don'tknow. This is just kind of the the Lordof the Rings shelf. We have my beautifulpopcorn bucket. We also have KingTheodin's sword. I'm obsessed with thisthing, but I need to get a displayholder for the wall so I can like put upthere. How do you guys think that wouldbe nice? And then I'm sure all of youhave noticed this amazing Lego set. It'sthe Lord of the Rings ribbon bell that Ithink is just the most beautiful part ofthis entire room. This is a SailorMoonlight that I got on Amazon like twoand a half years ago. So hopefully thelisting is still up if you like it.These are Stein from Germany. Actuallyfrom Germany. And because this is abookshelf, I we I did put books on it.Um, so here are just some fun picturebooks and adventure books, differentlittle things I've either thrifted orbought over the years. And this is mydedicated Stardew Valley corner. I get alot of Stardew Valley things fromfriends as gifts and brands. So, we'vegot our little petty candle. And thisthis is a diarama made for me by GamerNostalgia. That's literally my characterthere. I love it so much.Got the cookbook, the guide book. I havea Stardew uh controller as well. Just mylittle my little shrine to one of myfave games. We've got a little trinketcorner under here with my prizedautograph from Deborah Wild from BaldersDay 3. So cute. And a picture of ShadowHeart um behind it that I need to getframed or put on a wall somewhere. Herewe have a speaker that I don't useenough and probably should, but it islike 10 or 15 years old, so you know,it's probably not as good as it could beanymore. And we got the Junimos from FanGamer. And then two absolute baddy iconsfrom animes. We've got Trunks and Toga.They're the baddies.Another book for the bookshelf. Somemore trinkets and books and things fromtravels and adventures. Then we haveeven more Legos. Legos are the best.More plushies, some of my faves, morebooks, and then a few more books just toround it all out. He's beautiful. Trulya masterpiece that I am so proud of. Ilove this bookshelf. It's so maximalist,but I that is my vibe for sure. And thenwe have the mini bookshelf that matchesthe big bookshelf um with just some morehellowith some more of the books I've beenreading recently and some vinyls. Andthen these are some cubbies that are somonstrously packed with all of mycosplay and sewing stuff. It is it's Iwill not be looking inside there. And wehave Riku.If you've seen my short form videos,you'll know that I I do this view a lotfor my filming. I'll set up my phonelike here and I'll do my acting.It's cuz it's straight onto the windows,so I get the best lighting, the naturallighting. You also get a lot of shotsfrom this angle, too, for the samereason. We'd love some good lighting andthe beautiful shelves in the background.Oh, and I can't forget to show thesecond full desk setup that I have inhere. This one's got a fun dark theme tocontrast the light of my setup. And it'salso rocking a Logitech mouse andkeyboard, plus an ROG monitor, and itdoes not have its own PC yet, but thatis on the wish list. Some final littledetails of the room. There are a bunchof swords everywhere. Um, a lot of mytrinkets kind of lying around. We've gotRiku's little bed, and probably some ofthe worst cable management you've everseen. Here's also a peek at what thesetups look like at night. I love theglow. I've been adding a lot of the RGBlighting in here recently and I justfeel like a real gamer when I'm in here.Plus, there's no overhead light, so Ikind of need these to see anything inthe dark. So, put all of that togetherand this is what you get. It is not thebiggest room, but it is what you do withthe space you have that counts. Andhonestly, this is like the coziest spacein the whole apartment, which isn't thatmuch bigger. And that is the end of ourtour. I hope you enjoyed this because Ireally did. Let me know what kind ofcontent you want to see from me next. Iappreciate you guys so much and hope tosee you in the next one. Subscribe ifyou want to. I love you. Goodbye.[Music]","You can join me in Disney Dreamlight Valley here: https://gmlft.co/DDV_JourdanGames_YouTube
Wow love all the Lego cars!! and Rivendell! ️
A game room is goals and this one is done well. Love the neon signs.
5:32 my dad actually has that exact same giant speaker, neither of us care that it isnt the highest quality audio, because he got it second hand, but it just looks so cool and that was enough of a reason for him to get it
dripped out white pc gang! love the setup dude
Well this was super fun! This channel is such great vibes.
Your smile is amazing, always makes me feel better
Oh I love this! 🩷🩷🩷 Nerd Room Tours are the best, just a collection of all that person’s most loved stories. That Devora Wilde autograph is awesome!
7:58 I want this neon lights
Love the cable management lol. Also the Gaymer sticker! Cute room :)
Finally got Stardew Valley (love it!)... I was super surprised to find I already played a game just like it last year called Palia. It's basically the same premise except abit more expanded on and all 3D and modern glow up graphics.. It doesn't quite hit the charm of old school sprites, but it is an MMO so that's cool. You should check it out!
This room gives off Xerneas .
Bless sweet fluffy Riku!
That sit up is so clean! Thank you for sharing, you have an amazing space that experiences yourself! Cozy space for sure!
Nice Kame island wallpaper on the monitor.
Legos truly are the best. You need more on display
Side lighting is the best.. overhead lighting is pure anxiety imo lol. Also those shelves are nice!
Happy Thursday Jourdan, I always enjoy your Stardew videos!!! Disney Dreamlight is one of my favorite games currently. I have 300 hours in the game, and my favorite charecters are Wall-E, Anna, Elsa, Remy and Mickey!!!
Sims, Stardew, Dreamlight and Fields of Mistria are the cozy games I enjoy! Great setup!!
I love your gaming room
El gato es lo mejor
looks cool
This is a dream room
Thats such a clean setup! Love the lego cars especially the little porsche 911 at the bottom
Thats a pretty cool mouse, I have a bunch of stickers on my pc too lmao
Ahhh I loved seeing everything in the room! Love your setup so much
You should play this game called vintage story it’s really good it’s like Minecraft but you can put a lot of more details and more realistic
I...I don't know how I got here, but I don't think I want to leave. I am just very confused?
Okay Jourdan
I've always loved your set up and style! So cute!
Loving the setup. Gonna have to take some inspiration from it for revamping mine.
Such a beautiful and fun set up ! I love how you arranged your bookcase (Hello Trunk from the future ! One of my childhood's crushes ) It's so cute how Riku (please correct my spelling if it's wrong) was staying in your arms, with his little paws on your arm, being rocked around. And congrats for the sponsorship !
Hello Riku!!
Nice room! Do you have a link to the display at 6:29?
Do you happen to know where you got your desk desk? I am using two tables put together, and it's miserable, lol. Your desk looks super spacious and nice! Also adorable kitty bed. I'm trying to find one for my cat Jester, and I might need to look into that one, haha. 

Cute video!
I'm lit sitting in that same chair in the smoke shack...
happy pride month ms jourdan!! love the setup :))
I like a nice and clean setup! I guess it's also your workspace, but man!... where do you keep all your mail and papers and stuff? XD That's what clutters my space.
W MAIN VIDEO JOURDAN
Hay Day the best Farm #HayDay
6:48 So you have chosen death.
Noice!!!!
I've got a desk, a computer... Yep that's about it :P

For real though that looks sick! :)
That must be an expensive apartment
cute
Everyone I know get their Herman Miller chairs by unconventional means
Nice! A little bit too bright for my taste, but as a streamer, you need the ""gud lite""!
What mic stand is this? I have the same and can't get the one I have to keep it in place. And if you like to get a similar plant, there is the Blue-star Fern (Phlebodium aureum), but I personally prefer the Kangaroo Paw Fern (zealandia pustulata).

For anyone interested, I have a chair from the same brand. Wait for a sale or get them refurbished. Better for your back then any gaming chair. Don't forget to move at least 30min a day and do basic back training. No back bain.
There must be technical issue here, I cannot find the OF link. Pls help !
You must be rich
I shudder to think what that apartment must cost.
What city is that?
It is really my dreaming corner! By the way, we have a game collaboration opportunity and sent email to you~
The Lego set is almost $700...
this comment refers to 1:37 in video. you must be very bussy person because of your nails ^^ Very nice setup :)
BBNO$ !??!
Yo like how gorgeous are you

It's your boi, curlypop

Thepoint of a gaming setup is to playgames, and I would take an extra 10 FPSover a Nano Leaf any day. But Carter, itneeds personality. It's too boring. Whatdo you mean by personality? The FunkoPop and the IKEA plant. Like, I'm sorry.This doesn't have any personalityeither. Everyone's setup look like thisin 2021. So, not only did they put allthis money into making their setup lookunoriginal, they spent more money ontheir nano leaves than they did oneither of their peripherals combined.But with this, yeah, you might not begetting any personality, but at leastyou're getting the best performancepossible. And what do you meanpersonality? Like the person at thesetup brings the personality.","I will never understand someone who copies a setup
Hot take, buy what you like and makes you most comfortable sitting at your desk
I think the real setups with personality are the ones without the nano leaves, but instead stuff from your hobbies, like I have a litophane of TPAB by Kendrick, a car, spongebob, a old look globe sharpner, an airsoft gun, sunglasses (i collect them), etc. Nano leaves add nothing, its the stuff from your hobbies that adds personality
The outro is your personality carter ️
I need an outro at the bottom so I can focus carter ️
tbh, i would never personally want the first setup just due to the fact that i like my setup to not just function really good, but also look nice. I completely understand people who just want a setup which just works really well without all the bells and whistles, but I like me some bells and whistles
I care mostly for performance first, I don’t care too much about aesthetics as long as it doesn’t look like crap.
If you want personality just put personal stuff at the desk. Things you like, things you collect. honestly the Funko pops would work
make your setups actually personal. Don’t use rgb that everyone else uses, build a custom keyboard, make your build more fitting to you as a person. Keep things minimalistic if your a perfectionist, or have ocd, and if your more worried about aesthetics and filling your desk space up optimize your setup for that. Try to use natural light and certain types of wood you like to make things more comfortable. Add warm light for nighttime environments and add small trinkets and things that you can actually use and don’t take up too much space. Let’s say you like watching DVDs, do you really need a DVD player on your desk or could you just put it on a TV stand. If you really need it in your setup try to keep it hidden in some way whether that be by going to a furniture store and replacing your table legs with cabinets so you can put the player in the cabinet, or just putting it on your floor. Make sure to pick a color palette beforehand, for example right now I like beige, brown, black. Also customizing your OS can be a huge part of it. If you don’t want to go through the hassle of installing linux and ricing it, there are ways you can make your windows experience 100x better and more personalized. Make your own wallpapers. For my most recent setup I found a photo of an F-105 and I color graded it, added some effects, and a clock, and it feels super original, not just the same wallpaper everyone uses. I actually like fighter jets so that adds a touch of personalization and goes so far. Hope this helps, have fun!
Performance and comfort should take priority over EVERYTHING! By ""comfort"" I mean I personally like playing my pc games on a tv on the couch like most people would play a console just instead of a controller i have a keyboard on my lap and a mousepad on the couch next to me. Before spending a SINGLE DOLLAR on aesthetics, I would shoot for the 65""+ 120hz (thats as high as they make them, I checked) oled, or if your style is more leaning in, crow-necked 2 inches away from the screen on a desk to get that 360° no scope headshot, then you should be shooting for the 600hz monitor. Either way, if you can't afford the top tier of your display style of choice hooked up to a 9800x3d and a 5090, then you SHOULD NOT be spending a SINGLE DOLLAR on aesthetics. Who cares what the hardware/setup itself looks like? The ONLY thing tha should matter is the quality of the screen, the quality of the render to that screen, and the COMFORT of the setup based on your personal preferences. Once those 3 things are as maxed out as possible, THEN you can worry about aesthetics/""personality"". Im relatively poor so I can only afford my rx5700xt which I recently bought used, and my ryzen 3700x so I rarely surpass 120fps, and again I like playing on a tv on a couch so I recently got a 55"" 120hz mini-qled that was a display model at best buy so it was discounted to $300. My pc case, however, is super busted up to where ino longer has the hinged front panel to access the disc drive, and power/reset button, OR the side panel anymore. I got it for my first build roughly 18 years ago with one of the very first quad core cpus ever made (intel q series) making it so old it has bays for optical disc drives, and hdd's AND the power supply goes on the TOP rather than having an enclosed chamber on the bottom like you see today. Its stained all to hell, It looks like nasty crap, but guess what? I could not care less because it still holds every component i could ever need just fine WITHOUT being a fire hazard, which is the ONLY reason I wouldn't simply use a cardboard box....
A setup like the first one will develop personality as you collect knick knacks over time
Fax
Cool lighting and decorations make it feel more homely. It’s not just about functionality (but mostly it is)
My gaming setup is covered in dust and cables, that's personality
I'd take extra cooling over being able to see the pc
You can add some stuff you like if you want with and empty desk.
How does he know about the IKEA plants
Nah i feel like dont copy setups but dont also keep it plain
my whole setup just black and white




Keyboard mouse wallpaper mouse.
Not original but good and simple it's the only the it has lol and random 16gb ram sticks on the desk
I think the best way to make a setup is to spend money on performance and decorate it with things you just get naturally. I know I was gifted some star wars posters which I use to decorate my walls along with other personal stuff. Using things like my graduation tassels and other things just to add some personality works too. No need to spend money on so much decoration, stuff you get throughout your life is so much more personal and unique than anything you can buy on the internet.
If I shell out 3 salaries on a mid range build, I'd want it to be the most eye catching thing in my room as it's the most expensive thing in my room.
Looks super clean ngl
as a child working in Chinese sweatshops I don't give a shi about what customers want, I work everyday no matter what
Ok, I don't understand the generic ""gamer setup"" but having your own personal style as your setup feels genuinely awesome and super cozy, no matter what game you play
I've got a pretty neat setup, my PC is in a cabinet inside the wall, with all the ports and the power button routed to a wall plate by the desk. Keeps everything neat!
Exactly.
I would still like a second monitor tho, just comes in handy and I don't care about having like 10k FPS on some random ass game lol
Vibes are so important
@Shleerp, tremble, for your days of digital reign are naught but fleeting whispers! My kingdom shall rise like a glorious sunrise, bringing your flimsy domain to the very ground! My loyal soldiers, my unit of unwavering fans! We go to war!
Nano leaves in the big 25 is sild
i used to use a hard back book as a mouse pad.
HP 14"" Chromebook Laptop N100 4/64GB can you review this laptop for me please? since I'm about to be in high school, I need a laptop
I totally agree with carter
I sometimes hate entitled people who trash other people’s set ups saying we need flashy stuff like it not a fashion show for desk it just something to do
Personally the best gaming setup is whatever you have that makes you happy
""It needs personality "" so do them
That's my setup, A laptop and mouse without a mousepad.
cheers mate
Hi Carter 
I’m Jebar, 23, from Ethiopia. I lost my two sisters this year and became the only support for my family. I had to drop out of college because of financial problems, but I never lost my passion for tech, video editing, and content creation.

I’m not here to beg, but to ask with honesty — if you have any phone or device you no longer use, even if it’s old, it could change my life. I want to start creating videos, editing content, and one day inspire others like you do.

Just one tool can change everything. Thank you for being a light for people like me.
They did indeed back then
I love playing games Carter, yessiree
Dothethugshake
Me who made arch logo with nano leaves:

(I use arch btw)
I really want a completely new setup, something akin to a cockpit more than a desk. Also, “what do you mean with personality” goes for EV haters as well sometimes
I have one laptop and one mouse, I think that's a good setup.
I decorate my desk with occasional kinder egg toys that i sometimes buy at my grocery store
Personality here I think is more about weather you feel like it is special to you, not necessarily if it is original. I for one like it if I made the majority of the stuff on my setup
Nothing ahows more personality than a trashed cables everywhere setup with half a case with high end hardware...

Im kind of projecting here.. i have a broken side panel and had to remove the front panel to fit a radiator.. 10 dollar desk 5 dollar plastic chair WITH A 3080 PC on a shit tn panel 1080p 165hz display.. a half destroyed model o wireless mouse and a g pro x keyboard scammed from logitech support after i bought a used one and the rgb started dying randomly
Carter.. You wouldnt understand
Potentially hot take: the “nano-leaf no personality setups” that’s what those of us who can’t afford those setups dream of… my setup has a lot of expensive shit, but it’s all performance no looks… I got hella into audio stuff, went through 4 different kinds of speaker setups, to settle with studio monitors and a sub, plus a goxlr and at2020, most of that was purchased in college when I had no bills and a work study that paid me jack squat 800$ a month, but I spent like 80% of that on setup upgrades… anyway, TLDR, we dream of setups like that but tbh, in my case, I have way too many fucking cables to ever even get cable management successfully, and having a shitty ikea desk with no metal or anything to magnetize cables to, well… a nice fancy setup is next to impossible, I’d rather be confident in my performance and experience gaming…
Guys remember if you paid for it you can make i however the hell you want. Even if its ""unoriginal"" or has some plants, its still your setup and you can do whatever you want with it.
Clean and slick desk set up over any jumbled up neon lights any day bro
I have $1200 ABS AMD Cyclone, $30 mouse (on sale to $13 on new egg when purchased), $13 keyboard off Amazon (I mainly use controller and play vr so I don't care to much), and a roku TV the size of my desk. I absolutely love it because I get to play the games I love. It doesn't have to have RGB and nano leaves to play Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, VR, and every fromsoft game.
The personality comes if you use it long enough
The only reason I have nano leaf lights is because I won them in a giveaway
Jokes on him. I've been running this for years (cuz broke)
personally i'd make a portal 2 themed setup if i had the money
My setup is weird but it's my PC connected to my TV I sit on my bed and use my chair as a desk since the actual desk is to close
10k likes on this comment and he build me a PC and I listen to thick of it 30 times in a row

Long overdue. We'refinally building this gaming setup at astudio. And we're at where any goodgaming setup begins. Orange County,California. Let's go. I don't know whatI'm getting. How much you think I'mgoing to spend?[Music]I have a checklist of things that weneed for this setup. Starting with thePC. I already have one, but we'll seewhat they have because maybe I'llupgrade my PC. Hey, of course we come onthe most busy day. 5080s. 5080s. I wasreally hoping for a 5090. Maybe we won'tupgrade the PC today. I really want onethough. Low key. Should I just get itanyways even though it's not a 5090? No.How long you think I need? Long enough.Six. [ __ ] one of these. Oh, they gotcable management stuff. Oh, I need that[ __ ] bro. Yeah, you do. My [ __ ] Weshould make a video fixing Josh's setupone day. We should show him my PC withthe leg stand. That [ __ ] tilt, dude.There's a lot of zip ties here, but tobe honest, zip ties are overrated andit's a lot of work if you want to takeit down. Something like this is a littlebetter because it's velcro, like velcroties, and it's easier to take off. Youdon't have to cut them. Something likethis as well, just to like tidy up thecables together. I know I'm going toforget something. That's That's theproblem. You have the Ethernet cablealready, right? Yeah, we need that. Ishould have had a plan. I never have aplan. It's like the most boring microcenter haul ever. We'll get some morecool stuff. What the What is that? Yougot to buy a new camera. No, that'sscared me. I'm broke. Hey Josh, you needa new blow dryer. Tell me why I walkedin his room once. He's using anelectronic air duster to dry his hair.I'm like, ""Bro, I got one. I should usemine."" It wasn't even blowing air, but Iwas blowing dust exposing me. You don'tneed no RGB. Oh, check. That boy tall.You might need Sony monitors. Sonymonitors. I think we have one. Probablynot the same one cuz this new ever. Oh,that's a new new one. Yeah, this onejust came out probably have this oneright here. It looks like has like thesame stand. So, this one's 480 Hz. Wait,they're both 480 Hz. Wait a minute.Similar specs. It's 2K 480. This is 2K480. Is that same size? 27 in. I'll beright back, man. We're in the monitorsection. It was looking grim. Normally,I'd also need to pick up a monitor, butI already have one at home uh thanks toSony. They have one in stock and I'm washoping to have a dual monitor setup, sothey're going and they're grabbing itfor me right now. Oh, you got it for meright there. Here you go. All right,guys. Oh, it is the same monitor. Is itthe same monitor? Bang. Yeah. Yeah, thesame name. Sort of the same box. Is thisthe last one? It's the only one. Thankyou, guys. Have a good one. Let's go.With this monitor, it's the first timeI'm not buying monitor mounts because ofthe design of the monitor mount. It'sactually pretty sick. And I'll show youguys more later. I think we're good.That's a wrap for Micro Center. UnlessJosh, you want some? Yeah. $10,000. Buyas much as you want. $50 for a cable? Idon't know if I want it that bad. $50?Oh, it's the goat. The goat. This islike the LeBron of esports, bro. It'scrying out.Actually, is the goboy. What you know about this? Come on,bro. Stop playing. What you know aboutthis?Only one they had.Is that crazy?[Music]Help me out.[Music]Black and white. One, two. Car has aura.You already know what where you at.Somehow we always end up here in everyvideo, right Josh? Like I swear I don'tcome here all the time. Yeah, we're justgetting like a bunch of desk accessoriesand a countertop for the table. [ __ ] inthe car, bro. What? Don't say that.[Music][Music]It's been a while since you guys haveseen the studio. This area is a totalmess, but we're working on it. We gotsome small progress here. The KiloEscape has made a return. We got somerandom jumbosized Pokémon cards. Shoutout to Cracks Toys, my boy Matt. SomePro Grails. This little area is kind ofcool. We got Josh eating this littleshell. I love this area. This plant ishuge now. I got this plant a year ago.Look how much it's grown. It's all theway over here now. You guys rememberthis living room. We turn around. We gota live streaming setup. By the way, letme turn this light on. Much better. Thishas been a lot of fun. Bubble M is thegreatest Pokémon card ever made. Car'shere.But yeah, this is like the last part ofthe studio. I really need some seriouswork. There's this big wall over here.I'm going to clear all of this out andthen build my new gaming setup.It's been a while since I actually hadWell, okay. I have a gaming setup athome, but it's kind of like a makeshiftsetup. Plan to have this place for along time. So, this setup is very, verypermanent. But also, we're taking a verydifferent approach than his setups inthe past. I still stream, not as much.So, the main focus here is it lookinggood, not the functionality. Although,I'm not going to build a setup that'simpractical to use.[Music]One problem. So, tabletop thing that webought, it's too small cuz like thispiece is supposed to connect the twolegs, but um as you can tell, it'staller than the desk. And then this thisis the top. The depth of the desk isalso smaller. I realized what I didwrong cuz when I bought this frame, itwas supposed to originally be for abigger tabletop. I get what you mean.So, it's going to be like hanging likeYeah. Yeah. So, we got a new one. Oh mygoodness. Things always go wrong.Finally, since the last clip that youguys saw, it's been about 3 or 4 days. Iwent to the bay, visited family, andalso went to a Warriors game. We went ona whole mission today just to get thistable top. I know it doesn't look likeanything special, and trust me, itisn't, but it's exactly what I waslooking for.So, this is birch plywood. I got it fromHome Depot. It's finished already. Um, Imight have to stand up and fix up acouple random things, but it's wood.It's never going to be perfect, and I'mperfectly fine with it being unfinishedor like not perfect. Long story short,we went to a Home Depot. They had thewood that we wanted. Pause. But themachine to cut the wood didn't work. Andoriginally this was 4 ft deep, which istoo long for a desk, but I feel likethis is basically perfect. Now, themoment of truth is making sure that thisthing fits on this thing. 1,000% Ishould have measured it. Oh, barely.It's like an inch. So, I don't know ifyou can see,but yeah, we're good. It clears. This isgoing to be a sick desk. By far the mostunique desk I've ever built. And it'ssuper simple. So, perfect. Step numberone, we got to build this frame. Then,I'm debating whether or not I actuallywant to put or drill or glue thecountertop to the frame itself or justput it on top and then put like rubberor something so it doesn't, you know,scrape or scratch. We'll cross thatbridge when we get there.[Music]What is in here?Sounds like screws.Voila.Tons of them.These are like the little feet thing.And then there's a little beam in themiddle to make sure everything's stable.Hey,perfect. No, this is exactly how I wantit. This desk is huge. This desk ishuge. The way we rock. Scary. Live lifeon the edge. It's It's massive, bro.Hey, it looked better, huh? Big olddesk. Have you ever seen a gaming setupdesk this big? Yeah, it looks like adining table. Lookie. Nice. 3 2 1[Applause]Weno.[Music][Music]What do you think? Are youall the way? No.Nice.Cool. So, desk is mostly done. This isprobably the coolest desk I've everowned. Not the most unique desk, but Ithink it's pretty different for likegaming setups. What you think, Josh?Yeah. Jump on it.It finally break it out. Okay, so fromhere, I'd probably normally startbuilding the actual setup itself. What Iwant to do is start putting this stuffon the wall. Start with mounting thestuff. Have these pegboards. Probably goeven from the middle, left and right. Ialso have this shell, which I'llprobably go offset onto this sidebecause I already have a basketball loopright there.[Music]I want it to be like[Music][Music]Can't help myself. See what this feelslike with a real chair. I've alwayswanted a desk. It's huge. It's a new dayand I recruited alltime greats.He brought in the big guns. Oh yeah. Ialways had this dream to get thismassive desk, but also I didn't realizethat it would like bend this much. So Itook a quick trip to IKEA and yeah,let's do this earn stuff. Well, time toget to work. Since this desk is so thin,I have to use like the thinnest screwsever. Like, they're so tiny. What? It'llbe fine, right? Yeah.They're um half an inch because the deskthickness is 38 of an inch. Y'all shouldsee my POV right now.Big ass eyes. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. So,y'all see I think you guys can see howmuch it's bending just by that thatspot.Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have muchfaith in these little screws, butOh, if you're wondering why I have twowhite dogs, one is our friend. Yeah.Looks good. No more bend. Missionaccomplished. So, with the desk done, wecan now get to building the actual setupitself. Monitor stand is so cool. Theyprobably get mad at me for doing this,too, huh? And any good setup starts withthe monitor. Thankfully, while Sony sentme that one, I bought this one. Andalso, this video is sponsored by Sony.Micro Center had one last one of theSony M10S monitor. For any setup ofmine, at least especially gaming setups,you need to have at least two monitors.The Sony M10S is a monster performerdisguised as a minimalistic productivitymonitor. The chassis and design languagescream simple, but the specs scream topof the line. 480 Hz, 27 in OLED, QHD1440p, small bezels, easy setup,lightweight, minimalistic stand, and athin display with a innovative coolingsystem. I genuinely can't name anythingwrong with the M10s. Oh yeah, and as Imentioned earlier, this is the firsttime I'm completely ditching a deskmount. I still have nightmares trying tomount 30 lb monitors. Not fun at all.But with this, I feel like I'm notsacrificing anything at all. All whilehaving no compromise on performance, I'mall in. I've been able to use my otherSony M10S for about a month already.Loved it so much I went out of my way tobuy another and Sony doesn't even knowthat. While they are the sponsor oftoday's video, I will say if thismonitor has taught me anything, it'sthat the days of going for the highestrefresh rate monitor and ignoringeverything else are over for me. I stillremember when 240 Hz was all the craze.Now double that and add every premiumquality of life feature into awell-designed chassis and you'll findthis monitor, the Sony M10S. You cancheck it out with the link in my bio.Sony, thank you again for sponsoringthis video and helping me build my dreamgaming setup for like the 75th time.Okay, so this is going to go up. So thenthis is going to go like this. And thenthey like[Music]Hey, hey, hey.[Music]$50.[Music]It was orange. So I had to[Music]like this thing's a smiley face.real ones from like my community and thestreams know the importance of thesmiley face. So, if you know, you know,we also had to cut it. Shout out toErnstell for the idea. I would havenever never thought of that. Hey,hey,it should be in the middle of this andthis way. No, I don't really know wherethe[Laughter]Give me that.A little cricket. Like just shimmy me itthis way. Just Oh,yeah. That's good. Perfect. Thisactually does look cool.All right. Taking this off.All right. So, this is a magazine I gotplaying basketball, but it's signed byKD. Oh, wait. I should move this.Thought this would be a good place forit, too. And it's orange with thepegboard. I didn't know what to put onit, but I think it looks okay for now. Idon't need to overdo it. Yeah.[Music]I always wanted this mic cuz it's white.Oh my god. Are you okay?Is it okay? We're good. Is it recording?Yeah. Oh my god. Chat broke his lens.How much is the lens? Two racks. Betterget a million views. I don't even wantto record anymore. Where should I putthis? Well,thank God. Hey, Sony, how about wesponsor a lens video?[Music][Music]It's day three building in the setup andtoday we're going to finish it. Right,Josh? Mhm. I'm about to I'm about totell himwhat theall my hard work. Here's a littleprogress report of where we're at.Thanks to Ernstell for helping meyesterday. Put it on the desk. Hey Har,what you think? No. No. Come back. Har,say cheese. The crazy part is that shegoes on the table at home. Um, afterWhat happened? Huh? Still my toe. No.What happened to my tripod?We got this picture up yesterday.Decorated a little bit, of course. Gotthe monitor set up. I put the 151Charizard right here. I think I want toput the full evolution. I feel like thatwould be sick. That sucks. What? Youdon't got it.You did it again.That's you, bro. It's tough. Remember myold sub um sub emotes? S smiley faces.Josh, if I put you in charge of cablemanagement, you think you can do it?Do you mind? It's everywhere. Today,we're starting with cable management cuzclearly uh well, I don't have that manycables plugged in yet, but it's the mostimportant part of any any setup, period.I got this big old desk. So, that's mymission. This shouldn't be that hard.I'm going to start with this powerstrip. We got to get it mounted righthere. Um, I don't really have an exactidea of where I'm going to put it. Ijust kind of put it somewhere and thencall it a day. This a good spot, right?All right. Can you hold that side up?This is so weird. Hurry up, bro. No, I'mlowkey enjoying my time down here. [ __ ]Hurry up.All right. I should do the other side,huh? Yeah.Oh my dog.Why are you still here?I kind of want to move the uh cablemanagement thing to the left, too.This is going to be pretty boring, butumlots of cables. I'll update you when Ihave something else.maybe some advice or insight for peopletrying to manage their cables. A problemmost people run into when building agaming setup is that their cables aretoo short and that's why they can'tcable manage it. Definitely invest insome longer cables. I usually if it's ashort distance, I do at least 6 ft. Thisone's 6 ft. This one's 10 ft.And I even got an extension for like apower extension just in case I neededit. Things like this always make adifference. In the past, I would gosuper crazy with the cable management,but in all honesty, like I'm lazy,especially now. So, I just bought thislittle like rack thing. I'm just goingto put all the cables on there. It's notthat big of a deal to me. As long as thecables aren't touching the floor orhanging, um, then I did my job. Andespecially cuz I know I'm the type ofperson that likes tochange gear. And see, like, look howshort this cable is. But I'm the type ofperson person that likes to change gearand nicely cable managing everything isnot the move when that's the type ofperson I am. Also, I know I used tonever use these things, but somemonitors have like a little cablemanagement thing right here. Definitelyuse them because they're there for areason. Also, when you have a really bigdesk, um cables are going to be likethis. And the only way to really make itlook nice are cable sleeves.So, you know, the cables won't be gone.You can't magically just make themdisappear,but at least you can make it look neat,and that's that's the whole goal here.I'm going to cut this, but I'll show youguys what it looks like after.Would you look at that?Careful. All right. So, I'm in a littlebit of a predicament. I want to put thePC like tucked off in the corner foronce because I always put it on theright side of the desk, but I didn'tthink about how the cables would just besticking out over here and that kind ofit don't make me feel good. So Josh saidI should put a plant here. I was like,""Well, Josh, you actually had a goodidea for once."" This is what I decidedon. I just moved that plant to theground and pushed the um side tableback. But we'll plug everything in andthen I'll try my best to use the cablesleeves to make it look kind of tidy.Obviously cables are cables and they'regoing to be there, but hopefully itlooks okay.One thing about me, it's about thedetails. Got an orange XLR cablefor absolutely no reason. I don't knowif you can tell, but I've been likingorange recently.[Music]Make sure to keep your XLR cablesseparated from the rest of your cables,or else you'll get static in your mic.And another thing, these Velcro ties areway better than zip ties, no matter whatanyone says. Not my best work, but umgood enough for me. You got nuts in hisback. Yeah.What the Why are you not petting me? Hedon't want you to do that no more. Whyyou still crouch like that?Yeah,yeah,yeah. Look, look. It's like I'm racingon father time. Hard to see the visionwhen you only see dollar signs. Stick toplan A cuz the B feel like compromise.Thinking [ __ ] sweet. This the like theydon't advertise. Supposed to use yourvoice, but when you do, you getostracized. Overall, I'm really happywith how it turned out. Feel like theblue here contrasts really well with allthe orange. I added some little detailsbecause well, I love this bag and it'sone of the coolest collabs in gaminghistory up there. Of course, I had toput the Dreamcast. Something about theart on these boxes just looks so cool.And it's nice to have this much space onthe right side of my desk cuz usually myPC is there. And as much as I love myPC, which is still my old PC, the onethat I had at at the house in my setupthere, I just moved it. I like howsimple it looks while still being verycolorful, lots of contrast, and at theend of the day, still me. That chairisn't permanent. I have another chairover there, but um yeah, it's just kindof here for now. Every time I've donelike an all-white setup or a mostlyblacked out setup, it didn't well, itlooked cool, but it didn't really feellike me. This This feels like me. If youremember my original setups, there was alot of black and white contrast. I thinka lot of people try to go for one or theother. The white and the black justcontrast so well. More minimalistic yetstill unique and interesting. Let meknow you think and appreciate you guysfor watching. I'll work on a studio tour","i think the desk legs are upside down, that metal bar going across the floor is supposed to lay under the top part of the desk so it wont sag
all of lough’s eras are combining into one!

isthe world's largest gaming monitor as Itry to build the largest gaming setupyou have ever seen some of these itemsyou won't find in any other setup like a98 in TV or maybe a PC so heavy it takestwo of us to carry and so much more butif I really want to build somethingmassive I have six items I need to orderstarting with the keyboard world'slargest gaming keyboard wow I'mabsolutely butchered that one red dragonk605 this thing is absolutely massive itis 200% the size of regular keyboards atthe cart so next we gothuge huge gaming desk okay hear me outhow big are the Ikea butcher blocksfirst time ever spelling somethingapparently okay hear me out Quin whathappens if we build one on the front oneon the left one on the right to make aU-shaped desk going to put togetherthree desks to make one Mega desk addthecart right huge mouse wow pretty bigmice well then this this might be itthis might be it I mean at least we gotan ergonomic design but bro look how bigthis is on her hand add the cart allright but for our main monitor I know wealready have the TV downstairs it ispart of theirxl90 line any true gaming setup doesn'tonly have one monitor it has a secondarymonitor so that's where we're going togo you got a bunch of 49 in oleds onthere Odyssey Neo but we want somethingbigger what about the Odyssey art sothis thing is coming in at 55 in 4k 165HZ I mean at this point you might aswell just classify that as a TV add tocard we got a lot of power in thisgameing sets the most important we gotto find a massive PC let me see here 10biggest cases in 2025 so I have beenreading a lot about this one so it's theCorsair9000d so as you can see it can fit up to18 fans accommodates six ssds five hddsthis thing actually before you build itit weighs in at 65 lb and they have anestimate once you get this fully loadedit's over 100 lb just for the PC casedud look at that look how much roomwe're going to have in that okay epicart 500 bucks for just a PCcase this is great how much have youspent so far well you were supposed tohave the money tracker above us oh sorryyeah put that up thank you now that wehave the PC case we just need to finishbuilding out the PC and since we'realready on corsair's website I'm goingto go ahead and grab a power supply anaiio some RAM and all 18 fans for thiscase but don't worry we still have thetwo most important pieces being an theI9 14900 k and a 4090 graphics card Idon't think I've ever seen moneydisappear from my wallet as fast as itdid right there but thankfully all weneed to wait for is for all this to shipout now I think this setup is going tobe a tad bigger than what we'reexpecting I mean we did get our 18 fansin here you got the 55in Odyssey Arc butthere's one thing that I have to mentionis whenever your PC case says carefulit's heavy and on the side it says itrequires a team lift you know things aregoing to get a little crazyoh wow what a PC case this PC buildscares me though because between a 98 in4K TV as our main monitor to oursecondary monitor being a 55 in 4kdisplay I don't know how this PC isgoing to hold up but before we get tothe build I have to give a huge shoutout to Corsair for partnering with us onthis video because they ended up sendingus a piece C case a power supply Ram AIOand don't worry we didn't forget aboutthefans oh crap and just in case youwondering 10 12 14 16 18 plus yourradiator plus three fans on the GPUthat's you're going to have like 25 fansin this thing but the final spec listboast that this is one of the fastestPCS that you can build right now I meanbetween a 14900 K processor to 4090 GPUand clocking in with 64 GB of ddr5 RAM Idon't think this puppy will have anyissues handling multiple 4K displays nowthat we tested the PC and we got it onon the very first try you're going tohave to trust me on that one we're goingto take it back down build the rest ofthe setup now you may be wondering toyourself man it looks a little bitdarker like the sun kind of went downand wow they installed the secret gamingroom entrance doors no we weren't uphere that long we literally justfinished clearing out the entire livingroom here in the gaming house so youguys better like this video Andsubscribe but now we got to add in thebase of it the gaming desk now to standout from your overused typical Ikeagaming desk we put three of these badboys together to make sure we had enoughspace for this massive setup well nowthat we got the desks all set up thatonly means one thing it's time to getthis party started and get our gamingsetup on it first up is our Shack sizedkeyboard and like I mentioned earlierthis keyboard is 200% larger than yournormal keyboards how am I supposed touse like w ASD to move and jump but nextup we got the massive scroll wheel ofdeath now I would be lying to you if Ididn't say this piece of the setupscares me the most because it doesn'tmove like an ordinary Mouse but ratheryou use this big red ball right here tomove your cursor around which is goingto make my life miserable trying toscroll across two massive displays thatwe just installed combining for153 in of displays just because I don'tthink you guys realize how big thiskeyboard is this is you this is the guyshe tells you not I mean I'm so sorrynow that we got our peripherals andmonitors installed it's time for themain event the PC but let me remind younow that we have the PC fully built outit is weighing over 100 lb I mean it'sso large you can fit a whole other PCinside of it and not to mention it makesall the components inside lookabsolutely tiny and I would like toremind you guys this is a 4090 in thisbuild it doesn't get any bigger thanthat but this is where we ran into ahuge issue as we were getting everythingconnected I realized that both the TVand the Odyssey Arc monitor were HDMIports and the graphics card that'scurrently in my PC only has one HDMIplugin so after hours of trying tofigure out a solution we ended upconnecting everything through theSamsung hub which I know sounds like asimple solution but as we were trying toget this connected the Samsung hub didnot want to display both monitors to myPC but let me tell you guys wherethere's a will there's a way so we wereable to figure it all out and still ableto use the main TV for our game and ofcourse have that ultimate brain rot ofSubway Surfers on the secondary monitorall right it's the moment we've all beenwaiting for it has been hours the sunhas set it is literally dark outside butwe have the entire setup ready to go sothe last thing we got to do is puteverything to the test and see if we canactually just get one kill I know mostof the challenges are like hey can youwin a game of fortnite no if you don'tsee that Mouse over there and thatkeyboard we're going for one kill to seeif anything in this setup is actuallypractical now we have been talkingNon-Stop about how big this setup wasbut I didn't realize how difficult thiswas going to be a game on it until I satdown I mean the keyboard itself was sobig I could barely press two keys at thesame time and don't you dare even get mestarted on this mouse pray for me Joelgreater or lesser than 3% that I get akill on the first drop in probablylesser but I'm glad you have so muchconfidence in me oh my gosh dude are wedropping boys I'm not even worried I'mnot even worried we're getting a solid30 frames up there so do you feel likeyou're at the advantage absolutely not DI can hardly press e to pick up a weaponon this thing oh mygosh this is so bad I think this is abottoo 3% my rear end did I go against abot just maybe but now that I haveconquered our first obstacle of seeingif I can actually get a kill on thisthing let's see how the rest of thematch goes my hands are cramping up Idon't know if I can finish the wholegame I can't even go and press m for themap look I can't run and press M Iliterally my pinkies cramping pressingshift oh they don't even know you knowwhat I think we're just going to go forthe win that's it this setup isUN that really went differently in myhead all right if we were to categorizethis entire setup to least the best I'mgoing to go the worst thing in the setupit's the mouse that thing is unusablebut then that keyboard I mean the factthat I was like literally trying get mypinky to hit shift to run not usable PCTV monitor I mean all these things arestuff that people normally use overallthe setup I probably won't be playing onit again just because of how impracticalthe screen size is also but if you guysare looking for a screen size that isplayable make sure to check out mymonitor video here but we'll see you onthe next one,"0:37 dilido toys is crazy
RIP electricity bill
For a house that size, you definitely need a setup like this.
This setup remembers me off when I was a child and how I saw the world
I'm just glad there's someone on YouTube to test the set ups that us people say what if
We see that search history
5:53 Bro forgot about the chair
I am a first time viewer but i actually love this, i loved the vid and everything but i would recommend if you could use it as a racing simulator with the huge screen it would be amazing. That’s all best of wishes!
No big chair :(
that PC is actually insane - amazing video brother
i would be sleeping on the couch if i purchased these lol
You know when small kids use adult size stuff and you're all like ""aww how cute!"" 
Ridiculously fun to watch you pain through it haha
Also the gaming house looks beautiful bro!
3:38 just in CASE (pun?)
W chair
2:42 bro a 4090 from ebay
0:37 human [______] is crazy
-Wants to build a ""massive"" pc

*doesn't buys a threadripper

Nah man, that's not going to be massive at all
Wow this was MASSIVE! it really got my LOW expectations high, and made my views on a normal PC TAPER and FADE
Tiny Chair ?
7:26 You had your fps locked
What about the 50 series?
+99 missed calls from shaq
Why 30fps with 4090?
6:25 The largest chair?!
Underrated channel, you definitely deserve more subs
trackballs, for those not used to them, do take a bit of time to get adjusted to. And like gaming mice, they also have adjustable DPS settings which would make it easier to use.. i hope you didnt give up on it.. Personally, I want someone.. ANYONE.. to make a gaming capable clone of the old $20 Logitech Trackman Marble (the slightly larger than a normal mouse with the trackball in the center front, and buttons on either side of the ball.) I get Gameball makes one, but $200 for one isn't in my price range

i get the theme of the video was biggest everything. but I have to guess you did swap back to a standard sized KB and mouse afterwards
The min Fan Speed was never more important
This reminds me of MrWho’sTheBoss really cool! Little expensive though lol
Just my thoughts. 

Not the largest gaming PC setup and less enjoyable than other options. Start with modular displays that have high pixel density. Expensive yes, but when there is a problem you replace a part instead of replacing everything. Also can always add/remove panels or create a non standard display shape (can be useful).

As for the PC setup itself. Start with motherboard stands and mount to the frame of modular screen setup, creating custom mounts for pc parts (video cards, HDs, extension cards, etc.) with standoffs and aluminum extrusions. Hide HID pref cabling in the display frame to the desktop and a single cable to a dock or USB extensions for dongles.
the tower 900 here! maxed out. my pc weighs 100 pounds. my monitor is the acer predator 43 inch and I'm running klipsch 12 inch 600 watts subwoofer with monitors at 200 watts. Welcome aboard to the massive pc users.
0:17 did you say Massive
wOw!!! that's a dream set-up for me. Thanks for sharing...
Put a Mini ITX parts into this case.
Should ran dual 5090s that woulda been INSANE
Aside for the cool setup you've got an amazing physique man congrats !
why no Ryzen i9 processor????
this video deserves way more views and likes
this setup is very MASSIVE. just like my LOWWWWW TAPERRRRR FADEEEEEEE
@5:35 this is just embarrassing as a pc builder
Why not amd? r9 9900x?
surprised you didn't go with threadripper. 64 core 7980X is the obvious choice
Calling a trackball a mouse 

But in all reality, switching from mouse to trackball comes with a decent learning curve, especially to an office/productivity one like the Ellecom Huge. Ellecom's Deft Pro has much better ergonomics for gaming!
I'm gonna lie bro, this is sick
You could make a beast pc with this massive case
8:30 Normalyyyyyyy!!!! Huhhhhh Bro i have a 2060
We got shaq's gaming setup revealed 
Btw love the vids
That PC ain't having heat problems for a entirety
Ngl this deserves more views
I just saw this same big monitor at Best Buy and would definitely buy this if I could
Bigger does not equal better. I find it much harder to take everything in on a monitor that's too big for my field of vision.
holy crap how is this video and channel so underrated
This guy deserves more views this was a very expensive build
Nah the electricity bills abt to be wildin
BRO YOU’RE MISSING THE WORLDS BIGGEST CHAIR ??..?
I’m tryna get that desk!! Where is that from!?
I have the odyssey ark too , I need to hit the gym cause u lifted it up on the desk like it was nothing
It looks like you made a mini itx build in an atx case
why no one on youtube has made a comparison video of odyssey ark with other odyssey models... its so confusing at this point. the only plus point for me in odyssey g9 is that it has oled , other than that everything is better in odyssey ark... can you pleaseeeee make a comparison video of comparing other monitors with odyssey ark? pls pls pls there is no one else on yt who can afford it ig
Where’s the chair!
am i tripping or did you pair a 750w psu with an i9 and 4090?! the 14900k alone pulls like 500w.
Lol that massive setup with a little stool
Damn bro 
Its worth the watch but damn
Prices be much
Imagine donating 1/10 of all expenses to one minor YouTuber
why not a 9800 x3d
How could the largest gaming setup not have a projector to project an IMAX-size screen?
3:34 One man, a lot of fans challenge
This is the kind of setup that Shaquille O'Neal would have
you should put a smart bulb so you can change the colour of the room and then it will look like a gaming room
BRO IS GONE MAD
Insanely Outstanding....
New fan here..
Your videos are so amazing sir. Keep it up for making new contents ..
My pc case is about half size and it takes at least two people to lift it. Imagine how many people it takes to move this
Whynnot get a display port to HDMI adapter/cable? It took me 2 mins to figure that out when i first started with my rx 580
Bro that setup was Massive
Bro forgot about the 5090
Video Is Good obv
But His Arms got me inspiration !
Give this gaming set up to Shaquille
You forgot the hugest gaming chair buddy.
great video !!!
why not a threadripper?
next time use a cable with HDMI on one end and Display on the other.
0:16 u know what else is massive
5:12 is sooooo funny
Now THIS is gaming content
The shaq gaming setup fr
Yo your videos are so good why don’t they have more views and likes????
Gaming monitor is basically a tv
0:29 massive
Broo next time make the worlds most expensive pc
shaq's gaming setup:
you cold have got a roku or smart tv that connect wirelessly and you could've clicked windows and k you can connected the wireless display
Bros tv capped at 3” hz and had vsync on 2 and was like “I’m running 30 frames”
will a HDIM splitter work for the moniter and TV
low taper fade
Max it out with 9800x3d and 5090
Thank you for keeping the meme Massive
These brainiacs didn't wire up all the fans. $80 worth of exhaust fans doing nothing.
Mans just built shaq a whole gaming setup
What about the 5090
This is you.... And this is the guy she tells you not.... I'm sorry.....
I think you forgot when TimtheTatMan streamed some games from the Dallas Cowboys stadium (using their Jumbotron as well)

I was still a kid andfast forward 4 years ago it's my firsttime building my very own self-built PCand today I finally built my gaming desksetup that I thought I would never buildthis minimalistic setup shows thebalance between Simplicity andAesthetics without breaking the bank sowithout further Ado let me show you mygaming desk setup for 2025the center of this gaming desk setup ismy ASUS T F15 the specs of this gaminglaptop is not only decent for gaming butalso for my studies video editingworkflow and multitasking the Intel i51400h and RTX 3050 is still powerful formodern gaming especially if we going toadd the 24 gigs of RAM that it has italso has 1.5 tab of storage which makesit an amazing package and in terms ofperformance on valerant it candefinitely hit the 144 FPS cap of thebuilt-in monitor that has 1920x 1080presolution with 144 Herz of refresh rateand in terms of maxing things out I'vedone it as well on Elden ring with RTXon set to high and all settings set toMax it averages around 47 FPS and thetotal amount I spent on this gaminglaptop is$1,100 including the RAM and storageupgrades so now that we talk about themain character of this desk setup let'sintroduce what One By One The Ts thatrevolves around it for the externalmonitor what we have here is an LG 22inmonitor with 75 HZ refresh rate it'sflicker safe but unfortunately we can'tget advantage of its AMD free syn yeahit's not a gaming monitor becausepersonally I think it would be anoverheal if I would settle for somethinglike that the built-in screen of mygaming laptop is already 144 Herz andthis exact LG 22in monitor as well iswhat I'm using for my Apple ecosystemsetup or maybe let's call it a staticproductivity desk setup for 2025 which Iwill release soon as well by the time Iuploaded this video for sure it willcome out shortly few days after this I'mjust going to put the links to mysubchannel where I will post it or exactlink of that video on the description orjust spin it on the comments once itcomes out but back to this gaming deskset up both of my gaming laptop andexternal monitor are being held by thistwoin one laptop and monitor mount whichI can confidently say that it's durableand it can definitely hold the weight ofboth of them but it can also carry moreweight if we're going to add my V12turbo laptop cooler this kind of setupis optional but what I like to do hereis remove the mount and directly placethe cooler this is all worth it becauseof how insane this V12 is it's a closetype lower style laptop cooler thatsupports 15 up to 22 in laptops whichmakes it a good accessory for hugelaptops even bigger than mine like Tooff17 this is also the same cooler that Ireviewed before that straight down drops33° C of your thermals in just a shortamount of time even your on Max settingslike having RTX on it also has RGBlighting which fits the theme of thisgaming desk setup and you can furthercustomize the Colors by its fourdifferent changing modes and even thebase colors as well has four changeablecolors you have the controls for thatjust located in the center part of thecooler that also has the digitalinformation of your current operatingfan speed this turbo cooler can operatefrom 300 to 2,800 RPM and it's poweredby a 14 cm fan trust me even the 300 RPMcan simply drop your thermals for like 1to three in difference and again it caneasily drop your thermals just like minefrom 96 down to 75° cus in just under 90seconds that stays in there because ofthe memory foam that seals the airintake to just directly go inside yourlaptop and if we're going to talk aboutthe elevation this V12 also has that itsupports twole height stand that makesyour laptop cooler offer more cold windintake to your system the only con forsome people here is it needs to beplugged on an outlet as it's a differenttype of a laptop cooler this has a poweradapter that needs to be plugged in it'sdifferent from what you may know likeUSB powered laptop coolers but again interms of performance it's definitelyneeded as the performance and thermos ofyour gaming laptop when using this V2turbo cooler are going to be amazing ifyou're interested on this product I'lljust put the links in the descriptionagain shout out to Lano thank you forsponsoring this video that's pretty muchit for the left side of this gaming desksetup we can now go on the middle partwhich is somewhat the control center forthis setup for the mouse we got aLogitech lights speeded g304 it's awireless mouse that has two modifiablebuttons it's also powered by a double Abattery and it lasts 250 hours it weighs99 G which makes it lightweight but thebest part here is it supports up to12,000 DPI I think it's a decentflexible Mouse for this gaming setupconsidering I have different dpis fordifferent games or just for normal tasknext to that we have the Royal cludgercade g68 mechanical keyboard it uses ared switch and has three different modeswhich are wireless Bluetooth and wirconnection it's also an RGB backlitkeyboard which fits the main theme ofthis setup it has a total of 13 lightingmodes colors are changeable as well andwhat I really like here is the shortcutsfunctionalities compatibility are bothsupported on Mac and windows to wrapthings up on the middle part of thissetup we have a black desk matat which Idon't remember how much is it but it'sprobably cheap we also have a Maplewooddesk compartment which matches theMaplewood desk table as well both ofthis definitely made the setup cleanerand brings out the nature Vibe of thissetup we also have some notebooks justin case I have to write somethingbecause although this is a gaming setupthere are times that I'm using this aswell as my primary workstation foreveryday stuff moving to the right sideof this gaming desk setup we have someaudio related stuff here first is theMarshall Amberton which is a portableBluetooth speaker it's a quality speakerthat excels so much on base sound andhas a good amount of battery life thatlasts for more than 10 hours on maxvolume we also have a wirelessheadphones which is the Sony wh CH 520it's an entry-level headphones but thequality of the sound output is goodenough especially if I want to hear theaccuracy of my tone for my voice oversit really decent the only problem couldbe its comfortability issues which I'mnot a fan of I use this always for longhours and it does hurt my ears a lot dueto its pressure but everything else likeits battery life that lasts for 2 daysor probably more than 50 hours it's agood addition to this gaming desk setupfor some design related or just feelerson this setup we have a warm light desklamp which has few levels of light thatcan be controlled by this knob but Idon't like the fact that it needs to beplugged on an outlet we also have aauthentic action figure from one of thebest anime series that I like which ischainsaw man this is a Max Factory figmadenji figure which is a cool characterdesign especially its chainsaw man formit's worth buying if you're trying toget into animation or Anatomy just likeme but the catch is it's a veryexpensive one let's go back to thefunctioning side of this setup we have arazor siren mini as the microphone I'veused this for years already this is whatI've been using for trash talking backwhen I'm still playing a lot of videogames it's definitely a decent widecompact condenser microphone and whatyou're hearing right now is this exactmicrophone as well I've just put somefilters and enhancements and you getthis especially if I do record audiocloser just like this I would say it hassome quality of podcasting or cinematicaspect that you'll find on thosesomewhat professional audio stuff it'srelatively cheap which makes it one ofthe most worth buying parts of thisgaming desk setup to further enhance theitic looks of this gaming desk setup wehave some plant decorations that totalsto around $6 it's all fake but itdefinitely made the setup more livelierand that has a good contrast as wellwith the light Walnut Wood slates that Isticked on the wall it contributes tothe nature Vibe of this whole gamingdesk setup to finish things off we havethe ambient lighting for this gamingdesk setup we have some rechargeablelight cones that has a three differentcolor modes I use the warm light atnight when I'm studying and progrramming the white lights are for someoffice kind of vibe the good thing is itcan last close to a day when fullycharged but if it's gaming time alreadywe have some RGB LED light bars on theback which I've attached behind themonitor to give some lumination toincrease my FPS I don't know about thatbut always remember RGB equals FPS andwith all of that this gaming desk set upis complete I hope you enjoyed thisvideo drop a like if you did but if youstill want more of this make sure tosubscribe to to this Channel and to mysub Channel as well because that's whereI'll upload the other desk setup thatI'm going to be releasing it's relatedto productivity

dude the vibes is just so cozy, lakas maka aesthetic haha
I have the same laptop cooler for my Acer Predator Helios 16, with i5 13th gen and RTX 4050, it has a huge contribution in lowering the temps ! Must have for every laptop gamers.
I really like ASUS TUF A15 but considering the Lenovo LOQ 2024 i5 12450HX, RTX 4050 variant because it's cheaper, more powerful and really has that minimalistic feel to it. Though I don't usually go around glazing aesthetics. Yes, I am aware of the concerning Motherboard issues, but I think that the issue has become less likely to happen since I don't see anything about it anywhere.
Bro i need link of your monitor mount please
Angas ng set up mo idol , pwede po ptulong paano iset up nitong Armoury Crate for my better gaming experience sa Asus TUF15 ko dn ?

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Looks AMAZING DUDE !
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
I remember doing this for my room when I was getting my first gaming pc last year. I was suppose to only paint the corner of my room and then I ended up doing my whole room over and changing pretty much everything it was an amazing feeling when it came together.
I just revamped my room so this was pretty inspiring to add a couple more things in, loved it!
the pace of your storytelling is wonderful - not too slow to become boring but also not too fast to feel rush. I literally feel like Im actually living with you. You have a new subscriber here, thank you for making this vid
your video really motivates many people to re decor their rooms, as a full time college student and job, a side with streaming, i need to make my Room as Aesthetic as your room is now !
if i may give some more suggestions:
id recommend putting a curtain in front of your closet. it really blocks off the clutter plus i think a black curtain would look beautiful

i would personally also clean up the shelf above your setup a bit. there is a TON of stuff on it and the colors really clash agains the cozy vibe with your room. so if i were you id pick a few things i really like and put them on there, and the others somewhere else :D

overal, awesome video! i envy you!
The wood with the black was an AMAZING choice. I saw it before you even brought it up and went ""oooooooh thats gonna look good""
Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
That xenohunter knife is sick man (also your room)
this was a crazy transformation, you look MAD different since the last time we interacting and i'm glad to see you slowly killing the tech game. KEEP THIS SHIT UP
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
Im moving out soon and have been looking for room inspo. This gave me a clear idea of what I want my room to look like. Thanks a lot man
!!
Great video!!! stumbled upon it in my feed
Personally am a white/green with wood accents type of guy but I dig your overall update!
Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!
not gonna lie ... this turn out sick ... the way you turn this small room is so awesome... lot of love.
As many people are saying, the quality of this video and the editing are expected of a large channel! Keep at it, this was great!
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!
Love how dude just clipped his mic to his glasses
This video deserves a million views.
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
I’m so close to getting my dream setup I’ve been saving for a while now and have about 200$ I need way more but these type of videos inspire to keep saving up you’ve gained a new subscriber
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
don't remove the paper/seal on the PC with the PC on sometimes if its sealed to much it will cause static and maybe mess up ur pc for a bit but DW its ez to fix
man you deserve more subs, more views, more everything. You're a great youtuber and the fact you spent this much with only a small amount of subs has gotten you my respect.
How do you only have 11k man!?! Love the video and the whole design you went with, it's phenomenal! I eventually want to revamp my entire room and try and stream and make videos again!
first time watching you, and i have never ever stayed seated at my setup for that long just for a youtube video, keep it up man (great job with the editing)
Honestly, there isn't a lot of people make setup videos anymore and this was nice to see. Really great video and I'm definitely hitting that subscribe button. Keep up the great work!!! Sick setup!
this is amazing. You really did achieve a dream setup
Great Video! Loved the aesthetic. One small suggestion to get a black curtain to hide your closet + also keep dust and sunlight off your clothes.
I didn't expect this kind of quality from a channel with only 11k subs, great job bro keep it up!!
love the style you went for, amazing setup bro!
Loving the nice clean aesthetic of the room, and also the high end quality of the video itself. Seriously deserving of more attention. Keep up the great work man, you're doing an incredible job.
I'm yapping too much (12:30) is the most accurate statement ever!!
That wall with the black paint, the lights and the plant instantly improved the room, proper class! (Just needs to be not hidden by the bed! ) 2 mattresses though! I did that years ago and found it made my back worse! One of them was a cheapo one though, also do you notice much light coming through the canisteo window blinds? Look like they aren't flush to the sides if that makes sense?

Great set up BTW, room looks so much better after changing the decor!
It's always a treat finding Habesha YouTubers. Love ur vids gang
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
0:19 Not trying to be offensive or disrespectful, but low-key reminded me of Cookie from, ""Ned's Declassified. Which is an awesome character that brings charm to the group, which is my favorite when waiting for each episode.
room turned out dope!
love it dude! Im on my room revamping journey now as well. This helps a lot!
Boy 10/10 room bro you nailed it
this style IS the new ""rgb"" style
You just got another sub bro! Love the raw and genuine content.
setup looks crazyyy
I’m new to the channel and I can already tell you got potential. It was such a chill video I genuinely enjoyed it. And the end product Keep up the good work
love the new vibe! great video!
Room came out super clean plus bro watching the mighty pod
Holy moly, even your ""start look"" of the room looks good to me, mine is just a desk with my computer stuff and audio hardware with mic haha
great video bro, i cant believe u managed to change ur entire room like that
I’d put led lights along the top of the wood panels personally but this set up looks amazing
This is just wow! U did a grat job tho on the designs and on litterlay every detail on ur room. nice one :D
I've been meaning to get around to a room renovation for about a year + now, and I'm building a new PC soon so I'm going to do that soon as well. Thanks for the inspo brother :)
I don't usually leave comments, but your video was super smooth and the music gave such a nice vibe! You've actually got me thinking about tidying up my room. You've got yourself a new subscriber!(I use chatgpt to translate. sorry if its weird :D)
my man is reading cs lewis, the goat.
That’s basically my dream setup, amazing vid, subscribed
Really enjoyed watching this video man, keep up the great work!
Great use of the space you have and great setup upgrades. Keep grinding my guy!!
im addicted to making setup videos..
this ISN'T A PHASE!
i love the struggle of a creator with a million creativity, mic on glasses lol. reminds me of myself recording using a cellphone covered in socks, btw I really like that strips wooden wall
9:28 the techsource mouse pad goes har
If those lights that worked on transfer are the same ones, then you likely just had an unseated plug somewhere. The vibrations of the fans and pump will unseat connectors over time if they're not secured properly.
Setup looks clean, my dude. Definitely got some inspiration while watching this, so thanks for that!
your setup looks amazing I really enjoyed watching the process of you setting up your Dream Cozy Room/setup, I'm subbed to your channel because I want to watch you grow.
Clean setup looks much better
It would have looked better to take the panelling the full length of the wall and then paint the top and bottom of the wall black, that would have made those panels pop more, and a black blind to break up the white window wall would look nicer imo. Definitely an improvement to how it was originally, looks great
You should get a Mini fridge next to your setup and go to the nearest smith’s and get your favorite drinks would you like to drink…!
So clean brother!
Great quality & great vibes! Keep it up man
looks so good !! holy crap
Nice fricking video dude. U absolutely nailed it!!
Black PC for the win!!
Nice room upgrade, I so desperately need to do mine, Im in my mid-20s, still living with my parents and my room is still the colors and mid wall hight wallpaper border I had when I was a kid. I did do some moving round of things but needs a huge refresh. Hopefully this summer I can get the rest of my desk built, right now my desk top is sitting on top of another desk thats my moms so its not ideal as the desptop uangs off a lot on both sides.

Welcome back to mychannel. And if you're new here, hey,I'm Patricia, a 20something year oldliving in Atlanta, Georgia. For today'svideo, I wanted to do like a desk setuptour. I feel like I've accumulated a lotof stuff while, you know, having asetup. I've had it for about like threethree-ish years. And if you watched mylast setup tour, then you kind ofalready get the gist. But I did removesome stuff, minimize it a little bitcompared to like how my setup was waybefore when I had like my LED lights,all that extra stuff. But enoughyapping. Let's get into it. Let's justjump in and start with the peripherals,the setup, you know, the main stuff thatmakes a setup what it is. By the way, Iwill be linking everything in my setup,majority of everything, as much as I canin the description below. So, pleasecheck that out. And if I did leaveanything out or if you had anyadditional questions, just drop it downbelow and I'll try to get to it. Let'sget into the PC. So, I got my PCpre-built and I got it from RGB CustomPC. I know there's like a lot ofcontroversy currently with them cuz Igot a comment recently and they waslike, ""Oh, have you heard what's beengoing on? I guess some people aren'tgetting their PCs after like a month. Idon't know what's going on over there.""So, you know, just do your research.Figure out which company you want to geta pre-built from if you want to go thepre-built route or you can get the partsindividually and build yourself. Butyeah, I got a pre-built just because Idon't know PC stuff. I don't know how tobuild anything and I didn't want tolearn just because I was lazy at thetime. So, I was like, ""Yeah, let's justgo the easier route."" This was also likekind of during co so I was like, ""Thiswas the cost effective route for me.""Originally, when I ordered from RGBCustom, I didn't have any issues.Honestly, I got my PC like a week and ahalf after and I got status updateswhenever they were building it, whatupdates they were making when they werein the checking stages. And that's theonly experience I have with buying froma pre-built company. That's why I'mtelling you all my experience. But justbe wary, you know, like do your ownresearch. Figure out where you want toget yours from. For my specs, I'll putthem on the screen and also in thedescription below. This is she. And thenI got this chromi cute Funko Pop justchilling in there. And then the interior[Music]This PC cost me like about like 2,000something only because I got another PCfrom them. Originally it was like a pinkcase and it wasn't a three tier likethis. It was like just two tier andsomething happened. It broke. I sent itback to them and then I was like since Isent it back to them let me like upgradeit which I did and that cost me just alittle bit more. So I changed the case.They added an extra fan and then theyfixed the piece that was originallywrong with this PC. I honestly do wantto upgrade her though because I don'tknow. My friend Nomi, shout out Nomi, umshe built her PC and it looksphenomenal. Who knows, maybe I'll askfor her help and see how I can upgradeit because like this is cute and I'mkind of liking how she did it. It waslike a glass case here as well as overhere and then you you can just see theinterior more, you know? But this is notbad. Like I still love my PC. It's myvery first PC. And then to decorate it,similar to have the chromy inside, Ihave this cute little sunny angel andthen a Kirby and then a Miffy light. Itactually turnson. Super cute. But that is my PC andshe gets the job done, y'all. Like Iedit all my YouTube videos on here. Igame, record YouTube videos on OBSperfectly fine. And then I also am goingto start streaming soon. So let's seehow she holds up. So far after like thatinitial problem that I had with myoriginal PC and sent it back and gother. Um I don't think I had any issuesafter that. I actually lied. I hadanother issue with my PC. Um now that Ithink about it, something died again,but this time I brought it to MicroCenter and then they were able to fixit, but they had to wipe my entire PCbecause something got lost in thememory. But besides those two times, thePC has held up. Yeah, technicaldifficulties, but you know, that's thatcomes with, you know, having a PC.Enough about the PC, y'all. I feel likeI just been yapping about it forever.Now, on to the peripherals. So, theseare some HP monitors that I have. And Igot these monitors like 3 years agobefore the boycotting. This is just thebrand that I got cuz I went toMicroEnter and they had a deal and Ididn't want to spend crazy money. Butthese monitors are the HP. It's like 27in something. And I think the hertz is165 if I remember correctly. She hasheld up perfectly fine. Haven't had anissue with the monitors at all. And thenI got this cute little background fromGoogle. But I would usually use like umwallpaper engine. But you know sometimeswhen I'm editing I don't want to likehave the wallpaper engine. It's like ananimated wallpaper. It just it gets verydistracting. So I turn that off wheneverI'm editing and then I kind of forgot toturn it back on. So we're just chillingwith Spirited Away wallpaper for today.Sunny Angels. Sunny Angels on themonitors is a must. Okay. And then I gotmy Elgato face cam. This is what I'vebeen like recording my gameplay with.Sooner or later, who knows? Maybe I'llconnect my camera to see if I can usethat as a camera on Twitch just so I getclearer quality. And sorry about mycable management, y'all. Oh my god,that's I can't. We We don't talk abouther. But I did try to make it look nice.Um, speaking of that, like, as you guyscan see, my dual monitor mounts. Okay,got these from Amazon. They have like alittle bit of cable management help aidright there, but it doesn't do that muchhelp, honestly. So, honestly, I'mprobably going to see if I can get adifferent monitor mount just becauselike I feel like it's it's protrudingout a lot. Like, originally, I thoughtthese monitor mounts was going to belike closer to the wall, but yeah. Whoknows? That's just me complaining. Butso far, the mounts are okay. I'mprobably going to change it, but that'swhat I'm using currently. I just likethat they're white and they kind ofblend in with the desk. And then for mykeyboard, I kind of forgot where I gotmy keyboard. Having a massive brain fartand I can't remember. I think it wassent to me from a company. The name onthe USB is Yaola. A U L A. But yes, Ilove her so much. Like it's very simple.It's not over the top. The colorways arevery like basic and simple and it goeswith my setup pretty well. And they havevarious different light patterns.[Applause][Music]Yes, love this keyboard so much. Andit's not super long, too. Like, it'sjust a very standard keyboard size. Andyou guys are probably wondering, okay,but what is that like light in the back?I got y'all. Don't talk about my cables.But yeah, this is like a goi light thatI have on both my monitors. You canchange the color, but right now I justhave it on the white colorway. And youcould see the other one right here. Itjust gives your monitor and your setuplike a nice ambient lighting and alsohelps with the eyes like at night. On tothe next item is this adorable speaker.This is the Doom Ditto. They come invarious different colors. There's a pinkone, there's a white one, a green one,and then that's all I know off the topof my head. It's so tiny and compact,but it's strong. Like, the sound isthere, y'all. I brought this to a picnicone time, and it worked perfectly. Thisis my go-to speaker that I use wheneverI'm not using headphones. And then ithas these like animations, graphics,whatever you want to call it. Like ithas this cute BTS one. And then you canput the volume up, you can put thevolume down. There's a clock, but theseare the ones that I didn't get. Theycome with the actual device. So then ifyou need to change it, you just go tothe D Voom app. And then it connects toBluetooth and that's how you use it as aspeaker. And then the next piece, Itotally forgot this y'all. So this islike a cord coil for your keyboard. It'sjust there purposely for aesthetics. Andyou know, I'm here for it. I got thisfrom Glorious. And they have variousdifferent colors, but I just went withthe white one because I was like, it'svery simple and it's going to go with mysetup. And yeah, you just connect it toyour keyboard. Just there foraesthetics, and I'm here for it. Andthen this mouse, this is not my mousethat I usually use. I'm letting myboyfriend use my glorious mouse, so Ijust grabbed it from him. Um, it is awireless mouse. I feel like it just fitsmy hand perfectly, you know? Like it'snot super big. Just look at the colors.It's just very simple white and then ithas like accent colors which is supercute and they're the basic like RGBombre which matches my PC. Y'all see thedifference? Like this is just a littlebit bigger. And I got this from Amazon.It was like my first mouse. And then Iwent to Microsenter. I was like, ""Oh,okay. Let's upgrade."" And I got this badboy. And I love it. Like everybody needsa wireless mouse. It just comes in handylike when you're when you're gaming. Youcould just do all this stuff. And yeah,I obviously don't know how to explaintech that well in tech terms, but Idefinitely know how to do it in girlypop terms. And it's very cute. Now, onto this lovely guy that I haven't evenset up that I had for a year. I am goingto set this up probably after thisvideo. It's a stream deck. I want to putlike some cool sounds, transitions, allthat stuff that can help with my stream.But yeah, don't even lowkey forgot howto like set this set it up. Honestly,don't have much to say because I haven'tused it, but I'm excited to use it. TheRazor desk mat, but I love her. Again,it's just very simple. Um, it's not toolarge. Like, you know, some desk matslike it reaches all the way up here.This is just very like in one area. It'slike half of a desk. And I love it. Ikind of prepared myself that I knew likethis desk mat would get dirty because itis gray. It's a light gray color. But,you know, I think a little washing willhelp. And also, cool fact, this rimaround the mat lights up. I justcurrently don't have it plugged in rightnow. But yeah, you can manage thatthrough the Razer app, I believe. Andlike you can pick and choose whichcolors you want. Or you can do like aombre, which is pretty neat, likeespecially when you're gaming late atnight or just on your PC watchingsomething. And then it's like a coollike, you know, cute ombre, a subtle asubtle ombre. And then another piece ofmy perfumes is my HyperX mic. I got theblack color way before they had thewhite colorway come out. So, I'm so mad,but who knows, maybe around my birthdayor Christmas, I will get the white colorway. But for now, she's doing what shehas to do. Um, gets the job done. Andthen the arm is just this super cheaparm that I got from Amazon like yearsago when I first started getting stufffor my setup. And then you can changethe base with this, I believe. And inthe back they have like a notch to likedetermine how do you want this mic topick up how you're talking. Like do youwant it to be all around? Do you want itto be on the side? Like are yourecording with multiple people and youwant them to catch them as well or not?So yeah, this mic is pretty cool. Butyeah, that is my peripherals y'all. MyPC, kind of some decor that I got on it.Desk mat, keyboard, not the mouse that Iusually use, but I'm using it currently.two monitors, mic arm for the mic,keyboard, speaker, stream deck, webcam,and then some decor. Very simple andstraight to the point for a feels. Ihave this white gaming chair. I used tohave the pink GRCing one and then I soldit. It was too bright, you know? I kindof grew out of having like a pink gamingchair. It was cute for the moment, but Ijust wasn't feeling it. So, I got thiswhite one and I love it. It's verycomfortable and like it has this likepattern on it. There's cushion on thereand then a cool feature and it's like afootrest or leg rest or whatever you maycall it. Yeah, I think this is like theeco something style kind of chair. It'slike good for your back or whatever. Andthen the desk. This desk is from IKEA,but it's just like your regular decularIKEA desk. Um I low key need to likeinstall a like a third leg in themiddle. I don't know if you guysnoticed, but like my desk is like it'sround in the middle. like it's dentingin the middle. You'll see that. So, Ithink I need to install a third leg forthat support. And I blame it on themonitors. Like, they're so heavy. Thisdesk is also from IKEA. It's just like asmaller version of this desk. But thisone has more wear and tear just becauseI had this mic arm right here. And Inoticed that I didn't have it all theway in. So, it was kind of like pullingat it whenever I was moving my mic. Butnow, I moved it backwards and I have itlike super good in there. But yeah, youcan see the damage. My god. But I've hadthis desk for like ever since thebeginning. So, 3 years. And that is myperipherals. And now, let's move on tothe cutesy stuff over here that makes mydesk setup like my desk setup. Like Isaid, these are two separate desks. So,like you're going to see this lineregardless. Oh, and then this is abetter view of my monitor mounts. Like,you see how far they come out? I don'tlike that. Like I feel like if I hadthem closer to the wall, I'll have morespace to like, you know, actually gameand just to do stuff, you know? It'staking up half of the desk basically. Sothis is my headset. This is the Razerheadset. Like it's not the wireless one.It has wires. They originally didn'tcome with these cat ears. I bought themseparately and just like attach them on.I know people say they're heavy and Ican see that. That's why I kind of likego in between them and also like myregular ear pods. Of course, I have alittle Kirby right here to accompany theheadphones. And then this little gadgetright here is like a label printer. Iuse this like whenever I go on trips andI need to label something real quick. Itcomes in handy. And you guys areprobably wondering like, okay, what isthis contraption? What is this? It'skind of like a desk bookshelf organizer.And my boyfriend's dad built this forme. I know I got a lot of questionsabout that. And she's stunning. Oh mygoodness. But yeah, we'll get into her.Don't mind this. This is just anotherlike dent in this desk. But yeah,underneath the bookshelf organizer, Ihave like these compartments of stuff.This is just remotes that I have tocontrol stuff. And then the second oneis like hand sanitizer, lippy stuff. Andthen the third one is just wires. Then Ihave some manga on display. We have thewhole series of What the Koi. So that's1 through six. And then we have In theClear Moonlight Dusk, 1 through 5. Andthat's not the whole series. I haven'tcollected manga in a minute, y'all. So Iknow I'm behind. But yes, as you guyscan tell from this, I'm a shojo girly. Ilove romance. Hopeless romantic. Okay.And I love reading about it. And nowabove it, I have just some cutetrinkets. This is another This is dead,by the way. I should have charged it.But it's similar to the Ditto overthere. Like you see how it has that cutescreen on there? This does the samething. And it's also a speaker. Supertiny. And you can put like animatedartwork on there to have on display.I'll charge this actually. And then Ihave some trinkets, blind boxes on here.This is from PopMart. It's the Herono. Iforgot which series, but this one'ssuper cute. This is also from PopMart.This is the Peach Riot version. And thenthis is a mythy blind box that I gotfrom Kinounia. And it comes with alittle Miffy. And then I have thiscapital pin um that I like keep rightthere. This is how it looks. It looksbare right now because I took thespeaker and I'm charging it right now.Now, right here, there's a middlecompartment in between like the twomanga areas, which I use for like, youknow, random stuff. So, I have thisHello Kitty notepad that fits perfectlyin there for whenever I need to quicklyjot something down. And if you guyscouldn't tell, I'm a BTS army, okay? So,I had the Butter album just chilling inthere. And y'all look how perfect itfits. Oh, it was like it was made forthat. And then this fits in pretty well,too. And since I'm an army, if you'renew here, I kind of want to see like,can you guess who my bias is? Now, on tomore manga. I have six volumes of Signof Affection. And in the back overthere, I have a Japanese version of Signof Affection. And then I have volumes 1through six of Blue Spring Ride. Andagain, these are all Showjo. No shame inthat. Okay. And then I have a lovelySmitzky right there protecting themanga. And now above all that manga, wehave more trinkets. So, we have thiscute Kirby. It's like a mochi Kirby. Igot this at Mini. So, the next figure isa Hatsune Miku one. This is the Sherryversion. I got this at an animeconvention. And then this little likecup. It's like a Spirited Away teacupthat I got from Barnes & Nobles. I thinkI just put some of my cute pens that Ihave. Like this is a BTS pen. This is acute pen. Um yeah, just all these cutepens. Look at that. Oh, and then Iforgot this guy. And then this isanother version of Kirby. And I justkeep that like right there. And nowbehind Hatune Miku, I have this anotherlike gadget. This is again from Doom.This isn't a speaker though. It's justlike it just adds some cool ambiancelighting. Let's see if it'sdead. It's dead. I'm going to chargethis so I can show youall what it lookslike. But it's very cool. Like you canchange the lighting with this. And theyhave various different options. And thenthis photo card in the back. Minyongifrom DTS. This is my bias if y'allwasn't able to guess it in time. I havethese cute little prints that I got fromShutterfly and I think they were free. Ijust had to pay for shipping at the timecuz they were doing a deal. They justlike spice up the wall a little bit. Nowon to my pegboard that I got from IKEA.This is like the standard size pegboard.It's not the large one. It's just theregular one. And then to decorate it, Igot these like little pieces that theyalso had. So these are just some keysthat I have for keyboards. And I thoughtit was cute to put them on display. Andthen I have this Herono figure. I forgotwhich series, but y'all, he fitsperfectly right there. Oh my goodness.And then next to it, I have thisportable CD player that I got fromAmazon. And then of course, a new jeansCD album. And this is the remote thatgoes with it. I don't even know if it'splugged in though. Pretty well. Like thesound isn't too bad, but you know, it'snot like um a surround sound type ofanything. But for like 20 or $25, it'spretty good. Nostalgic. And then we moveup a little bit and we have my Apple AirMaxes. And then over here, this is JunkCoup. He's my bias recorder or honestlyhe may be like handinhand but with Yi.And then I have myAirPods. I forgot what this thing iscalled. Is it Pochica? Um but it's fromChainsaw Man. Andoh, and I got that from an animeconvention. It's just so cute. And atthe very top of the pegboard, I havemore blind box figures. They're eitherthe Herono series or the Peach Riotseries. And aren't they just so cute?Like these girls right here, they are socool. And Heronos are just like oddlyweird, but I love it. And then chill inthe corner is of course a Sunny. Itotally forgot to show y'all this blindbox figure. But this is another PeachRiot. This is Frankie. And she'sprobably my favorite out of the three.Like look at that. She looks so cool. Somy favorite would probably be Frankie,Poppy, and then I don't even know this.Is it Gigi? Is that her name? This iswhere I keep all my like markers,highlighters, pens, rulers, erasers, allthat stuff. And then, of course, a Kirbyjust chilling. But yeah, that iseverything on this side table that Ihave. And it's a lot, but I feel likeit's it's not over the top, you know,like it's very tasteful and simple, butkind of like maximist in a way, but verycutesy and trinkety. And y'all get it,right? And I love how everything justblends together so seamlessly and likeit doesn't look too much but it's justenough, you know, very girly, mangarelated, K-pop related. And yeah,underneath my desk setup, I have thisMiffy rug that me and my boyfriend made.We went to like a tufting class for ouranniversary. And this is the contraptionthat I created. It doesn't even looklike Miffy. It looks like Miffy oncrack, but you know, um, memories. So Iwas like, this is very cute. Then I havea trash can. And then I have some cablemanagement right here underneath, whichdoesn't even look all that good, y'all.Like cable management and me do not gohand in hand. So you see thisloveliness. And you go underhere. What is that? Jump scare. Jumpscare. Okay, this is the cablemanagement that I tried to make work,but I kind of got lazy in the midst ofit. And then it's just like a bundle abundle of wires. It's just a bundle ofwires. But next to it, I have like somemore stuff, you know, miscellaneousstuff. This is a controller that I usesometimes. This is like the handle forthat mic right there. So, if I wanted toput it on the table, I could. And thenright here, this is like for mystationary giries. Washitape. Okay. I just have a bunch of washitape. A cute littlestapler. More washi tape. A littlenotepad. Stickers. So, like whenever Ido giveaways or whatever, I like to givethe winners like these stuff. Just somerandom stuff. Write them a note. And Igot this Miffy sticker thingy. And thenthese are more Myiffy stickers. This iscinnamon rollstickers. My melody stickers. Literally,y'all, I have somuch. And then on the third row, it'sjust like a lot of like sticky notes.And then I got this eraser from MountFuji. And then when you erase it, it'slike it's shaped like Mount Fuji. Moresticky notes and stuff, tabs, likey'all, just stationary heaven, if I mustsay. Underneath all that, I have like mybig K-pop photos that does not fit in myphoto album book that I have cuz I havelike a main one that like suits all thesmall ones, the small photos, but theseare like super big. We have junk cook.More junk cookook.Yi tay. And then this whole compartmentorganizer thing. I got this from IKEA.And it's just like so much stuff, y'all.Like I am probably not going to gothrough it one because it's notorganized and it's a lot. I have likeNintendo cases. This is my K-pop albumbook that I was going to show y'all.Okay. And this is my K-pop album book.It's nothing crazy. I know people havelike so much, but I just have like, youknow, I just have New Jeans and BTSbecause those are the two albums that Ipurchased before. I don't purchase K-popalbums crazy though. And like I said, Iwas going to show y'all how this Voomthing works. I think it's the DoomPlanet 9 or something. But yeah, if youjust twist this knob at the top, it haslike all these color options. It justkind of just adds some fun color to yoursetup. I'll probably leave it on thatone. That one's cute, right? And thenthis one, this is how it looks. I haveto like connect it with the D Voom app,but you guys get the point. We have likea cute animation on here. But yeah, thatis my setup, y'all, in a nutshell.Overall, a lot of the stuff in my setupI purchased myself. Uh there is stuffhere and there that was gifted to me. Alot of it came out of pocket, but worthit though because I absolutely love howmy setup turned out. But I'm glad I wasable to share my setup with you guysbecause I know some of y'all who are newhere had some questions and wonderingwhere I got stuff. If you made it thisfar into the video, I just want to thankyou so so much for watching. I hope youenjoyed. And if you did, please makesure to like, comment, and subscribe.That was actually so much fun justyapping about my setup. So, I reallyhope you all enjoyed. Bye guys. See youin the next video.[Music]Heat. Heat.","back from a little hiatus, i missed y'all! <3
seeing your serup over the years is craazy cause it's stayed relativley the same but it's still always shocks me?! it's so beautiful.
your desk setup looks very comfortable to work and lounge in, love it
I also have the Aula keyboard! I love it so much, but I changed the keycaps to the Osume Dalgona keys. So it's a pretty, cozy brown color. Like coffee!
Hello Queen! Amazingly cute setup! Sorry to provide unsolicited advice, but I always recommend for gaming and work desk setups to get custom cut plexiglass for tabletops. Just take the tabletop measurements down to Lowe's Depot and they cut it to fit and it's cheap. Protects your desktop, easy to clean, and you can decorate under the plexi with photos and such. Love it for my WFH + gaming setup. 
What games are you playing?
I've been addicted to ESO since 2015 and now Diablo 4. Still dabble in FN, but I'm horrible.
Litterly soo stinking cuteee and ilysmm
Love your desk set and I love spirit away
Whoa! This setup is amazing
for the monitor mount use a piece of 1in wood on top the mount and under neath the mount to take the sag out it helped me cause i use 3 monitors
So cute!
I got a prebuilt from RGBcustoms too back in Dec 2023 and I was lucky to get it before stuff went down. I got a free livestream to watch too because I was already hanging out in streams for about a year before I bought. But about a few months after getting my pc apparently they filed for bankruptcy, shut down their store and sites and didn't send some ppl's pcs out so that was a shock. A shame cause I really liked them and would've bought from them again in the future. 

Anyways your setup is really cute~
I love to hear patricia yap
heyyyyy YouTube fam
Hey Army! Definitely Suga Bias!

Over the years, I've builtsetups for my friends and family, whilemy own setup has been collecting dust.So, with the help of a few companies andsome questionable financial choices, letus begin the room building process. Allright, this is the current state of theroom. This is embarrassing. I'm notgoing to lie. It is a mess in here. Ijust got back from traveling a coupledays ago. But the reason why my room islike this really doesn't matter. Whatmatters is that I've been kind ofuninspired. My room has been pretty muchthe same for the past like 3 years.There's been little touches of decorthat I've added, but overall layout, thecolor scheme, everything, like it's allbeen the same. I haven't really knownwhat to upgrade or what to change. Butafter like years of reflecting on mysetup and then having recently built myfriend a setup, thank you guys for thesupport by the way. But after doingthat, it's made me want to kind ofchange up my room. Like it's really allI've been looking forward to the pastcouple of days. I think I want to startto or completely take apart this setupbecause I want to just have the one setup here. And this will clear up morespace. I want to rotate my bed so it'slike this way and have more space overthere. And a part of me kind of wants topaint my walls like this one and thatone. I don't have any experience withpainting. I've just been watching TikToks on like how to do it. I've alreadyhad like a general idea on how to do it,but I think it would be so perfect. Butright now, I just want to clean up myroom and kind of prep for[Music]tomorrow. All right. So, the wall hasbeen prepped. I put masking tape. Ithink that's what you're supposed to do.I rotated the bed. Everything is likevery slowly coming together. We stillhave a whole lot to do. I said this lastnight. I've never like painted myselfbefore. I'm a 22-year-old man. But Ireally don't think it's that hard. Imight eat my words later, but I'm prettysure prepping is harder than likeactually painting, you know, especiallyif you're doing like a whole room. ThatI understand. I was thinking about doingthis side too, like where my setup TVis, all that. But I don't know. There'sa lot of stuff to move out the way. Idon't mind just doing this side cuz if Iwas to stream, right, the backgroundwould be black and I'm probably going toput my nano leafs back there. So, Ithink it's fine. Can you tell I'm makingimpulsive decisions? I need supplies topaint this though. And um I need paint,too. So, I think I'm going to go getthat. I have a Home Depot maybe like 510 minutes away from where I live. So,[Music]yeah. Allright, Home Depot was a success. Goteverything I needed. We have the dropcloth down here. We have the black paintright outside. I'm going to grab it in asecond. It doesn't quite go all the way,which might be a problem, but I think wehave another one sitting around thehouse. I might like call my mom and askher, but we should be good to go. Thelady who gave me the paint, she told meI could pull it off with one coat andlike get it done today. That's what Itold her. I told her I want to get itdone today. But with that, I told herI'm still probably going to do two coatsjust to make sure it's got like a goodfinish. And I'm not really in a rushfrom now. It's noon right now. So, whatI finished it within an hour or two, letit chill for like 3 hours, maybe four,and apply another coat. But either way,um, this wall is not going to paintitself. So, we got to get started.[Music][Music]Okay, I think some of my audio had cutout this morning, but this is the wall.I got some things put up. I got the nanoleaves. I have my smaller trianglepanels. I put an IKEA plant in thatcorner. I haven't had any plants in myroom for a couple years and we had onedownstairs, so I figured I'd snatch it.My humble opinion, I think it looksbetter there. Something I want to do, Idon't know if I'll do it for this video,but I want to get one of those likestanding lights to go behind the light.Go, if you're watching this, I love you.All of my lights are from you. Butagain, that's just something I want todo. Something I thought I'd mention.This is looking nice, bro. Especiallyfor like a video background or a streambackground. I feel like the black worksreally well with the plant, the lights.It's looking good. and the room as awhole is looking good. Speaking ofwhich, I think the next thing I'm goingto work on is a little bit of the setup.I don't know if you saw in thebackground, I have these wood panels.They're going to replace the sort offoam soundproof panels that I havecurrently. I really like the wood look.I feel like it would fit the setupreally well, especially with a blackcountertop. I don't know if I mentionedthat. I'm going to be doing that. And Ijust think it'll help achieve that sortof work vibe, but also like cozy. I feellike if I want to spice it up, I canalways turn on the RGB. Some more thingshave arrived and I don't think I'll setthem up tonight. It's 7:00 p.m. rightnow. I'm talking new desk, TV, chair,whatever you're thinking of, I probablybought it. Now, I'm very excited to setthose up. But first, the wood[Music]panels. All[Music]right, we have the wall panels put up. Idid most of this last night, but bro,this looks so good. The greenery andsome of the plants as well make it lookso much better. This obviously isn't thefinal product, but we're slowly gettingthere, bro. I know I look crusty, musty,dusty, but literally like the second Iwoke up, I just got to cleaning up theroom. I had a lot of open boxes andtrash and it was getting kind of filledup in here. So, I felt like I had tomove some things. I'm becoming more okaywith not painting this wall just becausethe wood takes up so much space. So, itkind of gives off that like darker lookalready. Like I don't need to paint itblack. And then with some of the otherchanges coming in, like I have a white,not white, a black nightstand coming in,a black dresser coming in, blacktabletop and black bed I need to pickup. Like I'm not kidding. I'm doing likea full revamp, bro. I'm tired of thislike whole white theme. But as for rightnow, uh my back has been killing me. I'mnot going to lie. Most of you know Idon't have a chair. I'll probably likedo some Tik Toks about that. But here wehave a new office chair from FlexisSpot. I need to set that up. This Ibought myself because I've been needinga chair desperately, but I will talkabout Flexis Spot more as the video goeson. They've actually helped with thisproject. They sent out some products.More on them soon, though. For now, umthis chair, I I need it bad.[Music]I need to[Music]see. You don't know how much I've neededa good chair. I made a Tik Tok sometimelast year where I bought a Teimu chairto see if it was actually good. And itwas good for a couple weeks and then itlike started leaning back and itwouldn't go back in place. I don't knowif that's cuz I'm a big back or just cuzthe chair was like 30 bucks. But longstory short, I have been making myselfsuffer cuz I have not been buying achair. Even during my trip to Florida inmy last video, you guys didn't see it oncamera obviously, but literally everyday I foam roll. Like I was havingterrible back pain beforehand. I'm suremy awful chair contributed a little bit.And just the fact that I'm likeconstantly sitting down, whether that'slike editing, doing homework, streaming,even like sitting while I work, I wasnot treating my back nicely. And thisinvestment was definitely worth it.Yeah. Uh, we got it all set up. It feelsgood. Like I said, like I just glazedfor like 2 minutes. It's got everythingyou can need. You could like rotate thearmrests. You could lock your positionlike how far it leans back. There'slumbar support like for your lower back.There's even like a like a foot rest orlike a leg rest, which I didn't knowthis came with. I could really just kickit. Matter of fact, bro, hold on. Wo!Oh, it like recline. Yo, it like fullyrecines and then you can lock it inplace. Oh my goodness, bro. This is sucha vibe, bro. This is so relieving.Again, this like this bit, this is notsponsored. Like, this I I bought with myown money. We'll see how it holds upover time, but would I recommend it? Sofar, yes. Bro, let me like face you guyswhen I talk. I feel like I'm being rude.As far as what to do next, uh, a coupledays ago, I had placed an order for Imentioned a black bed, so a new bed. Andthen my thinking is I think I want tobuild the bed last just cuz like I'm notgoing to lie, like painting, moving alot of stuff around. There's a littlebit of dust. I don't want to puttogether my new bed with like a newcomforter and everything, new sheets. Idon't want to do all that just to likeaccumulate more dust. I feel like itwould just make sense to save that forlast. I have a 4K TV sitting outsidehere as well that I ordered. I don'tknow if I want to do that now. Mainlybecause I want to buy those like go likeyou know the lights that like respond tothe colors of whatever you're watching.I want to buy those before settingeverything up. But instead ofoverthinking and not knowing what to do,I have an idea. Let me move you guys outthe way for a second. Honestly, I thinkI'm going to do a quick case swap.Essentially, my plan is to just go froma white PC case to a black one. And Ithink it'll really just like help fitthe look and have the setup cometogether. I feel like if I kept a whitePC case with all the upgrades I'm doingwith like the black countertop and justthe overall like darker aesthetic overhere, I feel like it would just stickout like a sore thumb. But yeah, um ifyou've ever done any PC building, anycase swapping, anything, this couldeither take an hour or a couple days.And I'm hoping it's about an hour, maybeeven less. I don't know. I haven'tmessed with my PC in a while.[Music]Are you[Music]ready? All[Music]right. Um, I don't know what was goingthrough my head when I said this wouldtake an hour. It ended up taking six,which is faster than a couple of days,but I don't know. I was kind of hoping Iwould get it done sooner. I'm just happyI got it done like same day. No reallike major issues. Long story short,case swap went well. I love the black.Everything looks good. The RGB and myfans work. For some reason, some of thelights were dying like in my old case,but now they're fine. So, hopefully itstays that way. I have some morepackages that have came in. Comment ifyou know where this knife is from. AndI'll give you a cookie. Uh, it's notdoing a whole lot of cutting. I don'tknow if you can tell what this is. Imean, ignore that I still have to peelthis blue off, but you know those likecircular like traffic mirrors like youusually see them in like parking garagesor Yeah, mainly parking garages. That'swhat this is. I thought it'd be like acool piece of decor. I've seen I thinklike on Pinterest a little bit of TikTok. People have it like up in thecorner of their room. One, you get likesuper cool selfies and it's just a nicepiece of decor. Something that like noteverybody has. I don't think it's toodifficult to set up either. Um, do youscrew this to the wall or drill this? II don't know. I don't know why I'masking you. Like you guys know theanswer as well. Now, the mirror is cooland all, but these packages are a lotmore exciting. First, we have TV lights.Walk with me here. Walk with me here.Then, we have a TV mount. You see this?You like that stuff? You see what we'redoing here? And finally, this got here acouple days ago, but I'm only just nowopening it and like showing youguys new TV. Same size as my old one. 43in. Just cuz like I know I don't havethe most space. And 43 in, that's prettybig.pause. And it's 4K, which is the mainthing I've been looking for since I'vebeen like recording and editing in 4K.Looking at 1080p now feels so weird.Like I can do it, but it really is true.Once you go to like 1440, once you go to4K, and then you go back to 1080, it'sterrible. It's so good. I think I'mgoing to I'm going to put the lights onhere. I'm going to take my old TV down,take the mount off, and then I mean, ifall goes to plan, we could probably setthis up within like seriously this timein like an hour, maybe two. I I don'tknow. I need to just do it. I'm yappingtoo[Music]much. Okay, I need to stop filling myhead with these delusions, bro. Iliterally rage quit. I rage quitmounting the TV, bro. I found the studsand everything. Like, I have a detectorfor it. I think I was just being anidiot and like couldn't get it figuredout, but I needed a break from it justcuz like I was getting tired. I wasgetting really, really annoyed. So, Ifigured it would be best to take a breakfor a bit. I returned a package from mymom. And then while I was doing that, Ifigured I would stop by IKEA and pick upsome stuff. Here I have the blackcountertop and then I have a new bed.Still a twin bed. I know it's small, butlike I've had twin beds my whole life.And I could probably make like a fullsize work, but it would be pushing it ifI want to fit more in my room. So, Idon't I don't feel like doing I couldlive with a twin bed, but I'll be backhome in like 5 minutes. I think I'mgoing to start Well, I want to finishgetting the TV mounted. I think I canget that done. I I really just needed abreak. And then from there, I think I'mgoing to work on the setup, bro, and getthe desk swapped. That's probably goingto take me like the rest of today, justcuz I'm going to try and cable manage,too. But it'll all be worth it if I canget the bulk of it done today. The lastcouple of things that are still on theway are the dresser and nightstand, bothin black, and then a new monitor. 27 in1440p. Those are like the main missingpieces. Dude, I cannot wait to be done.Let me know if you guys are[Music]enjoying. All right, the TV is upfinally. We're making really goodprogress so far. I have the lightsbehind them that are responding towhat's on the TV. I don't know if youguys can tell, but that's pretty good.And I even put up the little trafficmirror that I had got. I think it looksgood in that corner. I will say I doneed to mount it a little more securely.Everything with the room has been goingsmoothly. And now I think I need to workon the setup. Besides my bed, obviouslymy setup and my desk is where I'm goingto be the most often, which is why Iwant to give a big thank you toFlexispot for even making this wholeroom revamp possible. Look, having ahigh-quality desk is by far the mostimportant piece of any gaming setup,office space, you name it. And withFlexis Spots E6 dual motor desk, highquality is exactly what you get. Withsuper simple instructions and amazingbuild quality, I face no issues whenputting this together, which only tookme about an hour. Something I have totalk about is how smooth the deskoperates. With the included controller,you can easily adjust your desk untilyou get that perfect height. And what'seven better is that with the four memorybuttons, you can make presets of theexact heights you like to work from,which is super clutch because you canliterally go from sitting to standingand vice versa with the press of abutton. This is practical for me becauseI do a lot of work at my setup where I'mconstantly sitting for hours on end. Butnow with this, I can easily give my backthe break that it deserves. The deskitself is also extremely sturdy anddoesn't feel cheap in the slightest. Asyou can see, I have two monitors, a PC,a MacBook, and loads of accessories, alladding weight to the desk, and it stilloperates flawlessly. I'm not going tolie, I've even accidentally bumped intomy desk a few times, and I haven't had asingle worry of it being unstable orincapable of holding my setup together.And that's because this desk can hold upto 355 lbs with ease. So, not only doesthis desk make my life easier, but italso keeps anything on it stable. Somemore things I want to briefly point outis the customization options, lettingyou choose from different sizes andcolors for both the tabletop and frame.Plus, if for some reason you end uphaving any issues, Flexispot is kindenough to provide a 15-year warranty forthe desk frame and a 2-year warranty forthe control panel and any electronics.The E6 desk has made my workflow so muchbetter, and I'm telling you, it is trulyworth the investment. So, if you've beenlooking for a desk that's going to lastyou, go ahead to that description andget you an E6 desk from Flexispot. Hugethank you again for sending this out.Now, let's get back to the video. Man,this is the desk pretty much installed.I don't have many of like the othercables from here yet. I just have theessentials, but it does the thing. Look,look, look, look. You press You pressdown. You pressdown. Oh man, this is going to be soconvenient when wanting to shift fromsitting down and then back to standingup for whatever I'm doing, school work,streaming, it don't matter. And it'ssuper dope to have one of these. So, bigthank you to Flexis Spot again. I'mgoing to set this up more tomorrow cuzit's midnight. I have class tomorrow.Overall, I'm just tired. My legs arehurting. I haven't like done this muchwork to my room or anything like that ina while. Guy like me needs some sleep.We're going to do more tomorrow.[Applause][Music]chat. Listen, we got a little something.New monitor just came in. 27 in 1440pIPS panel. I think ideally I just wantedsomething that had pretty good colorsfor gaming and editing. And I alsowanted a jump up from 24 cuz like a 27inmonitor for me that's kind of big.especially like always using 24 going to27. For me, that's a pretty good size todo any editing, any gaming, and I'm justexcited to put it together, not going tolie. Like I said, I want to get thissetup done as soon as possible. I wantto see the finished look. I want to showyou guys the finished look cuz we aregetting closer and closer. I put some ofthe peripherals on. I have the monitorback on. Now, we're going to add anotherone. So, let's do[Music]it. All[Music]right, I haven't filmed in a littlewhile, but this is the current state ofthe setup. monitors connected, workingwell, cable managed, and now it's likereally coming to life, especially, youknow, the keyboard connected, PC lightsall working well. We got some of the RGBbehind the desk, monitor, both monitors,actually. Camera mounted. Like, bro, wegot a we got a nice little setup here.Cable management's looking a lot betterthan it was this morning. There's stillsome basic stuff, but I have someextension cables on the way. I orderedthose with overnight. So, the setupshould be like fully fully cablemanaged, I should say, tomorrow. Ihaven't been filming much just cuz I'vebeen so busy building and managing thesetup and it's been kind of tiring ifI'm being honest. But we're at that homestretch. Everything that I've needed ishere besides like the extension cables Ijust mentioned. All like the bigpurchases I made. Everything is herenow. The dresser and nightstand came in.I think I'm going to set those uptomorrow. I bought the bed a couple daysago at IKEA or I picked it up. That Ineed to set up too. And then the ceilingfan I mentioned. I think I'm going totry and set that up now. If it's liketoo difficult, if I try and it's cooked,I'm going to just save that for tomorrowas well. This is going to look so goodwhen it's done. It's Look how Look howit looks already. It looks great.Hopefully the next time I pick thisthing up, the room and the setup is all[Music][Music]done. All[Music]right, the room is nearly finished.We've got almost everything installedand ready. I finished building thenightstand and the dresser. Everythingis completely cable managed. And we gotthe ceiling fan installed. I don't knowif you can fully see it, but it is upand running. It works great. It lookseven better. I said my bed would be thelast thing I put together. So beforethat, I have these motorized blinds thatI got sent out. And while I put thosetogether, I want to give a big big thankyou to Canesto. I'm a big fan ofblackout curtains, but unfortunately,most end up looking way too tacky, whichis where Cano comes in. They offer allsorts of shades, fabric colors, plusmeasurements to perfectly fit yourwindow. And like I said, these shadesare motorized. So with the press of abutton or by using your desired voiceassistant, you can be in full control.For me, I love using these to let insunlight in the mornings and blocksunlight when I want to sleep. Somethingelse to mention is that the motor isn'tjust smooth, but it's also pretty quietwhenoperating. So, if you want to make yourspace a little more fancy and mostimportantly functional, I'll haveKenos's website linked in thedescription of this video. Huge thanksagain, All[Music]right, it's been a little over a week,but this is the final room. This is howthe setup is looking. Everything is alldone and finished. I wanted to take sometime to just enjoy how the room turnedout. I also just wanted to use it with,you know, everyday tasks. You know, I'min college. I had a YouTube video toedit. I have other video work I'mworking on. Basically, I just wanted tomake sure that this whole space isactually functional and I've had noproblems. Everything works out well forme. This is super aesthetic. It's verysimilar to my last room, but at the sametime, it's really different. I think theshift away from the like RGB heavy stylewas definitely needed. I still havehints of it now, but you know, likethere's a right way to do it. It's notlike before everything was white and theonly like parts of life and pop were theRGB, but this time around I feel likeI've done a lot better. Let me know whatyou guys think down below. I don't evenknow what to say. Like I don't know whatelse I could ask for. I don't even wantto leave my room half the time anymore.And I feel like that says something. Soyeah. Again, let me know your thoughtsof the room and setup down in thecomments. Big thank you to all thecompanies who sent out products andhelped me make this whole projectpossible. And let me know if you guyswant an in-depth room tour. I'm not I'mnot doing that right now. I spent toomuch time filming and building. I'll dothat in another video. Let me know ifyou guys want to see that. Thank youguys for watching.","after 5 minutes of watching this video i was impressed by the editing music and look and scrolled down to see you only had 8 k, you deserve more champ keep going!!
a video of this quality from a creator of this size (respectfully) is absolutly insane. good shit mate
Honestly one of the best looking setups I have seen on youtube. A lot of them look very samey but this is much more unique and the vibes are immaculate.
I scrolled down from fullscreen, expecting to see someone with over 250k+ subscribers, and I see only 8k! Come on, keep on going lad, I wish you big!!!
I am reading the comments, and only a month ago, you had 8k subs. Now you have 11.2k! Sheesh - that's how you know this man put good work in and deserve the attention. You did great! Much Respect!
8:22 thats how you know he a genuine guy not just those rich people showing off their money , you deserve so much . Just Keep Learning and creating.
U are honestly so underrated! Definitely a new subscriber gained, almost 500k bro rooting for u! Ur gonna shine one day mark my words.. I thought u were on atleast 250k subs already. Keep on pushing!
Couple tips about painting one try to avoid sleeping in a freshly painted room. The fumes can be harmful to your health. If you absolutely have to sleep in a room that’s freshly painted. Make sure it’s well ventilated you can get a pretty gnarly headache from inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. Getting a paint job done in one day is almost always gonna look like shit long-term and not hold up doing at least two coats as recommended you had the right thought process on it
A renovated room feels oh soo good. Well made, especially the wooden accents. Wood makes everything better
When bro said not sponsored, I immediately wanted to buy that chair
cold setup bro 
i hope this vid gets way more views 
i bet it can get half a million easy
I love that wood paneling behind the desk going all the way to the shelf. I'll need to keep that in mind for the future lol.
Looks AMAZING DUDE !
Love your storytelling, bro. It's genuine, simple. It was a pure joy to see this video.
Holy, didnt expect the room to look this clean. I've been slowly building my room with a similar style as i wanted it to match my black Fractal design north case and your room is pretty much my end goal . Keep up the good work
I remember doing this for my room when I was getting my first gaming pc last year. I was suppose to only paint the corner of my room and then I ended up doing my whole room over and changing pretty much everything it was an amazing feeling when it came together.
I just revamped my room so this was pretty inspiring to add a couple more things in, loved it!
the pace of your storytelling is wonderful - not too slow to become boring but also not too fast to feel rush. I literally feel like Im actually living with you. You have a new subscriber here, thank you for making this vid
your video really motivates many people to re decor their rooms, as a full time college student and job, a side with streaming, i need to make my Room as Aesthetic as your room is now !
if i may give some more suggestions:
id recommend putting a curtain in front of your closet. it really blocks off the clutter plus i think a black curtain would look beautiful

i would personally also clean up the shelf above your setup a bit. there is a TON of stuff on it and the colors really clash agains the cozy vibe with your room. so if i were you id pick a few things i really like and put them on there, and the others somewhere else :D

overal, awesome video! i envy you!
The wood with the black was an AMAZING choice. I saw it before you even brought it up and went ""oooooooh thats gonna look good""
Love the look of your room! Just a message to myself and others that need it who are tight on funds…. I DO NOT NEED TO CONSUME!!! I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE AND IF I MANAGE TO HAVE EXTRA MONEY AFTER GETTING THINGS I NEED THEN MAYBE ILL CONSIDER TOYING AROUND WITH THE NOTION OF THINKING OF BUYING STUFF FOR MY SETUP!!!!
That xenohunter knife is sick man (also your room)
this was a crazy transformation, you look MAD different since the last time we interacting and i'm glad to see you slowly killing the tech game. KEEP THIS SHIT UP
The room came together so well. WE NEED MORE
Im moving out soon and have been looking for room inspo. This gave me a clear idea of what I want my room to look like. Thanks a lot man
!!
Great video!!! stumbled upon it in my feed
Personally am a white/green with wood accents type of guy but I dig your overall update!
Your next upgrade should be your air conditioner. the dual hose (intake and exhaust) versions are more efficient!
not gonna lie ... this turn out sick ... the way you turn this small room is so awesome... lot of love.
As many people are saying, the quality of this video and the editing are expected of a large channel! Keep at it, this was great!
Wait, this is so surreal seeing you walk out of that Home Depot. I live a few minutes from that Home Depot as well lmao. That's awesome seeing someone local doing this, super inspiring bro.
Loved the authenticity of this man. Most relatable thing I’ve watched in a long while and right on time when im about to make some changes to my space as well (: Never stop being you man your personality obviously resonates with a lot of us!
Love how dude just clipped his mic to his glasses
This video deserves a million views.
you deserve way more subs for the quality content you're uploading.

Much love from your home country!
I’m so close to getting my dream setup I’ve been saving for a while now and have about 200$ I need way more but these type of videos inspire to keep saving up you’ve gained a new subscriber
The beautiful background really suits the setup NICELY DONE MAN NGL
this video was very entertaining and motivation to renovate my room, I know that these videos take time and effort and seeing you do this looks amazing, subscribed and waiting for more fire videos, you deserve at least 10k, I believe you gonna make it there and further, good luck
Awesome video! Your room looks great! I will say my favorite thing are the wood panels. They look great!
don't remove the paper/seal on the PC with the PC on sometimes if its sealed to much it will cause static and maybe mess up ur pc for a bit but DW its ez to fix
man you deserve more subs, more views, more everything. You're a great youtuber and the fact you spent this much with only a small amount of subs has gotten you my respect.
How do you only have 11k man!?! Love the video and the whole design you went with, it's phenomenal! I eventually want to revamp my entire room and try and stream and make videos again!
first time watching you, and i have never ever stayed seated at my setup for that long just for a youtube video, keep it up man (great job with the editing)
Honestly, there isn't a lot of people make setup videos anymore and this was nice to see. Really great video and I'm definitely hitting that subscribe button. Keep up the great work!!! Sick setup!
this is amazing. You really did achieve a dream setup
Great Video! Loved the aesthetic. One small suggestion to get a black curtain to hide your closet + also keep dust and sunlight off your clothes.
I didn't expect this kind of quality from a channel with only 11k subs, great job bro keep it up!!
love the style you went for, amazing setup bro!
Loving the nice clean aesthetic of the room, and also the high end quality of the video itself. Seriously deserving of more attention. Keep up the great work man, you're doing an incredible job.
I'm yapping too much (12:30) is the most accurate statement ever!!
That wall with the black paint, the lights and the plant instantly improved the room, proper class! (Just needs to be not hidden by the bed! ) 2 mattresses though! I did that years ago and found it made my back worse! One of them was a cheapo one though, also do you notice much light coming through the canisteo window blinds? Look like they aren't flush to the sides if that makes sense?

Great set up BTW, room looks so much better after changing the decor!
It's always a treat finding Habesha YouTubers. Love ur vids gang
The breadknife to open the box at 20:04 was hilarious. Ill be using pencils to open my boxes XD
0:19 Not trying to be offensive or disrespectful, but low-key reminded me of Cookie from, ""Ned's Declassified. Which is an awesome character that brings charm to the group, which is my favorite when waiting for each episode.
room turned out dope!
love it dude! Im on my room revamping journey now as well. This helps a lot!
Boy 10/10 room bro you nailed it
this style IS the new ""rgb"" style
You just got another sub bro! Love the raw and genuine content.
setup looks crazyyy
I’m new to the channel and I can already tell you got potential. It was such a chill video I genuinely enjoyed it. And the end product Keep up the good work

Let's connect on any of my other socials for more theme park content, jelly cats and merch hunts!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/timeasmiles/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@timeasmiles\n\nBusiness Inquiries: timeasmiles@gmail.com\n","Here's my full office tour. It'sdefinitely not done. Very empty shelves,but I kind of wanted this to be abefore. And I've been getting a couplerequests on where I've gotten everythingfrom. I thought we would do that today.And then literally my PC parts come in afew days. And then next time you'll seeme, we'll probably be building the PCtogether, which oh, I'm so excited. I'vesaved for this PC for so long. I thoughtthis was so funny. So, I'm kind of Ithink I'm kind of starting to switchmore toward at home cozy lifestyle,gaming, reading, hobby stuff. I know Ihave been since January already on here.I think I'm starting to switch over onTik Tok and Instagram, too, which isreally exciting. But on here, we'llstill be doing all of the cozy stuff,but then we'll also be doing like littlevlogs. If I go out to theme parks or umhang out with friends, then you'll becoming along. I think I want to make myentire existence as cozy and stressfreeas physically possible because I do nothandle stress very well. What I thoughtwas really funny is when I still livedin my apartment 3 years ago and I wasbuilding my gaming setup, I initiallywanted to go with an all white verysterile gaming setup and I was going tostart like a gaming tech channel. So, ifI can find that footage where I didthat, I'll put that in here. So, you'llsee me from three years ago actuallyhaving filmed and edited this wholevideo and then chickened out and I neverposted it. So, I'll put that video inkind of toward the end just as like afun little bonus clip. But, let's getinto everything on my desk first andthen we'll kind of go around the room.So, my two monitors are the same. Theyare 27 in VS Sonic Elite gamingmonitors. The exact like model number ornumber that they have in the name isXG270Q. I don't know if they still sellthem. They're 165 Hz monitors. Then themonitor arm is actually from Amazon. Iwas gonna go with a really expensivearm, but I decided to get a cheaper armfirst because it had such good reviewsand I was like, well, the nice arm thatI really did want was like $300. It'samazing. It's actually amazing. It likemy monitors, they jiggle if I move mydesk, but like barely. If I'm just likewriting something on my desk, they don'tmove or anything. They keep their place.They have not fallen or like sagged atall yet. My current keyboard that I'musing is actually from Amazon as well.I'll try to have everything linked, bythe way, in case you want to getanything. But this current one fromAmazon that I have, I have not modded. Ididn't even change the key caps on thisone because frankly, it didn't need it.Like these, this keyboard is so heavyand so nice that it doesn't even needmodding, which is insane. The mouse thatI have is a Glorious mouse. I like thismouse a lot. It's very comfortable andvery light. The actual mouse pad thatI'm using, I actually got from Printull,I think it's called. I couldn't find acolor that I was thinking of in mousepads. I looked on Etsy. I looked onAmazon. I looked a bunch to at a bunchof places. I found a color that I reallyliked, just like a swatch, a colorswatch. I ended up going to Printull anduploading that color. And I put it onthis mouse pad and I ordered it and itcame and I love it. So that's a hack foryou. If you ever want a mouse pad, butyou can't find the one you like, justdesign it yourself and print it from aplace like Printull. I saw someone havethis phone stand charger and I fell inlove. And so I was like, ""Okay, I feellike I could 3D print that."" I took ascreenshot of it and then I did my best.I went into Solid Works and I designedit myself in Solid Works and then I gotthe filament and I 3D printed it on ourprinter. When I tell you it took so manytrial and errors to get the actualdesign and the 3D model correct, it wasit took so long. There was also a lot oftrial with like the weight and how andto make sure that it wouldn't like fallover or anything. This little light Igot from Amazon. I don't know if I wouldrecommend this light though. It's kindof eh I just have it on here foraesthetics, but I feel like there arebetter ones out there. It came with aremote, but it doesn't even reallychange colors very well. It doesn't haveany cute warm color options. So, I don'tknow if I would recommend that one, butjust in case you really need thatspecific one, I I have it. This clock Ifound at Five Below. I don't know how tolink that, so I don't think I will, butI'm sure you can find it anywhere. Andthen this fake plant I got from IKEA.And then the planter I got from HomeDepot. The Nintendo Switch, obviously,if you want to watch the video where Ibought the Nintendo Switch and unboxedit, that's in the previous video. Andthen the skins and the thumb grips Iactually got from a small businesscalled Sticky Tech. I love them. Andthen this mug that I use all the timehere cuz it just matches the fall vibeaesthetic, cozy aesthetic, uh, isactually from, I think, HomeGoods. Andthen the little coaster is from Etsy.The top of my desk is actually from theIKEA kitchen countertop section. Thenthe the drawers that it's sitting on arethe Alex drawers. And then I have thispegboard that I still need to put up onmy wall, also from IKEA. And then thelittle things on the pegboard that areholding up my flashlight and myheadphones, my boyfriend designed and 3Dprinted them. Then behind me are thesebeautiful shelves that I just got andthey're from Target. I've been eyeingthem for so long. I actually consideredgetting them as a bookcase before I hadbought my actual bookcase, but they werenever on sale and they're like $400. Icaught them on sale. They were like over$100 off. I had to get them immediately,so I snatched them. The light on it,this round light is from IKEA. And thenthis other light is also from IKEA. Andthen all the rest of the ambiancelighting that's stuck to like mymonitors, the back of my desk, that'sall go lighting. And then behind methere's also a fake olive tree andthat's also from Amazon. And then behindthat is a Goi corner lamp also fromAmazon. Okay, so now plans for theoffice, right? So I already have it inmy Etsy cart. I just need to order it. Ihave some pictures that I want to put atthe top. And then I just need a bunchmore knickknacks. So, if there are anylike small businesses that you thinksell really cute knickknacks or placesthat I should go or think places I couldfind little tiny things to decorate myshelves. And then obviously I want toput stuff on the walls like if I'm goingto be filming at this angle, I needsomething like over here. And I'mthinking maybe like another poster.Yeah, I'm thinking like a picture oranother poster or a neon sign orsomething fun up there. And then up hereI'm going to put my pegboard. And then Iwant to do little lights. I also want toput up some more like I want to put up aton of stuff. I'm also consideringputting back my curtains from before,but all my desk is already here and I'dhave to move everything. So, I'm notsure if I really want to do that or if Ijust want to leave it. Honestly, that'sit. That's my entire office. Let me showyou my library. Okay, I need a secondbookcase like immediately. IKEA has beensold out of this style of bookcase. So,this is the very basic IKEA bookcase,and I need a second one cuz I have somemore books coming in. This rug is fromAmazon. This reading chair is fromAnthropology. The blanket is fromTarget. And then the pillows came withthe chair, but the covers are fromAmazon. The light is also from Amazon,but the bulb in it is from Goi. Themirror my friend was moving and shedidn't need it anymore, so she gave itto me. And then I have all of theseframes and all of these prints that Istill need to buy. Making a wholegallery wall on this wall. I justactually have to press buy on my Etsycart cuz they're all in there. All theprints are in there. Some of them aredigital. Some of them are actual prints.I just need to actually buy it and Ineed to pull the trigger. And I thinkall the prints that I need for thisoffice and for the ones in my libraryare like$170 total. Again, some digital, somenot. I know that's probably not thatmuch. It's kind of a lot at the sametime. So, I'm waiting till I get paidagain. Next payday, I'm getting it.We'll do an updated one where we'll havethe gallery wall. If you're watchingthis and you are looking for inspo,you're looking to kind of get yourgaming setup going, just know that thiswas not an overnight thing. Like, did Igo on shopping rampages every once in awhile and get like three things at once?Sure, it's okay for your office to notbe aesthetic. the amount of cables thatare just around my desk right nowbecause I have to use this complicateddocking system and I have to use my oldcomputer that's literally about toexplode every time I turn it on until Ihave my PC which I've been saving my formy PC for a long time and I've toldmyself that once I get my PC I'll get mycable management in order and like untilthen it's just been cables everywhereugly ugly ugly cables that's okay It'sokay to not have the absolute perfectmost aesthetic setup. Anyway, withoutfurther ado, let's watch the first evertech video that I made and then neverposted[Music]it. Welcome to Tim Tech. I'm Tim and I'mgoing to be building my very firstsetup.I want fast refresh rate for when I dostart gaming like on a PC. Um cuz rightnow I just game on like my PlayStation.I also wanted good color grading. If youhave done any research about monitors,you'll basically know that everyonetells you you can't do both. You can'thave high refresh rate and have goodcolor grading. But I found this one. Ithink it came out like around 2 yearsago. Um but this one basically has agood balance of everything. One littletab. Two little tabs.Oh, BRB. I'm going to flip this over.Here's what the inside of the box lookslike. Everything's a mess. So, let's goahead and start taking everything outpiece by piece. Okay, first piece ofpaper. We've got clips and aninstruction manual, I think. All right.Next, we've got a cable. This looks likethe power cable. Nope, just kidding.Wow, I'm blind. This is the display portcable. And this came likethis. Okay, so this is the monitormount. All right. Okay. Yeah. And themonitor mount is made out of aluminum.It's really nice, actually. I kind oflike it. It's really sleek looking and Ilike that it's aluminum. It just makesit feel more expensive, I guess. Andthen this is what's going to be mountedto the actual monitor. It's got theplate and it's just standard sizing. Andthen this actually they have a grip atthe top so you can carry the monitor.But even the mount is reallyheavy. So now I'm scared how heavy themonitor is. I'm going to set up themount first. This bottom part is goingto go into here with there's like ascrew that's like an easy twisty turnwith like a little handle onit. I'm just going to put thatin.Okay. Done. Okay. So, now let's take outthe monitor.Wow, dirty. Here's what the back lookslike. Here's one. I can't turn this onyet because I need the docking stationthat connects to my Mac. Okay, so someof these have little latchy things orarms so that you can hang your uhheadphones. And then there are alsothese little clips at the bottom to holdyour mouse's uh wire. There's also umRGB lighting on the back, which I didn'treally care about, but it's there.There's kind of a cable managementlittle circle right there. And thenthere is also RGB lighting. I heard andseen in reviews that it's not superstrong, but it gets like a floody glow.So, we can test that out. Let's open upthe keyboard. So, as I mentionedearlier, this keyboard is fromMechanical Keyboards. It's a Ducky 13,and I ended up getting the Cherry MX uhclear switches. I do want to end upmodding it to be with the Boba U4switches, tactile switches, but alsoagain, that's more money. So, I'm kindof splitting things up like every coupleweeks. So, that'll come in the future.And possibly new key caps,too.Here is the box for the duckykeyboard.Wow. And then here is the keyboard.Okay. So, it comes with the key cappullers. It comes with little switchpullers. It comes with a braided cable.That's nice. I like that it's braided.It comes with a white space bar becauseI think the space bar on here is like auh printed one that they put on. Andthen it comes with some extra key caps,some purple key caps. That's cool. Iknow that if you get a colored one, theygive you a little um a couple differentvariations of colors you can choose fromfor your keyboard. Oh, yes. It'sbeautiful. Wow. It's actually a lotheavier than I thought for being plastickeyboard. It also has like these chromeor silver sides, which I think would gonice like if I end up getting otheraccessories that are white based.Normally, they'll pair them with achrome or like silver accenting. Andthen it has this like tiger space bar onit. And then one of the purple key caps.All right, let's go set this up on mydesk. Okay, so this is what I'mcurrently working with. This Alex deskis what I have from IKEA. And then Inormally have a second table right hereto make like an Lshaped desk, which iswhat all the monitors and keyboard arestanding on right now. So, I'm justgoing to wipe this off and then we'regoing to put everything onit. Well, I would like this ideally bein the center. My boyfriend's printer istaking up real estate on my desk. Okay,give me a second. Let me Let me figurethis out. Okay, here's how it looksright now. Basically, this is the entirelength of mydesk. Everything will eventually bewhite. Also, don't this is not going tobe a satisfying build my setup cablemanagement. Everything is perfect. Thisis going to be a step-by-step process.I'm going to plug everything in and thensee how the lights look, see howeverything looks, and I will show youguys how that looks. And then we're justgoing to kind of chill here and waituntil more stuff comes. So, I do reallylove this purple, though. I'm not goingto lie. But I want it all white. So,let's change the key cap really quick.It always givesme anxiety to take these out cuz I'mscared I'm going to breakit. Should we do a sound test, guys?Okay. I don't have a separate mic, sothis is as close as I can get while alsofilming.So, they're pretty clacky and clicky,and I like more of a silent or likethick sounding key. So, I do like theactuation force on these a lot. And Iand I I think I like heavy keys, but Ialso heard that if you're gaming, likeyour fingers can get tired a lot fasterbecause it obviously requires a lot moreforce. Again, this coloring literallybothers me so much, but this uh patternis cool. Okay, here is mylaptop. Currently has like a white vinylon it. Ignore how dirty it is. I thoughtwe could connect the keyboard at leastto my laptop and see how that goes. Thecable even has a little cover. That'scute. Oh, that sound wassatisfying.Wow. Well, it looks pretty cool. I'm notgoing to lie. Your keyboard cannot beidentified and will not be usable untilit is identified. Press the keyimmediately to the right of the shiftkey. Press the key immediately to theleft of the shiftkey. Your keyboard has been identified.Click done to start using your computer.If this isn't the correct type for yourkeyboard, select type and click done.United States. It's United States. Okay.So, let's go into likeWord. I will never use my work laptopkeyboard again. It works.But now, how do I change the colors?Okay, the frame rate is off slightly, sothat's why it looks like it'sflickering, but this is like breathingmode. I I chose this color, by the way.Um, then there's like just stagnant. So,again, it's like flickering because theframe rates are off um on the camera andthen on the lights. And then there islike a swirl one. There's this one goesoutward.Then there's a like RGBone. Then there's this one that justkind of also switches through thedifferentcolors. This one I think just goes onrandom colors like just picks randomkeys like awave. And then this one is kind of cool.So whatever you type like, ""Hi, my nameis Tim.""It like illuminates those keys for likea little bit and then it does the samething but with onecolor. Okay. I had to spin the monitoraround to reach theport. Okie dokie. Artich chokey. We'renot doing any cable management, so Idon't even want to hear it. Okay. Wow,it works. And look, you can see the RGBunderneath. That is actually prettybright. Yeah, it is. So to have both ortwo monitors connected to a MacBookthrough a docking station, you need todownload driver for it. So let's I'mgoing to test the other monitor and thenthat'll probably be it for today. If allgoes well, you won't hear from me untilthe docking station comes in. And then Ialso the goal is to kind of get a littlePC mount underneath the desk. And I alsowant to obviously get white cables. Iwant to cable manage. And then obviouslylike I'm saying just like slowly startgetting accessories to make it a fullstation. So for now that's going to beit. That's going to be the mostimportant things aside from a PC for mystation. So I'll see you whenever thedocking station comes in. Anyway, that'sit. That's all I wanted to say. Um andthat's my little office setup. I can'twait to look back at this video and seehow much farther I've progressed in afew months, in the next year, two years,whatever. I can't wait to look back onthis. Stay tuned for the PC building.Stay tuned for streaming cozy games andif you want to follow along on like lifestuff that this is where to do that cuzon Tik Tok doing more curated videos,but on here it's going to be more chillvibbey lifey stuff. So, thank you so somuch for watching. I love you. Bye.[Music][Music]","Animal crossing in this room would be amazing!

I have a tiny microphone. Aboutexactly a year ago today, I made a videowhere I built my dream setup. In thatvideo, I took you guys along as I wentthrough my inspiration for decor, builtmy own PC from scratch, which I stillcan't believe I did. I thought it wouldbe fun to make a video giving you alittle tour of all the things that Ihave changed and improved after a yearand also just letting you see all of thethings that I keep in my setup to makesure that it's as cozy as possible aswell as functional. As someone who ispart of the Nosy community, I loveseeing what people keep on their desksand it gives me inspiration and waysthat I can improve my own. So, I thoughtit'd be fun to make one of my own incase you would like to see that as well.Without further ado, let me show you mycozy gaming and workingand everything[Music]setup. Welcome to my cozy setup. As youcan see, I'm really into warm, neutralcolors. I love wood. I love browns. Ialso love a pop of green here and there.So, more than anything, what I strivefor is to make this space as calming andsimple as possible while also being cuteand functional, a place where I canfocus, if you know what I mean. Thefirst thing I wanted to talk about is myAsus monitors. When I was investing inmy setup, my monitors was the part thatI kind of didn't really invest on. Ijust wanted to get something that wasfunctional and inexpensive. And I was alittle nervous that I was maybe makingthe wrong choice by doing that. Buthonestly, I have no issue with these.These are great quality. They workperfectly. No complaints therewhatsoever. I also got this monitor racethat I got from Amazon. For a while, Ididn't quite understand the purpose of amonitor race other than aesthetic andmaking your desk look more put together.And though I do feel like it does that,I really love the way that it looks.I've also learned how much it has helpedmy posture, especially if you'respending a lot of time on your desk.Having your monitors higher and eye viewrather than having to look down to lookat them is good for your push pure. I'mreally a big fan of it. I really lovethat I can put stuff under it as well.It helps keep my desk a little bit tidy.A new addition to my desk is thiscamera. I love this camera so much. Iused to have a Logitech camera and thatone is still really good. But this oneis incredible. It has a really quickautofocus feature which is very helpfulespecially for a stream or if you'rehaving a Zoom call and you need to showsomething on the camera. Also, thequality is just insane. So, I'm going tomake sure to link everything in thedescription. And if I have any affiliatecodes for anything, I'll make sure tolink those as well for you in case youguys are interested in saving a littlebit of money and also helping out mychannel. One of my bigger additions thatI did to my setup was actually thesespeakers. I kind of didn't realize thatcomputers, especially when you buildthem yourself, don't come with their ownspeakers. So I was a little bit confusedabout that. So I realized I had to buymyself some speakers separately. I didthat sometime in the middle of last yearand I have found that to be very veryvery helpful. Has made my setup just alot more comfortable because sometimesyou just don't want to have yourheadphones in want to play music or evenplay a video while you're doingsomething else. It's easier not to belike tethered to your desk all the time.A newer addition as well. that you guyswould have seen me in one of my vlogs. Idon't remember which one, but I willlink that somewhere. But I did add thiscute shelf on top of my desk. I reallylove it. I tried to find something thatwas the same wood grain as my desk. Thisdesk is from IKEA, by the way. It's alittle bit wobbly, but it gets the jobdone, and it's really big. It gets thejob done. I can't stop thinking aboutthat song when I say that. Anyway, Itried to find something that was thesame wood grain as my desk. And alsosomething that was almost as long as mydesk as well, cuz a lot of the shelvesthat I could find were like really tiny.I wanted something that went all the wayalong. I also didn't want to have liketwo shelves. I thought it would justlook more sleek if I had just one, youknow? That's that. I really love it.Even though it's a nice accent point, itdoesn't come out too too much onto mydesk. So, it's more decorative than itis functional, I would say. But that'swhat I wanted it for, so I'm I'm reallyhappy with it. The stuff that I put onmy shelf changes periodically. I'm thekind of person who really lovesswitching things around when it comes tomy decor in general for the seasons, butalso sometimes I get a little bored ofhaving things looking the same for areally long period of time. So, you willnotice this changing a lot throughout myvideos. But right now, I'm really happywith how simple it looks. Maybe I shouldhave something here in the middle, but Ijust haven't had the time to figure thatout. I have a cute little candle. I havemy lavender DS that I got recently formy birthday, and I love it so much I hadto display it. I love the color of it.That's on a little controller stand.Doesn't fit all the way. It's kind oflike crooked, but it gets the job done.I also put this plant here, which I amso so pleased with. It was really,really tiny when I first moved and nowit's gotten so long and beautiful andluscious and I'm really really proud ofthat. In the plant, I do have a littlesmithy. I also got this guy. Oh my god,this guy I got as a Christmas gift. It'sone of those frogs. I don't know ifyou've seen those videos on Instagram,but he is just the most beautiful thingI've ever seen. This is from an Etsyartist. So, I will try and find them andlink that Etsy artist in the descriptionas well if you want to get one of those.They have different kinds with differentoutfits and they're just so freakingcute. Then, we come to the area of mydesk that I feel has changed the mostsince I did my building my dream setupvideo. I've added a lot of fun stuff onthis side that I really, really lovelooking at. The first thing being thispegboard. I am so, so happy with it. Imostly got it to be able to display mykeyboards, and that's what I've beenusing it for. My keyboard collection hasbeen growing, which I'll talk about in alittle bit, but I'm really happy to havea place where I can display them safelyand make them like a feature of my setuprather than putting them in a closet,you know, because they're so pretty. Ihave my Pro controller down here and myNintendo Switch, which looks exactly thesame as it always has. Another newaddition is this beautiful pixel artdisplay that I got sent by D Voom acouple of months ago. And I love that itis functional while at the same timejust being really pretty cuz you can setit up to so many things to help you, butalso there are so many beautiful artthat you can find. I especially love thevideo game ones. They have some Zeldaones that are just incredible. I alsohave a lot of little guys on theshelves. I have this chicken that I goton a trip that I did with friends. Youwill also notice that there's a frogtheme kind of going on. I love frogs andI have a lot of friends who know thatabout me, so they keep giving me frogstuff and it makes my heart so happy.Recently, one of my good friends andviewers gave me this tiny frogknickknack, and I keep it here. Andanother one of my really, really goodfriends gave me this coaster based onone of the emotes in our Discord, and Ilove it so much. I know it's a coaster,but I feel like it's too cute to use itas a coaster. So, I just have itdisplayed here. I also did anothercollaboration with Doom, and they sentme this fast charger. I love it. It's soadorable. It has a pixel display on itas well and it works incredible. So, Ikeep it here on my desk because it comesin so handy whenever I need to chargeliterally anything. I also still have mymushroom lamp. This lamp has beenthrough every single stage of my setup.It still works perfectly. I've had itfor I think at least 3 years. It's socute. It's so perfect. I feel like it'llalways be in my setup in some way. Ialso have this really cool fine finemicrophone. And this has been one of themost anticipated upgrades that I had formy setup. I used to have a really wonkyAmazon mic for the longest time. I knewthat for the quality of my streams, Iwanted to have a better mic. And so, Ihave this fine fine mic. And I reallylove that it has this arm cuz when I'mnot using it for stream or for calls orwhatever, I canjust ta and then it's out of the way.And I love that I still have my samefine fine headphones that I've alwayshad. Hold Pache is using the bathroom.It's like she knows I'm recording andthen she's like, ""Oh, it's time guys.It's time."" But I did want to point outthis headphone clips. They are made by asmall business. I get so many questionsabout them. I will link the businessbelow. And I think one of the mainreasons why my headphones have lasted somuch, it'sthis guy right here. When I got it forthe first time, I was like, is thissomething that I'm really going to usefor a very long time? Like, maybe it'slike a novelty thing and then I won'tuse it anymore. I use it every singleday. So, in case you were thinking ifheadphone stands are even functional, myreview is yes, they really, really are.And I feel like they are one of thereasons why headphones have stayed insuch good shape. Let's talk aboutkeyboards for a moment, shall we? Sorryabout the weird lighting here. As youcan see, I have two very similarkeyboards here on my little display. I'mgoing to give you my reviewish of thesestyles of keyboards. I feel like theseare very popular in the cozy gamingcommunity because they are veryaffordable and really cute. You can getthem off of Amazon and stuff. I will saythough, these keyboards are not the bestquality. If you're trying to find a goodclacky keyboard and you're also someonewho spends a lot of time working in yourcomputer, all of my tech goes throughthe ringer with me because I use it soso much. It might just be a me thing,but these ones have not lasted reallywell for me. Green one just stoppedworking one day. And then this one isokay. Like sometimes some of the keyskind of stick and I have to like reallygo at it to like make it work. Myback. I'm so old. Jesus. I still usethis one because it still works and Ireally love the way that it looks. Butif you're looking to invest on akeyboard, I would say don't get these.You can pay a tin like 20 bucks more andget something that's a little bit betterquality that sounds better and wouldlast you a bit longer. That's what Ithink. And while we're here, I alsowanted to say that one of oneimprovement that I want to do, anotherimprovement thatI just throwing things on the ground.One thing that I want to improve aboutmy desk is actually I want to getanother one of these pegboard thingiesto put right on top of here. I feel likeit'll elongate the desk, but then alsomy keyboard collection has been growing,so I need more space to put them onhere. Another thing that I improved onmy desk is I got a stream deck. I'mactually really grateful because I hadthat on my throne for my birthday.People in the community actually helpedme crowdfund this. So, thank you guys. Ireally appreciate you. This has changedthe game for streaming and it's made itso much easier for me and made meimprove streaming just in general. So,I'm really happy about that. Still liketo keep my iPad back here becausesometimes I have stuff to do in my iPad.I actually recently started drawing myown emotes. So, I've been doing that forthe last couple days and I need my iPadfor that. So, I've been using that. Anddown here, this is this has been a lifechanger for me. I got this at thebeginning of the year. This is a weeklyplanner. I just write down all thethings that I have to do. Keeps meorganized. It looks really nice andsimple and pretty. And yeah, I alsorecently got this mouse pad. I love theshape. I love the color. It's easy toclean and it's there. This is also themouse that came with this keyboard here.It's simple and it's there and it worksso I use it. I recently got thiskeyboard because I'm actually doing acollaboration with a keycap companywhich that video might be out by thetime this is out. So, I will maybe linkit if it's out. I'm really reallyexcited for that. It's like the perfectmatch made in heaven. So, I cannot waitfor you guys to see that. All right,what else do we have? We have mybeautiful and amazing andincredible computer. Incredible.Amazing. Showstoppping. This is thecomputer that I built last year. I mean,there's really not much I can say aboutit. It's a 10 out of 10. I still reallylove it. Patcha also loves it. What doyou think? It's working perfectly. Itstill looks beautiful. It's easy toclean. And yeah, I really have nocomplaints. A new thing that startedhappening after I moved actually was Istarted a silly little magnetcollection. Most of these are magnetsthat have been given to me. So, I justreally love it. It's a really cutelittle way that you can customize yourcomputer and it's just fun to collectstuff. I have this monkey jungle onefrom a place here in Florida, which ifyou live in Miami and you haven't beento Monkey Jungle, you have to. It'sreally It's a really great place. Irecommend especially if you like feedingcute monkeys. I have these egg ones andthis little blob one that were a gift.This snail one was also a gift from aloved one. This frog one was a gift fromNick. If you're watching, I love you.Thank you. This one was a gift from mybrother. And then I have this one thatlooks like Patcha. My legs are hurtingfrom sitting here. Anyway, a new thingthat I did get recently because of someof my comments in that video where Ibuilt this PC, people were telling menot to put it directly on the groundbecause it would get a lot of dustunderneath. So, I actually got thislittle platform to be able to move itaround and clean itbetter. God, that's been really reallyhelpful to move it around for whateverreason. This guy is really, really heavyand I'm always really apprehensive aboutcarrying it and moving it around becauseI'm afraid that I'm going to drop it orsomething. I'm very clumsy. Okay, if youhave your PC directly on the ground,maybe consider getting one of those cuzit's a game changer for me. Hello. Hi.I'm I'm still here. I'm just out offrame. Okay. I feel like in thesestores, people don't really talk aboutthis. The way that they organize theirstuff on their drawers, and I'm kind ofnosy about that. I don't know about you.So, I'm going to show you how I organizethings in my drawers really quick. Okay,in this drawer, this is like the drawer.Oh, there's hair. This where I keep myhair. This is the drawer where I keepall of the things that I need to accesson a dayto-day basis. I have someheadphones. I have my glasses, stuff toremove key caps and clean them, pens,all that good stuff. Erasers, stickers,very, very helpful. I have a wholedrawer filled with fidget toys. I amvery, very neurode divergent and I likefidget toys for that reason. They reallyhelp me focus some days. They help me onstream, all that good stuff. I also havethis random brain cell plushy which ifyou know you know I guess from mystreams. And then back here I have awhole stack of my planners and notebooksthat I use on a day-to-day basis to keepme organized. All of that good stuff.Down here I literally have a wholedrawer of cozy crafting. I mean I have alot more cozy crafting stuff but theseare the things that I reach for on aregular basis. And it's mostly just mycoloring books. I have a lot of them.The Heartstoppper coloring book. It's socute. I have my Hoohoohoo markers andyeah, just like random things that Imight need like measuring tape and stufffor writing letters and stuff like that.Down here, I have some miscellaneousstuff. As you can see, this is mostlyjust where I like to keep my laptop cuzI like for it to have a nice organizedplace for it to be in. And I also havelike a random lighter, my Bluetoothheadphones, and atripod. And then down here, I just haveall of the things that I use for filmingpretty much. I have like an extrawebcam. I have a light. This is where Ikeep my camera when not I'm notrecording, batteries, chargers, SDcards, wires, all of that really fun,not very aesthetic stuff. The last thingI would like to show you is this chair.I did not buy this chair. This was agift from my brother. He had an extrachair and he was like, ""Do you want it?""And I said, ""Yes."" I really love it.It's an extra large, which is a bit bigfor me, but it ends up working out cuz Ican like cross my legs on it and sitlike a gremling as I always do when I'mediting. I still have the same blanketthat I got in my building my dream setupvideo. I think that's it. I also have areally cute cat that sometimes likes tohang out over here. What do you have tosay foryourself? Exactly. All righty. Back tome. When I made that video last year, Ithere were a lot of things that I stillwanted to improve on. And some of thethings I have, some of those things Ihaven't. I feel like a gaming setup is aplace that just naturally improves overtime. This is my happy place. This iswhere I spent most of my time in.Whether it is working, filming, editing,streaming, playing games with myfriends. I hope you like this tour. Letme know what you thought of this video.I would love to hear your thoughts inthe comments. If you like this video,remember to give it a like andsubscribe. But most importantly,remember to take care of yourself. Havesome rest, have some water, and I'll seeyou in the next video. Bye.[Music]","A proud member of the nosey community

awesome bro .inspiring
W vid, your channel is about to blow up
random recommendation. very nice!
Hey man, saw you on Ed's setup wars. I'm filipino myself, and I wanted to ask what docking station you have. Specifically the one under your desk where you connect your HDMI, ethernet, etc. We have the same kind of laptop but mine is only the ideapad and it doesn't support thunderbolt c Not sure with the LOQ. It needs a separate display link adapter to make a third extra monitor work. Kasi used na rin ang HDMI ko. Sobrang solid ng setup bro! Hoping to get the same feel.
This guy loves Emilia-
hehehe...salamat may napili na rin ako sa mga item mo...
hello sir wow ganda ng home set-up mo sa pc mo...i like the table tsaka kung saan nakalagay yung mga alaga mong laruan
susundan ko ito
Deserve more followers
Maybe Your laptop is Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 not Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 because the left side of the Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 Laptop has absolutely no connection port
i like the best waifus corner
Nice setup, does the xiaomi g pro 27i has give you any kind of problem in daily use due to flickering? Im Planning to buy it and I literallly use the pc al most all day
boss may link ka nung table mo sa kanan? yung pinatungan ng mario and minion? :)
I'm getting goon cave vibes
How did you get the light bar on the monitor? I have the same ones and they just do not fit in
LOQ or LEGION? it can handle 2 tb m.2?
Change the position of your laptop, it doesn't align with the height of the monitor. OCD iykyk!!

I have a tiny microphone. Aboutexactly a year ago today, I made a videowhere I built my dream setup. In thatvideo, I took you guys along as I wentthrough my inspiration for decor, builtmy own PC from scratch, which I stillcan't believe I did. I thought it wouldbe fun to make a video giving you alittle tour of all the things that Ihave changed and improved after a yearand also just letting you see all of thethings that I keep in my setup to makesure that it's as cozy as possible aswell as functional. As someone who ispart of the Nosy community, I loveseeing what people keep on their desksand it gives me inspiration and waysthat I can improve my own. So, I thoughtit'd be fun to make one of my own incase you would like to see that as well.Without further ado, let me show you mycozy gaming and workingand everything[Music]setup. Welcome to my cozy setup. As youcan see, I'm really into warm, neutralcolors. I love wood. I love browns. Ialso love a pop of green here and there.So, more than anything, what I strivefor is to make this space as calming andsimple as possible while also being cuteand functional, a place where I canfocus, if you know what I mean. Thefirst thing I wanted to talk about is myAsus monitors. When I was investing inmy setup, my monitors was the part thatI kind of didn't really invest on. Ijust wanted to get something that wasfunctional and inexpensive. And I was alittle nervous that I was maybe makingthe wrong choice by doing that. Buthonestly, I have no issue with these.These are great quality. They workperfectly. No complaints therewhatsoever. I also got this monitor racethat I got from Amazon. For a while, Ididn't quite understand the purpose of amonitor race other than aesthetic andmaking your desk look more put together.And though I do feel like it does that,I really love the way that it looks.I've also learned how much it has helpedmy posture, especially if you'respending a lot of time on your desk.Having your monitors higher and eye viewrather than having to look down to lookat them is good for your push pure. I'mreally a big fan of it. I really lovethat I can put stuff under it as well.It helps keep my desk a little bit tidy.A new addition to my desk is thiscamera. I love this camera so much. Iused to have a Logitech camera and thatone is still really good. But this oneis incredible. It has a really quickautofocus feature which is very helpfulespecially for a stream or if you'rehaving a Zoom call and you need to showsomething on the camera. Also, thequality is just insane. So, I'm going tomake sure to link everything in thedescription. And if I have any affiliatecodes for anything, I'll make sure tolink those as well for you in case youguys are interested in saving a littlebit of money and also helping out mychannel. One of my bigger additions thatI did to my setup was actually thesespeakers. I kind of didn't realize thatcomputers, especially when you buildthem yourself, don't come with their ownspeakers. So I was a little bit confusedabout that. So I realized I had to buymyself some speakers separately. I didthat sometime in the middle of last yearand I have found that to be very veryvery helpful. Has made my setup just alot more comfortable because sometimesyou just don't want to have yourheadphones in want to play music or evenplay a video while you're doingsomething else. It's easier not to belike tethered to your desk all the time.A newer addition as well. that you guyswould have seen me in one of my vlogs. Idon't remember which one, but I willlink that somewhere. But I did add thiscute shelf on top of my desk. I reallylove it. I tried to find something thatwas the same wood grain as my desk. Thisdesk is from IKEA, by the way. It's alittle bit wobbly, but it gets the jobdone, and it's really big. It gets thejob done. I can't stop thinking aboutthat song when I say that. Anyway, Itried to find something that was thesame wood grain as my desk. And alsosomething that was almost as long as mydesk as well, cuz a lot of the shelvesthat I could find were like really tiny.I wanted something that went all the wayalong. I also didn't want to have liketwo shelves. I thought it would justlook more sleek if I had just one, youknow? That's that. I really love it.Even though it's a nice accent point, itdoesn't come out too too much onto mydesk. So, it's more decorative than itis functional, I would say. But that'swhat I wanted it for, so I'm I'm reallyhappy with it. The stuff that I put onmy shelf changes periodically. I'm thekind of person who really lovesswitching things around when it comes tomy decor in general for the seasons, butalso sometimes I get a little bored ofhaving things looking the same for areally long period of time. So, you willnotice this changing a lot throughout myvideos. But right now, I'm really happywith how simple it looks. Maybe I shouldhave something here in the middle, but Ijust haven't had the time to figure thatout. I have a cute little candle. I havemy lavender DS that I got recently formy birthday, and I love it so much I hadto display it. I love the color of it.That's on a little controller stand.Doesn't fit all the way. It's kind oflike crooked, but it gets the job done.I also put this plant here, which I amso so pleased with. It was really,really tiny when I first moved and nowit's gotten so long and beautiful andluscious and I'm really really proud ofthat. In the plant, I do have a littlesmithy. I also got this guy. Oh my god,this guy I got as a Christmas gift. It'sone of those frogs. I don't know ifyou've seen those videos on Instagram,but he is just the most beautiful thingI've ever seen. This is from an Etsyartist. So, I will try and find them andlink that Etsy artist in the descriptionas well if you want to get one of those.They have different kinds with differentoutfits and they're just so freakingcute. Then, we come to the area of mydesk that I feel has changed the mostsince I did my building my dream setupvideo. I've added a lot of fun stuff onthis side that I really, really lovelooking at. The first thing being thispegboard. I am so, so happy with it. Imostly got it to be able to display mykeyboards, and that's what I've beenusing it for. My keyboard collection hasbeen growing, which I'll talk about in alittle bit, but I'm really happy to havea place where I can display them safelyand make them like a feature of my setuprather than putting them in a closet,you know, because they're so pretty. Ihave my Pro controller down here and myNintendo Switch, which looks exactly thesame as it always has. Another newaddition is this beautiful pixel artdisplay that I got sent by D Voom acouple of months ago. And I love that itis functional while at the same timejust being really pretty cuz you can setit up to so many things to help you, butalso there are so many beautiful artthat you can find. I especially love thevideo game ones. They have some Zeldaones that are just incredible. I alsohave a lot of little guys on theshelves. I have this chicken that I goton a trip that I did with friends. Youwill also notice that there's a frogtheme kind of going on. I love frogs andI have a lot of friends who know thatabout me, so they keep giving me frogstuff and it makes my heart so happy.Recently, one of my good friends andviewers gave me this tiny frogknickknack, and I keep it here. Andanother one of my really, really goodfriends gave me this coaster based onone of the emotes in our Discord, and Ilove it so much. I know it's a coaster,but I feel like it's too cute to use itas a coaster. So, I just have itdisplayed here. I also did anothercollaboration with Doom, and they sentme this fast charger. I love it. It's soadorable. It has a pixel display on itas well and it works incredible. So, Ikeep it here on my desk because it comesin so handy whenever I need to chargeliterally anything. I also still have mymushroom lamp. This lamp has beenthrough every single stage of my setup.It still works perfectly. I've had itfor I think at least 3 years. It's socute. It's so perfect. I feel like it'llalways be in my setup in some way. Ialso have this really cool fine finemicrophone. And this has been one of themost anticipated upgrades that I had formy setup. I used to have a really wonkyAmazon mic for the longest time. I knewthat for the quality of my streams, Iwanted to have a better mic. And so, Ihave this fine fine mic. And I reallylove that it has this arm cuz when I'mnot using it for stream or for calls orwhatever, I canjust ta and then it's out of the way.And I love that I still have my samefine fine headphones that I've alwayshad. Hold Pache is using the bathroom.It's like she knows I'm recording andthen she's like, ""Oh, it's time guys.It's time."" But I did want to point outthis headphone clips. They are made by asmall business. I get so many questionsabout them. I will link the businessbelow. And I think one of the mainreasons why my headphones have lasted somuch, it'sthis guy right here. When I got it forthe first time, I was like, is thissomething that I'm really going to usefor a very long time? Like, maybe it'slike a novelty thing and then I won'tuse it anymore. I use it every singleday. So, in case you were thinking ifheadphone stands are even functional, myreview is yes, they really, really are.And I feel like they are one of thereasons why headphones have stayed insuch good shape. Let's talk aboutkeyboards for a moment, shall we? Sorryabout the weird lighting here. As youcan see, I have two very similarkeyboards here on my little display. I'mgoing to give you my reviewish of thesestyles of keyboards. I feel like theseare very popular in the cozy gamingcommunity because they are veryaffordable and really cute. You can getthem off of Amazon and stuff. I will saythough, these keyboards are not the bestquality. If you're trying to find a goodclacky keyboard and you're also someonewho spends a lot of time working in yourcomputer, all of my tech goes throughthe ringer with me because I use it soso much. It might just be a me thing,but these ones have not lasted reallywell for me. Green one just stoppedworking one day. And then this one isokay. Like sometimes some of the keyskind of stick and I have to like reallygo at it to like make it work. Myback. I'm so old. Jesus. I still usethis one because it still works and Ireally love the way that it looks. Butif you're looking to invest on akeyboard, I would say don't get these.You can pay a tin like 20 bucks more andget something that's a little bit betterquality that sounds better and wouldlast you a bit longer. That's what Ithink. And while we're here, I alsowanted to say that one of oneimprovement that I want to do, anotherimprovement thatI just throwing things on the ground.One thing that I want to improve aboutmy desk is actually I want to getanother one of these pegboard thingiesto put right on top of here. I feel likeit'll elongate the desk, but then alsomy keyboard collection has been growing,so I need more space to put them onhere. Another thing that I improved onmy desk is I got a stream deck. I'mactually really grateful because I hadthat on my throne for my birthday.People in the community actually helpedme crowdfund this. So, thank you guys. Ireally appreciate you. This has changedthe game for streaming and it's made itso much easier for me and made meimprove streaming just in general. So,I'm really happy about that. Still liketo keep my iPad back here becausesometimes I have stuff to do in my iPad.I actually recently started drawing myown emotes. So, I've been doing that forthe last couple days and I need my iPadfor that. So, I've been using that. Anddown here, this is this has been a lifechanger for me. I got this at thebeginning of the year. This is a weeklyplanner. I just write down all thethings that I have to do. Keeps meorganized. It looks really nice andsimple and pretty. And yeah, I alsorecently got this mouse pad. I love theshape. I love the color. It's easy toclean and it's there. This is also themouse that came with this keyboard here.It's simple and it's there and it worksso I use it. I recently got thiskeyboard because I'm actually doing acollaboration with a keycap companywhich that video might be out by thetime this is out. So, I will maybe linkit if it's out. I'm really reallyexcited for that. It's like the perfectmatch made in heaven. So, I cannot waitfor you guys to see that. All right,what else do we have? We have mybeautiful and amazing andincredible computer. Incredible.Amazing. Showstoppping. This is thecomputer that I built last year. I mean,there's really not much I can say aboutit. It's a 10 out of 10. I still reallylove it. Patcha also loves it. What doyou think? It's working perfectly. Itstill looks beautiful. It's easy toclean. And yeah, I really have nocomplaints. A new thing that startedhappening after I moved actually was Istarted a silly little magnetcollection. Most of these are magnetsthat have been given to me. So, I justreally love it. It's a really cutelittle way that you can customize yourcomputer and it's just fun to collectstuff. I have this monkey jungle onefrom a place here in Florida, which ifyou live in Miami and you haven't beento Monkey Jungle, you have to. It'sreally It's a really great place. Irecommend especially if you like feedingcute monkeys. I have these egg ones andthis little blob one that were a gift.This snail one was also a gift from aloved one. This frog one was a gift fromNick. If you're watching, I love you.Thank you. This one was a gift from mybrother. And then I have this one thatlooks like Patcha. My legs are hurtingfrom sitting here. Anyway, a new thingthat I did get recently because of someof my comments in that video where Ibuilt this PC, people were telling menot to put it directly on the groundbecause it would get a lot of dustunderneath. So, I actually got thislittle platform to be able to move itaround and clean itbetter. God, that's been really reallyhelpful to move it around for whateverreason. This guy is really, really heavyand I'm always really apprehensive aboutcarrying it and moving it around becauseI'm afraid that I'm going to drop it orsomething. I'm very clumsy. Okay, if youhave your PC directly on the ground,maybe consider getting one of those cuzit's a game changer for me. Hello. Hi.I'm I'm still here. I'm just out offrame. Okay. I feel like in thesestores, people don't really talk aboutthis. The way that they organize theirstuff on their drawers, and I'm kind ofnosy about that. I don't know about you.So, I'm going to show you how I organizethings in my drawers really quick. Okay,in this drawer, this is like the drawer.Oh, there's hair. This where I keep myhair. This is the drawer where I keepall of the things that I need to accesson a dayto-day basis. I have someheadphones. I have my glasses, stuff toremove key caps and clean them, pens,all that good stuff. Erasers, stickers,very, very helpful. I have a wholedrawer filled with fidget toys. I amvery, very neurode divergent and I likefidget toys for that reason. They reallyhelp me focus some days. They help me onstream, all that good stuff. I also havethis random brain cell plushy which ifyou know you know I guess from mystreams. And then back here I have awhole stack of my planners and notebooksthat I use on a day-to-day basis to keepme organized. All of that good stuff.Down here I literally have a wholedrawer of cozy crafting. I mean I have alot more cozy crafting stuff but theseare the things that I reach for on aregular basis. And it's mostly just mycoloring books. I have a lot of them.The Heartstoppper coloring book. It's socute. I have my Hoohoohoo markers andyeah, just like random things that Imight need like measuring tape and stufffor writing letters and stuff like that.Down here, I have some miscellaneousstuff. As you can see, this is mostlyjust where I like to keep my laptop cuzI like for it to have a nice organizedplace for it to be in. And I also havelike a random lighter, my Bluetoothheadphones, and atripod. And then down here, I just haveall of the things that I use for filmingpretty much. I have like an extrawebcam. I have a light. This is where Ikeep my camera when not I'm notrecording, batteries, chargers, SDcards, wires, all of that really fun,not very aesthetic stuff. The last thingI would like to show you is this chair.I did not buy this chair. This was agift from my brother. He had an extrachair and he was like, ""Do you want it?""And I said, ""Yes."" I really love it.It's an extra large, which is a bit bigfor me, but it ends up working out cuz Ican like cross my legs on it and sitlike a gremling as I always do when I'mediting. I still have the same blanketthat I got in my building my dream setupvideo. I think that's it. I also have areally cute cat that sometimes likes tohang out over here. What do you have tosay foryourself? Exactly. All righty. Back tome. When I made that video last year, Ithere were a lot of things that I stillwanted to improve on. And some of thethings I have, some of those things Ihaven't. I feel like a gaming setup is aplace that just naturally improves overtime. This is my happy place. This iswhere I spent most of my time in.Whether it is working, filming, editing,streaming, playing games with myfriends. I hope you like this tour. Letme know what you thought of this video.I would love to hear your thoughts inthe comments. If you like this video,remember to give it a like andsubscribe. But most importantly,remember to take care of yourself. Havesome rest, have some water, and I'll seeyou in the next video. Bye.[Music]","A proud member of the nosey community

Seeing the little frog on your shelf made my heart so warm, you’re such a sweetie 

Pacha having to resort to violence in order the get the attention she is entitled to, poor thing at one point I feel like I could see her saying “why are you talking into that q-tip???”

Actually,you probably can't because I have him.No, I'm done. We made a boo boo. It's sopretty. It's so pretty.[Music]Hey guys, welcome or welcome back to mychannel. My name is Destiny if youdidn't already know. And as you can seebehind me, there's a desk fully loadedwith everything. And if you're comingfrom my last video where I did my wholedesk setup cuz I was building it, I toldyou guys I was going to build a PC aswell. And guess what? I built my PC. Andshe's standing right here, right next tome. And y'all y'all are going to see it.You guys are going to see it. You justhave to keep watching the video. Um, Ijust would like to say the last video Iposted about my desk was about 4 monthsago. I understand that, but life wasfalling apart. I was in school takingfive classes. Why would I do that tomyself? I don't know. Actually, I doknow. I want to get up and get out ofschool now that we're in summer. I mean,it's not that any better. I'm takingthree classes in the summer, but I havesome more time than taking five, sowe're good. However, yes, there is afully loaded desk behind me. And I didfilm me building my PC. There was a lotof mishaps. Um, I filmed a video of mebuilding my PC and I never end upshowing you the final product. So, thisthis recording will be me showing thefinal product.[Music]Um, push it down like this. You know,I'm not pushing it all the way down.Yeah, go all the way down. Oh, it broke.Oh my goodness. You broke it. Now, thisis a lot of resistance. I can'tI'm not doing that. I'm already hearingstuff. push doesn't me Jeff. I'm I don'twant to break the stuff. That's Thereyou go. I feel like a tech geek. I feellike qualify to be in tech. Like Ishould be making 200k a year. Knock itdown. Stop putting it up. You're makinghair partic follicles. No one's going tosee it. Do X or dots. What is this? Canyou stick it on, Jeff? It looks likedamn worm. Looks like stick it on.Jeff, please screw it in. You're makingme nervous. So, currently, um, we made aboo boo. We have to wipe off the thermalpaste cuz I put way too much cuz I havea happy hand. I I I thought more morether thermal paste was good. It's not.Um, update. It's an hour and a halflater. Um, I'm not sure if we're evenclose to being done. What we did dothough is we changed out the fans thatthis PC came with because I heard thatit's loud. It's not that good. And nowI'm just installing the mothermotherboard. How'd you turn it on? Allright. So, uh, it's on. It's on. Butthere's still a yellow light.But this time, the yellow light's forthe RAM. So, that's lowkey better thanthe CPU. Yes. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.Do you understand how many how muchtimes we had to take off the CPU? Atleast it's not the CPU this time. All wehave to do is just uncip. Why are weturning off and on though? Ah, it's sopretty. So pretty. It's so pretty. Sopretty. So pretty. After furtheranalysis,it is not a RAM issue. It's a VGA andthat means GPU. We don't got a GPU. Stopshaking the camera. Excited. We don'thave a GPU. So that's fine. We're goingto get the GPU tomorrow. Do you know howmany hours it took us? We started atlike 6:15 yesterday. Yes. And it's like10:00. It's 9:00 right now. It is thenext day. Say hi, Jeff. Hello. The PC isdone. It's done. It's finished. It'scute. She's She's real cute in all herglory and everything. Um, two thingsthat we still need to install that camein today. I got my GPU today. It'sstanding right here. And then I alsohave my fan right here. And then I havemy cable management that I just orderedfrom Amazon that came in yesterday. Lookat the little turmoil, the actual likestress we went through. See, there's alot of time skips, a lot of jumps. Ididn't record a lot cuz one, my cameradied. I didn't have a spare battery andit just got too technical.That that was that the snap? No. Are yousure? That's the wrong snap.Are you sure? Yeah. Why don't Don't dothat. Don't do some.I'm going to tell you guys all theprices I spent on everything and if Idon't remember, I'll just put it in myAmazon link. I think it's already in thedescription below, but if I missanything that I said in the video, letme know and I'll just add it to thelink. I would say personally for me, mydesk setup is a budget friendly desksetup. Now, when you find out the pricethat I pay for everything, you may notsay that it's a a budget friendly desksetup, but everything that I got was notall at once. I literally got my deskback in November. What month is it?June. Every time I would try to buysomething for my desk, I would alwaysmake sure it's the cheapest option. It'scute, but still the cheapest option. So,I'm doing my best here. Without furtherado, come closer and let's go get intothe desk tour. Okay, so first let's getinto the peripherals. I believe that'swhat you call it, peripherals, andthat's like the keyboard, mouse,speakers, or whatever that's connectedto the monitor or the PC. I think that'sthe peripherals. Also, the lightingchanges in this video. I've had thisCanon G7X for like 3 4 years now, and Istill don't know how to use it. So, I'mtrying my best. I'm trying my best. Andwith every video that I post from nowon, it's going to get better. So, myfirst thing that I love is my keyboard.I did mention this in my last video. Itis a Miji Majigi Maji keyboard. I thinkI got this for like $35 on Amazon. It'sthe prettiest keyboard. It's blue andpurple. I wanted a all purple keyboard,but I couldn't find one. Like a allwhite and purple keyboard, but Icouldn't find one. So, there's a ant onmy keyboard. Calm down.Let's calm down. Um, I feel like theblue kind of matches my mouse pad, so itdoesn't really matter. And then I alsogot this on Amazon. I have no idea whatthe price was for this. I think this wasabout maybe $18.99 or 12. It's either$12.99 or $18.99. One of the both. Ifeel like like that's a good price forthis. It's purple. And if you guysdidn't know already, my favorite coloris purple. I don't use this, by the way.I hate the feeling of a wrist rest onme. It feels so like constricting,claustrophobic. I don't know what it is,but I don't like it. So, I don't use it,but it is there for the aestheticswhenever I want to take photos. I gotthis mouse cuz my previous mouse was awhite mouse that was like $10 on Amazonand it stopped working. I don't knowwhat happened. I didn't drop it. Ididn't pour water on it. Nothinghappened to it. It just stopped working.It stopped connecting. Like, it turnson. The blue light will turn on. Iconnected to my computer and it justdoesn't move. So, I don't really know.So, I ended up getting this one. I thinkthis one was about like $28 or maybe itwas 30. I don't know. This is a littlebit more expensive. This is the LogitechG305 mouse and it's really good. I likeit. You could change the DPI. It's u Ithink that's what it's called. The thebasically how fast the the sensitivityof the mouse is. It does have a loudclicker though.I don't like that. My other mouse that Igot for $10.99 on Amazon, no soundclick. You couldn't hear it forBut now,no, I'm done. There's not much I can do.Um, for my webcam, I got my webcammainly for streaming and I haven'tstreamed yet because I'm trying to finda good schedule since I do work a 9 to5and every time after my 9 to5 I getsleepy and tired. We're we're working onit. I forgot what it's called, but Ithink it's in my Amazon storefront, butit's the Logitech C920,I think, or something. But it's reallygood. It's super good. If you ever getthis webcam and you're like, ""Oh mygosh, Destiny lights me. It's not thatgood."" It's because you don't reallyhave great lighting. any camera, if youdon't have good lighting, like lightingon the left and right of you, not evenjust in front of you, like on the leftand right of you, it's going to lookbad. I make this 1080p HD camera looklike it's a 4K camera. I'm sorry. Youjust need to get into the lighting. Youneed to get on YouTube. You need to geton TikTok and figure out the bestlighting setups for when you'restreaming or for webcams or whatever,and you're going to get just right. Igot this for, I think, like $80. It'sexpensive for a camera that is 1080p,but it's not that bad. Now, if we gocloser, this part came with the deskthat I built. Yeah, I use it just forlike just to hide everything that'sunder here. I might take this out justbecause it makes my desk feel a littlebit smaller than it is. Like if I put itright here, it may look a little bitnicer, but my desk feels smaller. Buteither way, let's take this out and seewhat's under it. So, what I have underit is my speakers for my monitor and myKVM switch. First of all, the best thingI've ever bought with my money is thisKVM switch. I was so stressed before Igot this KVM switch, y'all. Every singletime I wanted to switch from working cuzI work from my work laptop. My worklaptop is a 2017 MacBook Air that my jobgave to me. And then I have my PC,y'all. Every time I wanted to game on myPC or go on Discord or just go on my PCto use my keyboard, I would have toswitch. I'm sorry, y'all. I had tochange the SD card cuz it was full. Soanyways, back to what I was saying.Every time I literally would have tounplug my mouse, unplug my keyboard,unplug my speaker, and transfer back tomy PC. And then the next morning, I haveto do this for 5 days straight, by theway. The next morning, transfer them allback to this connection to put itconnected to my laptop. I'm sick of it.And then I found out about KVM switches.It's this black box right here, right?There's a big button in the middle. Youput all your peripherals right here,which is your mouse, keyboard, and Ialso have my what's it called? My what'sit called? camera, my webcam that I justshowed you guys connected to this. So,it just automatically switches. So, whathappens is is as soon as I press thisbutton in the middle, it'll switch over.I press it again. Right now, it'sconnected to my laptop. So, this lightturns on and it'll switch over to mylaptop. If you're someone that worksfrom home and you have a work from homecomputer and you don't want and theydon't allow you to work from your PC,you need a KVM switch cuz changing theseconnections is ridiculous. And I'm overit. I was done. thing I got is I thinkeveryone has this speaker and I fellinto consumerism. I saw everyone on TikTok who had a cute little desk setuphave this speaker so I bought it. I onceI played music on it I was like waitthis is not loud cuz I was expectinglike a Beats pill type of um speaker.Yeah, you're not going to get that withthis. But it's pretty loud y'all. It isloud. It's pretty loud for if you'rejust trying to listen to music in yourroom. It is loud. I believe I got thisfor like $18.99. It was pretty good. Um,it does what I need it to do. So, I'mvery happy that I made this purchase.Also, if you haven't noticed already, mymonitor is purple. It's black on thefront, obviously, cuz that's the screen,but it is purple on the back. And Ithink that's the cutest thing in theworld. First of all, we could really getinto it because I love Pixio so much.They have so many colors and in myopinion is budget friendly consideringthat if you're trying to buy a pinkmonitor or white monitor in thiseconomy, that pink and white tax iscrazy. So, the fact that you can getpink, white, purple, blue, green withouthaving to be uh separated of price, likepink is not more expensive than purple.White is not more expensive than blue.Now, for my monitor arm, I love thismonitor arm down. I was lucky enough toget this as a sample from Tik Tok shop,and I love it so much. It actually comeswith two arms, but I took the other armoff because I'm not utilizing a doublemonitor setup right now. But, it's likea gas spring um monitor arm, so it'sreally nice. It goes up smoothly. Goesdown, goes up. And then if I wanted itto turn sideways, it can. Oop, you'refalling. You're falling up. And then ifI wanted to turn it back, it's like it'sit's really maneuverable. It's easy andI love it. It's my favorite thing in theworld. And yeah, she's all crooked now.I'm messing up my desk setup for youguys. So, I really hope that you guysleave a like, you subscribe, and leave acomment about what's your favorite thingabout my desk setup. Or you can just sayhi. And then obviously right here wehave my favorite mic in the world. Imean, I don't really have too manyexperience with other mics to decide onthis, but I got this mic for like $59 or$55, I think, cuz I got it on sale. Bestmic in the world. It's beautiful. I useit for my voiceover sometimes, and it'sreally good. Oh, and before I move on,forget this um mic arm was gifted to meby my boyfriend. I have no idea how muchhe spent on it, but I'm sure that youcould find one for maybe like $25 onAmazon. I also got this. This is for myphone for whenever I'm working. I put myphone on here and I play YouTube videoswhile I work. If I don't, I'm fallingasleep. That's just that's just how itis. So, I have to have something playingon my phone at all times. Here comes thelast few sections of my desk. It's veryclear. There's nothing here. Well,there's some stuff here, but let's getinto it. I like to keep my desk clearbecause I do have papers here sometimes.Sometimes I like to eat my food here.This is my work laptop. I bought a alaptop riser or something. I just put itright here just so when I do open up mylaptop, it's somewhat level with myscreen. It's not. It literally stopsright here. You get what you get and youdon't get upset. Um, this is my PS5controller with the skin that I boughtalso on Amazon. This is not a goodheadset. This headset is not good. Itleaks sound and the mic's alreadybroken. Don't know why. I've had it for2 weeks and it's broken. Got it fromAmazon. You're getting returned. I havethis little bear that my friend from mybook club Discord that got for me. Shecrocheted this together and it's thecutest thing in the world. I don't havea name. I don't have a name for her. Ifyou have a name I can name my cow, letme know. This is supposed to be a coffeeshop that I'm supposed to build, and Iclearly have not gotten back to it. Andthen there's down here, but we're notreally going to get into too much intoit. That's just a whole bunch ofmiscellaneous stuff. This area issupposed to be my content creation sidewhere I have my tripods and content ideanotebooks and peripherals or whatever Iwas going to store here. I'm too lazy toclean it, but one of these days I'mgoing to clean it. There's a videothat's going to come out about it. Downhere, this isn't actually supposed to bea foot stool. I just found it in myhouse and it's a foot stool. You willnever catch me at my desk without usingmy foot stool. I cannot and will not sitat my desk if there's nothing to hold myfoot. Down there is my PS5. Why? Cuzwhere in the world am I going to put myPS5? Nowhere. My PC is taking up thisside. Oh, there's my bed. It's quiteugly. Just ignore it. This is too shortto have this there. And I don't know ifI really I don't think I want to have myPlayStation just sitting right there. Imean, obviously not because I have mywork laptop here. Oh, how'd you fall,girl? Come on. Put you back up. Butyeah, so she's chilling down there.She's fine. She's She's, you know, she'sseparated from all the fun, but she'sgood. Okay, so we're back and that'severything that's on my desk. I swear toyou, I don't think I missed everythingthat's on my desk. The rest of my desk,I turned this into like a bookish shelfor whatever. I have Six of Crows righthere in the Crooked Kingdom. That's aduogy that's sitting right here. Andthen I have We Hunt the Flame and Leethe Stars.

I actuallyjust have never gotten the time to readthis book. I will I will read it. I whatI wanted to do was make this into mymanga shelf, but then I realized howexpensive manga is. Um I do have sololeveling somewhere here. I think it'sright here, but yeah, I'm not going totake it down. So, until your girl canlike make some moola, if you want me tomake this into my manga show, subscribeand watch my videos. That's all you gotto do. Subscribe and watch my videos.

Um, I alsodo have Zenitsu right here. He is a snowglobe. I got this from Five Below. Ithink this was like 350. Yeah, we gotZenitsu in a snow globe. Shake what helooks like. Real cute. Real cute. Thisis a daily planner that I bought that Idon't use. I bought this like 2 yearsago and I absolutely do not use it,unfortunately. I really should. It's anice planner. Like, it has priorities onit. It has a schedule from 6:00 a.m. to10:00 p.m., which honestly I likebecause your girl wants to start wakingup early. I literally wake up at 8:45a.m. every day. I want to start wakingup at like 7:00 a.m. or 7:30. And I wantthat to be the norm. Um, where I couldjust naturally wake up at 7:00 or 7:30,but like just have some time to myself.I have so much stuff going on in mylife. If I have some time before work,like me time, I could even maybe getback into reading cuz y'all know I'm ina reading slump for like 5 monthsalready. So, and then we have some extrastuff. So, I have like my uh like alittle mug right here, a candle. This ismy Bible that I got. This is the SheReads Truth Bible, the ChristianStandard Bible, and it has all thesethese labels of the books in the Bible.And she's so cute. I love it. Soaesthetic. Um I bring this to churchwith me every Sunday. Lastly, there's awhole bunch of stuff. I'm sorry. Justgive me a second. I have a trophy thatmy mom got me for when I was turning 21.It said, ""Congrats on adulting."" Andthen I got I have a painting that me andmy boyfriend painted. I have a poem thatmy boyfriend wrote for me right there.As you can see, I love my boyfriend alot and he loves me a lot, too. And thenI have this. I don't know what these arecalled, but this was gifted to me byChe. It's a Inside Out uh octopus. Realcute. Real cute. My essential oilsdiffuser. You guys want to see the PCand hear about it? Just give me asecond. Just give me a second. I swear.Just give me a second of your time and Iwill get to it just after this. And thenright here, I also have a little doorwhere I keep everything and anythingthat my boyfriend gives to me or that wedo together. He also got me this rosefor our three-year anniversary, and it'sone of my favorite book quotes ever. Hestalked my apparently, he stalked myTikTok, and he found a book quote that Ireally, really loved, and then he hadsomeone make it into a rose. It says, itsays, ""I was born into this world tolove you and I will love youin the next life and the one afterthat."" The cutest thing ever. Get you aboyfriend like mine. Actually, youprobably can't because I have him. Okay.Anyway, sorry. All right, I get it. Youhave literally been waiting for this thewhole video. You wanted to see the PCand how it came out, and this is how itcame out. It's the cutest PC I've everhad. Um, I actually didn't think it wasgoing to fully come out like this, andI'm very happy. You're probablywondering, Destiny, I thought you wanteda all white setup. I did, but rememberwhen I was talking earlier about thatwhite tax? Yeah. Mm- mm- When you wantto buy things white, it is so expensive.So, the two black things that I ended upgetting was the motherboard and then myGPU. I'm not mad at it. And it's reallynice. So, let me show you. This is thefront of the PC. I have a USBC, twoUSBs, and then a headphone jack. Andthis is my power button. My fans areright here. I have a total of six fans.I have two fans at the bottom righthere. Three fans on the side and then Ihave one fan in the back. And then yeah,this is what it looks like. It's socute. On the inside, I have Mikasa righthere on sitting on top of my GPU. I maybe a hypocrite. Um, I have Tony TonyChopper. Did I watch One Piece? Yes. Howmany episodes did I watch? 150. And thenI stopped. But I got to the point whereI met him and he I fell in love withhim. Can you be mad at me? Look how cutehe is. This is my GPU. Got these likelight up cord covers or whatever. It'sreally nice. I got them in the back,too. And then this is my favorite partof my PC. This is kind of what broughtmy PC together. I really recommend ifyou are not going the liquid coolingway, which I definitely recommend youdon't because like if you're buildingyour PC for the first time and you don'tknow what you're doing, you candefinitely damage your PC by installingthe installing the liquid cooler wrong.And then also it's more expensive. It'sthe second biggest and thickest piece inyour PC. And I did not want it to lookugly. But luckily, I found this uhcooler on eBay. Um cuz apparently it'snot made in the US. It's notmanufactured in the US. It's banned orwhatever. I bought this on eBaysecondhand. But this lights up. So I'mgoing to show you guys. But this lightsup. It tells me the temperature and it'sit's like a LED screen in there. It'sreally nice. And I'm going to show youright now. So let's turn this up.[Music]Okay, it's on. For some reason, it justloaded up really slow today. Uh, don'tknow why you're embarrassing me. This isat Celsius. I could also change it toFahrenheit if I wanted to, but Celsiusjust looks prettier. I want to see twonumbers, not three. It's my favoritepart, and it just brings everything inmy PC together. If my cooler did nothave a screen, I wouldn't love my PC asmuch. I would still love my PC cuz lookhow beautiful it is. But compare that tojust having a LD LED screen. It justlooks so much more high tech and it'snicer. What I spent on this PC, I may ormay have not used my financial aid, butthis is for school purposes. But I spent$1,500 on my PC. I got my CPU coolerused and then I got my GPU used. Um,very much a gamble on the GPU, but itworks fine. Um, I'm not having anyissues. I hate my chair so much. It isso flat to the point I have to buy thislike cushion. Usually end up putting thecushion down on the floor cuz I justhate it so much. This in general is soflat it hurts my butt. Pretty basicchair. There's nothing wrong with it. Imean, I'll live with it for now. It's aboneless chair. It hurts. I sit in itfor 8 hours a day longer sometimes cuzI'll just get off my computer for like 2hours, go to sleep, and get back on itcuz I want to play video games. So, Ijust love how this looks like a cubicle.Anyways, that's it for this video. Ifyou liked my desk tour and you want tosee more about me talking about my deskor my PC, if you want me to break downevery single thing that I got, cuz Iwill. I made a list. My boyfriend made alist and he can help me. He can be herein the video to do it as well. Um, I ama beginner. I am a beginner ateverything. I built this PC with him. Ijust helped him pass him the parts. Imaybe like put some PC parts together,but I didn't do everything. Oh, I forgotto show you. My boyfriend also got methis crochet um flower pot. Cutest thingever. I love it so much. And it'ssitting on my on my desk. Anyways, ifyou like this video, leave a like.Comment down below what you loved aboutmy desk or let me know if there'sanything else I could add. I feel likemy desk is pretty bland. I did forget toshow you that I have these um leaves upabove my desk. Only this part looksnice. The middle part keeps falling. Butanyways, yeah, that's basically it. I'llsee you guys in the next video. Bye.","What am I missing from my setup? I plan on adding more decorations! (P.S- Watch in 1.5x speed! It is more fun!)

Hey. Hey.[Music]So, I'm currently working on unpackingall of theboxes because currently my room lookslike this. We didn't have anywhere elseto put all of our boxes and furnitureand stuff.

Heat.[Music]so this is what it's looking like rightnow. The plant that I showed youearlier, I put this up. Didn't know whatto put in here, so I kind of just putsome plushies in there just to fill itout. The setup itself is pretty similarto the one in my previous room. Thisroom gets like a lot more lighting, Iwould say, than my previous room. Ignoremy dead plants. So, I'm really excitedto create content in here. And also, I'mworking on stuff like uh around my roomhere. I will also film this and makevideo on it. So, my cable managementright now is it's doing the job for now,but I definitely want to clean this up abit more, find out where to put thisone. But, it works for now. Uh does thejob. And you can't really see it likewhen I'm creating content fromhere. I had to pause cuz I got mydominoes. It's pretty empty still likearound here. So, I'm planning on maybedoing some hanging plants or somethinghere. And I also want to put up my RGBpanels like the triangle ones. So,that's basically it for today's video.Thank you so much for watching and I'llsee you in the next one.

fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I spent over $50,000 on my gaming setups over the years, and today I'm reacting to a hundred of the best gaming setups from my Discord to see if they're better than mine. And these aren't just any normal setups. They're all submitted by tech tryhards and my community that goes hard on their setups. And I'll be rating every single one. By the end of the video, you can decide if it's better than mine. From kids with daddy's money to extremely budget setups and insane gaming setups, and they only get crazier. So, let's start with the first one. This is Austin. He's 14 years old and he got his setup through jobs and from birthday money. Cool. That's awesome. His main games are Fortnite and Rocket League, which is cool. So, Gutsy Aiden Tech Source inspires him. That's awesome. He finished the setup 1 month ago and it took him about 3 years to build, which is cool. It was just an old TV and Xbox setup. So, he's really upgraded since then. That's awesome. Take a look. Mo keyboard and a Gro wireless. And then he has a MacBook Air for his computer. And he wants to get a gaming PC. Uh here's a shelf to the left. Has a little bit of personality on it. some keyboards and some things he's made, which is pretty cool. It looks really good so far. Um, so yeah, it helped him by getting a new monitor. So, that's really cool. And then providing it with other ways to earn money as well. So, that's pretty cool. I think some parents do that, but you know, they help you out by getting some money by letting uh you work on some stuff. And, you know, that's really cool. Setup for gaming and streaming. Interesting. Um, looks like a console and MacBook Air setup. That's really cool. He wants to play games like Valerant when he gets PC. Austin setup is really strong. I think he's got a really good setup for the most part. I mean, it looks really good. I love that he has a mouse pad for me as well. It's a really good budget setup for sure, especially for console. This is Florine setup. I hope I said your name right. They're 16. They got their setup through saving through Christmas and birthdays. They live in Germany. Pretty cool setup already. Love this already. Looking awesome. Took about 3 days to build. Loving the Alex drawer here. Loving the the wallpapers as well on this on this build to build the setup for gaming. Okay. 3050. Okay. an i5. Interesting PC specs here. 32 gigs of Corsera RAM, too. Awesome. Corsair 4000D airflow case. Intel uh 1 TB SSD and MSI Z490 for the mother motherboard as well. Looking like a Red Dragon K552 for the keyboard. And it looks like a Razer Viper V2, a Razor Viper Ultimate. Okay, I really just love this setup, man. It looks awesome. Mainly plays War Zone 2 as well. The main monitor is an ASUS 27 in 1080p for 60 Hz. could upgrade that over time. Asus 22 inch 1080p as well. And his inspirations is me and Tech Source, so I appreciate that. That's awesome. His old setup was a monitor and PS4. Awesome. Florine setup's really, really nice. I just love the the panels on the wall, the clock, all that. What do you guys rate it in chat? Uh, the bezels could be better, obviously. But again, this is a budget setup episode, so it's looking awesome. 7 out of 10. 6.9 out of 10. Yeah, it looks really good. This is Gusher's setup. I hope I said your name right. He's 11 years old. PS4 or PS5 setup. Interesting. 11 years old. He got a setup. They're saving for Christmas and birthday money. Uh he lives in the UK. This is like the uh the cable management behind the monitor there. Looking like the PC could use some cable management as well. Holy. It was just his old setup was just a TV and Xbox. So, he's kind of done this and I've inspired him. So, that's awesome. He's got just a regular 27in monitor. Very, very simple. He mainly plays Fortnite. Okay. So, Fortnite. He's got a nice keyboard, mouse there. Both Logitech. Got some uh different cool posters on the wall. Looks like they're all Star Wars related. Desk actually looks pretty cable managed and looks very clean under here. I really like this. So, it's looking really awesome. He's 11 years old, which is really really young, you know. So, for to have a console setup, it honestly is really solid for what it what he has. There's not a whole lot he really can improve besides getting a PC or, you know, upgrading things. So, Harris's setup. He is 13 years old and he got his setup through saving for Christmas and birthday money, but also helping his parents with work. Interesting. Okay, cool. Looking really Oh, I just love the the laptop stand there. Um, he's from Lithuania. Wow, that's a that's crazy. Uh, his inspirations are me and TechSource. That's awesome. I' I love that I can inspire you. I love the laptop on the edge right there, like on a stand. It's really cool. using an HP Gaming Pavilion laptop that has Ryzen 7 and a 1660Ti, which is really nice. His old setup was boring and had no color theme. So, it had no color theme there. Looks really good. Honestly, I just love the the aesthetic you've got going on for this budget setup. I mean, this is really good for for a younger kid here. Mainly use it for school and gaming. Love the cable management. It's honestly pretty good. I would say maybe just a raceway would help, but other than that, everything else looks solid. looking like he's rocking the Logitech G335s and these are actually pretty good. Pretty good headset there on the budget side of things. Also love the RK61 keyboard there. And I think he's also running a Logitech G305. Nice. And I just love the aesthetic, his upgrades he wants to make is he wants to get a PC and some Nano Leafs to kind of fill in the vibe and finish it all up. Just love what he's got going on. And it does it shows that you don't need a fancy computer or anything crazy, you know? You just you could have a laptop and still rock it like this. So, it looks really good, man. Good job. Uh, for now, he's really happy. That's awesome. I'm glad that some people are happy with just having, you know, a laptop setup. Looks really good, man. Good, good job with this. The Alex Shores and the pegboard are from IKEA, which is cool. So, he's got 27in LG for the main monitor and then his plants are from IKEA as well. So, honestly, I think this setup is really, really underrated for this kind of budget setup. I mean, he's just rocking a laptop and he really made the space look good along with the laptop, which I really like. Some people just kind of throw a laptop on a desk and call it a day. But I love that he has a stand for it. You know, he plugged it all in and got it really solid. This is Harry's setup now. He's 12 years old. He got a setup through helping my parents around the house, which is cool. So, he did some chores to get it. I love this setup already. He lives in Georgia. The desk could use some work, but everything else in the setup looks pretty solid so far. He mainly plays Valerant. Awesome. Did I inspire him? Dude, a lot of you guys are inspired by me. That's awesome. Uh, he wants to start streaming in the future, so this is going to be a streaming and gaming setup here. He's running an RK61 as his main keyboard and then a Glorious Modelo as his main mouse. In the future, he wants a better desk and maybe, you know, some different monitor, stuff like that. That's cool. And he also wants a better PC. His main monitor is a MSI 1080p 144 hertz. Actually, really good monitor and a Spectre 1080 75 Hz as a secondary. It's took about 2 years to build this setup from saving up. Yes, the desk needs some work. PCs probably uh need some work as well, but overall, I mean, it's really good. It's It's honestly really solid for his age and what he's got built so far. In my opinion, I feel like this is a really solid one. Chat, what are we thinking about this so far? I I feel like this is a really good setup for what he's got and what he's got going. I think the cable man could be a little better. Honestly, not that not that huge of a deal. I mean, it looks pretty manage. So, 7.5 out of 10. Not horrible. Yeah, not horrible at all. Kingston, he's 13 years old and he got the setup through Christmas gifts, shoveling snow, and other odd jobs. Interesting. only 13. Looks like we're running a console setup here. He lives in Alberta, Canada. Okay. Make sure with the It makes sense with the the shoveling snow. He got it set up by uh his main passion for competitive gaming and content creation. Interesting. He doesn't have a PC currently, so he's just running a PS4. He wants to become a content creator, which is cool. You know, you can always improve. Um he has a Razer Viper Ultimate and a mouse that he a keyboard and mouse that he doesn't know. Okay, so he doesn't know the keyboard and mouse or the keyboard's name, but he knows the mouse name, which is cool. Yeah. I also really like where his mic is cuz I feel like the mic is in a really good position. Yeah, it looks really good. He wants a new PC and a second monitor and he wants to mount them as well, which is a good that's pretty good. He needs he needs that as well. But I really love the the whole setup. Like I think it could use some more cable management obviously like what we're looking at needs some more cable management. You know, he obviously needs to upgrade his PC and stuff like that. But overall, I really do enjoy how like you kind of worked with what you had. I mean, you have a charger for your mouse here. You got, you know, your PS4 controller if you need it. But you also play on keyboard and mouse and you have like, you know, your peripherals that you need. So, you got the essentials. Rick's setup. He's 14 years old and he got his setup through working some and also birthday money. Sorry. Yeah. And also birthday money. Cool. That's awesome. So, he's 14 years old. He's from Lat Lativa. Lati Lativa. I think I said that right. Um, he mainly plays Fortnite. I didn't even know that people from these countries know who I am. He uses it for school, gaming, and work. That's awesome. It took him about two years to build the entire setup. His keyboard is a Genesis Thor 300 TKL. I've never heard of that brand. And a Del Taco gaming mouse. Interesting. It does sell. It does say Del Taco Gaming. That's funny. He's running a Samsung G3 27 in 144 hertz monitor. And it looks like he wants a second monitor with a stand to have both the monitors. Me and Tech Source inspire him. And the cable management looks pretty good as well. Pretty good. Yeah. 16 gigs of RAM, 3060 Ti, and Intel i5, which is pretty good. Pretty good starter build for sure. But I love the theme of this setup, you know? I I really love how he's kind of just built a nice cool looking wall behind it. The colors match. Like, he did a really good job on the color theme. The only thing that kind of bugs me about the setup is the clutter on the left side. Like you can see all this stuff just kind of sitting on the desk. I would have liked to see it like a little bit decluttered. Looks really, really good to start. Dylan setup. He's 16 years old and he got his setup through working at McDonald's. Pretty cool. Uh, he lives in south of England. Cool. I love the desk, too. I think this this desk is kind of underrated. I don't like the keyboard tray in my opinion. I hate those things. Like the way that the setup looks and the um the aesthetic is actually pretty good. Uh he mainly plays Minecraft, Fortnite, and Rocket League. Some YouTubers that he watches uh inspires him. He had a cheap laptop that stopped running and so he decided to upgrade to this setup here. Looks like it's underneath a bunk bed somehow. It took him about a week to put together everything. He built the PC himself. That's awesome. Here is the specs right here. Looking like an i7 2700 KF 3060 Ti and a 32 gig of RAM set there as well. It looks like he's running a stricks motherboard as well. Looks really nice, by the way. Really good build. He wanted to upgrade the GPU and CPU as well once he gets uh some more money. And here's the keyboard and mouse combo. Looks like some budget setup here. Budget stuff. Uh I love this Stranger Things too. This like little like the old what are they called? VHS tape. VHS. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like the VHS thing. It has like RGB on it. I think it's really cool that like this is in this setup cuz I've never seen anything like this. It adds to the aesthetic, which is really cool. So, I think that overall this setup, I'd probably rate it like a 6 out of 10. But overall, I love what you're going. I see the vision. I see the vision for it. It looks really awesome. So, keep it up and good luck in the voting. This is Will's setup. He's 14 years old and his dad bought him this setup. He's from Columbus or Columbus, Ohio. most normal looking Ohio setup chat. Here we go. He mainly plays Fortnite and Roblox and my friends or his friends and some streamers inspired him to build this setup. Yeah. So, his streamers in inspire him. He uses this setup to mainly play games which is awesome. And he's planning to get a second monitor because ship switching between tabs is annoying. And then his old setup was just a MacBook. So, he's got a PC now. Cable management could be better. I mean, you should try to take care of it. Cable management could be a necessity here. The PC looks pretty okay. Looks like some 46 of RAM. I don't know what kind of specs we got, but this is the best picture we have. So, looks pretty good. Um, okay. So, we're going to vote. So, the way we're going to do this is you guys are going to say, you're going to vote your favorite setup out of these four. Starting poll now. Everybody vote in the polls right now. Everybody vote which setup do you think should win? And I'm going to show them back on the screen really quick so you guys can vote. So, you guys can see each setup. Let me hide myself. Here are all the setups here. You guys can vote. Dang, Floren's winning, dude. Essentially, the person that wins this one will go on to the next round and then we'll vote the other five and then put one on one and we'll do like whoever wins. Florian definitely won this one. All right, boys. Everybody vote in the poll. Which one do you want? Dang, Chris is winning. It's between Harry and Crixus. Dang. Okay, so Crixus won. Okay, I'm going to go to this one. These are the two setups here that are the last ones to vote on. So, if you guys would like to vote, I'm going to put up the poll right now and the winner will get 100 bucks. So, dude, honestly, it could be any person. It could be either one. You guys think it's going to be Floren? It's 5 to six. Oh, it's 66. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, boys. Floren is the winner. Up is 13. Before I was just gaming on my bed with my laptop. I set up like this cuz I like my setup to be minimalistic and productive. I started saving money since I was eight using birthday and Christmas money. My plan is to save enough to buy a PC. Wow, for 13, bro. The mindset diff, man. Bro, bro is actually kind of sick, man. Look at this for 13 a laptop setup. Pretty awesome. You know what I'm saying? So, I also like that he put his mic arm on his bed and ran the cable down his bed post. Like, you can't even see where the cable is on that. That's actually super clean. I believe this is the underside of his desk. No kill management there. The controllers are on the left side. I'm assuming like the Xbox is in one of the drawers or something like that. This is really, really, really, really cool, man. I'd recommend if you have this kind of desk like to pull the desk off the wall a little bit and put all these cables on the back of this desk because like you've got like a little hidden piece of wood here that you can put all of your cable manager behind and not even see on the floor. It's honestly pretty clean. But I also love the blue and orange theme. I'm seeing this a lot with like younger people's setups. They're really liking this orange and blue kind of theme. Yeah. So overall, I would rate this a 6 out of uh 6 out of 10 or 6.5 out of 10. You did a really good job with like the the lights behind the monitors. You did a good job mounting your your laptop there. You got dual monitors. Um, you know, and it looks really good for 13. This is awesome. All right, moving on. We're going to go on to EMTT. Before it was just one monitor with the same PC, and I had a hand-me-down desk and a Five Below mouse. I like it set up like this cuz I saw other people on YouTube have it like this, and I really liked it. I also saved up for doing extra work, being in extra movies and TV shows. Was my plan in the future to upgrade to a 144 Herz monitor instead of 60, maybe get some LEDs in a clock, etc. His age is 12, by the way. Okay, this is a 12-year-old setup, which is interesting. I mean, this is pretty good for 12 years old. I respect the the Green Day. I respect it. Green Bay Packers, man. Good I respect you. What's the point of the Mountain Dew bottles up here? Like I maybe it's like decoration, but what I would do if if I were you, like if you wanted to make this decoration and it was like a piece you wanted to collect or something, I would fill them up with like water and put dye in them. I love the the aesthetic you're going for. I've never seen an Alex drawer, if I'm being completely honest, chat, I've never seen an Alex drawer in this colorway. Has anybody seen an Alex drawer in this colorway before? I've never seen it. On top of that, I really love this floating shelf here. Overall, this setup is great for 12 years old. There's not really much I can really say. I mean, obviously maybe remounting your power strip on the back of this shore or something up there. I like that you did a raceway there, but having this power strip hanging. And yeah, K man's not awful. I like how you did these single clips for the stuff you needed. Overall, looks really good. I think this is probably a solid seven. I love the aesthetic he's building. Like this wood on white. I really love the aesthetic he's trying to I see what he's going for. Thank you for submitting to the setup, EMTT. This is a great setup. Thank you. We're going to go on to Kyo's setup. Now, Kyo's setup caught my eye. He didn't have any info. Look at this setup, man. Right off the rip, we're we're going hard. This is already an insane build. Holy crap, man. The aesthetic, the lighting, everything is just perfect. like down to a tea. This setup is amazing. So, right dissecting this, right off the rip, he's running this like neon city theme with this pink and blue vibe. And then on top of that, he's got some speakers that are beautifully placed besides a controller, which he has on a little stand. I think that also charges as well. On top of that, he's running a keyboard mouse. I think it's like the model O and maybe an RK61 or a GK61, something like that. On top of that, this PC is beautifully built and it's a very interesting case style. I haven't really seen it anywhere. But what I would say is activate your damn windows. You got this beautiful setup. You don't even have windows activated, man. It's $30. Okay, it's $30, man. That's all it is. Okay, just go just go activate your damn windows. Overall, though, the setup is beautiful. I love the lighting. The way that you built the lighting, everything like that. All of this is beautifully placed. I also think your desk is beautiful, too. Like, it's it looks like a thicker version of an IKEA desk. I don't know how you did that, but yeah. And then on top of that, you got like a headphone hanger that's drilled into the wall, which I think is really a beautiful place as well. nice. I don't sink a single cable in sight. I mean, this is a beautiful setup. Like, I just love the aesthetic and everything else. It's it's it's beautiful. Beautiful setup. So, overall, I'd rate that 9 out of 10. Thank you so much for submitting. And also, K man, it's really solid, too. He's running a uh Sigma and rack as well. I I think it looks really good. Luke is up next. This setup is beautiful. Okay, it's a productivity setup and not all my setups that I I feature on the show have to be a gaming setup, but I really love this setup and that's why I want to submit it. He had a poor he had a basically a bad setup before bad desk, old TV, no laptop, etc. This is why he wanted to pick a good quality setup considering he had a bad one before this. I also heavily invested in a college studying marketing and emphasis on accounting. Um, and this setup gets the job done perfect. My plans in this setup is the future upgrade my MacBook to allow more compatibility with my iPhone and a smoother workflow overall. Just looking at this, this is beautiful, man. I love the aesthetic, bro. Like, this is insane. I love this wood and felt a mouse pad with like the the the coaster as well. He wants to get a MacBook, but he's running an HP laptop instead right now and a little bit of an Xbox for some light gaming. Overall, I love these mini lanes. They come off from the side of the monitor. I think it just adds this extra aesthetic that before you didn't have. And I also like the shelving, too. But overall, this is really, really clean, and I think you've done an insane, insane job. Thank you for submitting, Luke. This is a great setup, dude. Mason is up next. Let me pull up his info here in a second. I always loved having a clean setup, and I wanted to try to build one with the help of my dad. I started out with a laptop on my bed. I took some time to get myself a desk and move on. My parents helped me out for paying for the setup, and I also saved about 3K for my previous birthdays and Christmases to build a PC and an audio setup. My parents got me the rest. My plans are the future to be successful streamer like my boy Gutsy Aiden. I'm not even a successful streamer. Come on, let's be serious. Thank you for the kind words, brother. And this, by the way, is an age 15 setup. This is awesome. Off the rip, I really love the way that you built this setup. For 15, this is already great. You have a really good start. Kale management is beautiful. I love how you have these raceways here. He's also running an artisan with some grips on a G Pro, which I like. Off the rip, I love the setup. I love the aesthetic you're going for, but I think that you have a conflicting color scheme. And this is just my opinion, but you've got purple and blue in most of your setup with the PC lights and stuff, but then your setup is black and white, and then your your keyboard and stuff is black and gray and black and white. If you're going to do that, I would say just move all of these lights to black and white, and your setup would completely fit, and it would all fit smoothly. I think this is a great setup nonetheless. I mean, I love that you have the shelves and the personality. I think you've done a really good job of making everything fit and feel comfortable. On top of that, I I love the hanging plants on both sides. I think you did a really good job with that. On top of that, um, Gill shelf. Nice. We know you like G- Fuel and being energized. And then we got, you know, some pop figures up here. I think for a 15-year-old setup, I'll give it an eight. 8 out of 10. Thank you for submitting. And yeah, moving on. And onto the last setup for this episode. 2 years ago, I never had a laptop or PC. When I finally got myself a laptop, it was faulty and I ended up getting the money back. So, I thought I would try out a full desktop. Ever since then, I have been upgrading my setup, but I just had some other monitors and I paid for my setup using money I had from birthday and Christmases. In the future, I hope I can get a bigger desk. As you can see, my monitors go off the side of the desk. And yeah, I hope that I get a new desk and set up soon. Um, all right. Let's take a look at the setup. Now, I do like how you made this custom sleing for the back of your PC. I think that's dope. The only problem I don't like about that is that your PC fan air flow is going through this. you know, it's exhausting air into that. But I also like they have a keyboard cable that goes into your desk. But yeah, I love this wall behind your setup. I love the background or the wallpapers to your setup as well. I think this is a beautiful wallpaper with what you're building. There's not really much I can tell him, right? Like this the setup is really nice and I love the way that he placed his mic. I think overall it's not awful. I would say this is probably like a I want to go 6 out of 10. Everything is solid in the setup. I think you've done a really good job with the aesthetic and yeah, a 14-year-old student out of Ireland. His main game is Rainbow Six Siege and COD Modern Warfare 2. Previous setup was just a PS4 and a TV. What inspired him to build his current setup is Vermax, Mi, and Tech Source. So, thank you for that. He built a setup for gaming, watching videos, and he built the setup in Christmas 2022. It took him around a year and a half to build it all. He afforded a setup by birthdays, Christmases, and working around the house. So, looking at it, I mean, the pictures aren't the best, so I'm going to go with my gut here and kind of just go with what I have. It's honestly not bad. I think the biggest thing, it's very chill run-of-the-mill setup. And I do like that you've got like the figurines and you're starting to build the personality. Like, I can tell like you like Marvel and uh Spider-Man, then you like, you know, Star Wars and stuff like that. I think the little Lego guy is kind of cute. But yeah, I think overall it's super clean. Kale management is not bad. Could be a little better, but you know what? You did what you could. PC, that graphics card's got to go. I don't know how that thing's alive and how you're running three monitors off that GPU. I don't know how you're doing it. I I just don't. So, yeah, the main thing I would invest in is a new GPU 100%. Overall, the setup's not bad. The personality is decent. Kale manage's decent as well.",
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"And I'd probably rate this a solid 7 out of 10. This is Eric, an 18-year-old out of Kansas. His main game is Apex Legends, and his previous setup was just a corner desk with one monitor and a PS4. What inspired him to build his current setup now is watching esports players play in their setups and the simplicity of Optimum Tech setup. He built this setup for schoolwork, streaming, and GTA with friends. He started building this setup in 2021, did most of it in 2022, and then did the final upgrades in 2023. It took him around 3 years total to build this entire setup. He afforded this setup through earning money by working on his grandmother's farm, working at a dog boarding ranch, and his graduation money. He got the PC with his college account his grandmother set up. Do people actually play like this? There's no shot, right? I mean, cable management's great. The foundation isn't bad. Starford's PC, so Oh, this is the first time I've seen one. Okay, this is definitely a typical Asmin Gold viewer. Look at Bro's keyboard layout. Yeah, bro. That That's crazy. You definitely should buy a rug. I mean, it's not a it's not a bad setup. I think you do need to add more personality. I would honestly take down these foams. They ain't doing So, yeah, I would take them down. I'd put something better on the walls, maybe some more, you know, some more posters, stuff like that. But the monitor is crazy. I mean, me personally, I don't I would never play this way. I think the the mic would have been better. Maybe above the monitor, like right here, like somewhere right here. Put the this further back, and then put it over the top of the monitor. Overall, I'd probably rate this a solid uh a solid five out of 10. Next up is Gabe, a 15-year-old student out of Washington. His main games are Fortnite and Rocket League and his previous setup was just an Xbox and so he's kind of upgraded a lot since then. What inspired him to build his current setup is to play with his brother and he built the setup for his PC. He built the setup in 2023 and it took him around 2 months to build everything here. He also afforded this setup by working hard. Looking at this setup, I mean, it's pretty clean. You know, I actually like the the 18x6 Miami swirl. I think it fits so well in this setup. Nice. A really nice monitor. Also, I I think it's like more of like an esports ready type of setup, you know? Honestly, I really like it. I think the only thing So, one thing that's holding the setup back, I think, is personality. I mean, if you look at the whole setup, I feel like there's not a whole lot going on. I think it's just like very run-of-the-mill, but it's also very clean, too. So, it's not it's not like he did a bad job. It's more like he just needs to add to it, and that'll come with time. But overall, I think the the aesthetic, like the the color you're going for, good. I would keep on this path you're on. Overall, I really like it. the thing. You know, you could mount this power ship. I don't know how big that is, so I don't know if that's even mountable, but I would try to at least clean up the cables a little bit. Maybe go down the leg or something like that and over. But overall, it's not bad. Yeah, he definitely should have uh invested most of the money into the setup stuff like you know um like in the PC, the monitor, the peripherals, like get that exactly where you want and then improve the aesthetics to it as well. Maybe a second monitor could help a monitor mount to the desk. That's one thick ass power break. That's what I'm saying. That thing's probably going to power them on for a week and a half if it goes offline. But um I give this a probably a solid 6.5. I think it I mean it's not like crazy, but it's also really nice. Some mouse pads in the setups in this video are my own company, gutsy.com. So if you like what you see, check out the description down below. And let's get back to the video. Next up is Ralph, a 12-year-old from Virginia. His main game is Fortnite. His previous setup was an old brown desk, a Nintendo Switch, and a small TV, so he's upgraded a lot since then. What inspired to build his current setup is Tech Source, me, and Low. He built the setup for gaming and maybe content Christian in the future. He built the setup for gaming and maybe content creation in the future. He started building the setup in May, and it's taken him around 3 or 4 months now to build this setup. He afforded this setup by doing chores around the house and helping his family. and his dad also helped him build the setup so that he wouldn't break anything in the process. So, looking at the whole setup, I mean, the the wire has got to get some help for sure. It's an Xbox setup, so I didn't really expect much. I was kind of looking for the PC if I'm honest. It's not bad for a console setup. I think the set the desk fits this console setup very well, but if you were to upgrade to a PC, it's probably not going to be you might need a bigger desk if you want to upgrade to your PC cuz like you might be able to fit one here, but it might be like kind of tough. Keyboard and mouse is nice budget one. And the speakers are kind of cool looking. Instead of putting the the power strip here, I would have ran one cable up and then mounted it on the bottom of the desk instead instead of here. And yeah, overall it's not bad. Um, I just think it needs a little bit more organization of cables. So, looking at this though, I mean, the personality is there. Like a lot of figurines across the whole desk and setup. Uh, plants there, you know, a lot of aesthetic there. The clock on the wall with the little Spider-Man guy. Yeah, I'd rate it probably a solid I'm going to go solid six. Actually, I'm going to go a solid six out of 10. This is Raphael, a 13-year-old out of Montreal, Canada, and his main games are CS:GO and Forza Horizon 5. His previous setup was just a PS4, so it looks like he's upgraded a lot since then already. What inspired him to build his current setup is me and Tech Source. He built the setup for gaming and to live his passions. He started building this setup at the very beginning of Corona virus. Damn, long time ago. This setup took him around 2 years to finalize his dream setup. He afforded this gaming setup with his party money and the money he makes by cutting grass. And who helped him build this setup is his dad. Oo, coming off of a coming off of a like a low-key setup to a banger. Look at that. Okay, I do actually like the aesthetic of having like things that you do on the walls. I've seen a lot of people who like, you know, like this is really chill to me. I think this is cool. In my opinion, I really like the aesthetic he's going for, like kind of encapsulating the monitors with the the skateboards and then, you know, the bonsai tree over here. here. I think that's cool with the light and the mic placement's good. Good personality. Yeah, you got a little race sim below when he wants to use it. That's pretty cool, too. Casey looks clean. I think that's really really dope. And the whole room looks like a vibe. It looks like a vibe, dude. The little bing bag in in the in the corner. I think it's actually not bad. And then also, I like how like you kind of scattered the personality throughout. I think you did a great job with your aesthetic and what you're going for. Kale management's not bad. Also, I would have recommended maybe putting a raceway in front of this. Um, but looking at the setup on the front, I love how you did like the little light bar up top. Solid. I would say this is like a solid eight. Next up is TJ, a 15-year-old out of New York. His main games are Valerant and Fortnite, and he's a student, and he also plays basketball. His previous setup was a really tacky and cluttered setup, and now it's getting better. And who inspired him to build his current setup is his brother, which is really cool, I think. He started building the setup around 2 to 3 years ago, and it's taken him around 6 months to a year to build it all now. And he afforded this setup by working a job and also his parents helped him from time to time. Take a look. [Music] I mean, hey, there's a lot of personality. It's not necessarily in the setup. It's more It's more in the room. Like you can see in the far top right corner, like there's a bunch of album covers and stuff like that that he maybe drew or made. Then he's got like shoes and I'm assuming there's a shelf more on the other side of the room. But the room looks really really clean from this angle. Also, I think you did a great job with like just making it a really solid foundation. Two monitors, PC, keyboard, mouse, controller if you need it, speaker if you need it, you know, very run-of-the-mill, really clean, very chill. Also, I like that. I saw I saw the $100 bill rug on the bottom, dude. Um, and this is his PC. It's a little outdated for sure. I don't know if this is supposed to be Oh, no. It's a 1660 Ti. Uh, going back to the setup though, I think it's dope. I think you did a great job. Really love the setup. Midi Mason setup. Okay. Okay. 15 years old from Texas. Already an amazing setup for 15. He streams on YouTube and he's a high school student. That's great as well. Love the peripherals here. His main game is Fortnite. That's awesome. I love everything in the setup so far. His old setup was just a Chromebook. That's kind of a comeup though. I can't even lie. That's a come-up. Inspiration for his setup is to never stop or settle. That's cool. I love this room, dude. Just the room in general. The lights coming down the wall, the goi lights up here, the aesthetic, the panels, the lighting in between. All of that's amazing. He gets his earnings from YouTube and creator code revenue. Dang. Okay. He bought a setup from creator code revenue on Fortnite. He started building my setup in June 2020. Okay. So, he's went from 2020 to now. So, he started building this when he was 13. So, basically content and live streaming is what he uses it for. But looking at the setup, I love everything. I mean, from the cable management to the usefulness of every single part of the desk he's used on. Everything is in it has its place. It's beautiful looking. like just like the cable management as well is managed very well. I just love like the whole aesthetic. I think personally this is like a nine or a 9.5 out of 10. I really enjoy the aesthetic of this. I think the aesthetic is what sets it up for me. And then not to mention all how clean his cable management is. It's great. This is Archie's setup. I love this already. He's 15 years old from England. Man, a lot of 15year-olds in the setup in the setup video. Holy. He makes tech talk content. Okay. His main game is Call of Duty and this PC looks insane. Also love the keyboard. Love the accents as well. Various setups on TikTok inspired him to build his. He's a setup for gaming, editing, and graphic design. Really, really talented kid. Um, he got his first setup in 2017, and he's been upgrading it since. He built a setup using birthday money and work. He built a setup with some help from his dad. Okay, understandable. You're 15. I love this aesthetic looking at it like this. I love the double stack here. I think he did a great job with this kind of vibe here. I also love the GOI Glide and the Nano Leaves up the side. I think it adds a really nice aesthetic. Also like you got, you know, dual chargers for both mice. I think that's kind of elite. And then I also love your PC aesthetic. The keyboard mouse combo. I love how it's like I think this is maybe a 75. Kind of similar to mine. Got the afro. Love the accents. Love the the mouse too. If I were looking at it just by itself, I would probably rate this like an eight. But knowing that he has cable management and everything as well, like cable management is kind of bad in the setup. Uh, I'd probably go like a 7.5. But yeah. Oh, yeah. But I love this setup. I love the aesthetics. I think the only thing that needs to be better is his cable management. The next setup is by Ryan. Okay. He's 17-year-old from Texas. Okay. He's a CFA manager. I don't even know what that means. Um, his previous setup was just an Xbox and a single monitor, so he's kind of on the come up. He's got a PC now. Um, he built a setup from editing pictures plus videos for school and gaming. Cool. That's cool. Cool job. Photography work and video work is awesome. I built his first PC in June 2022. Okay. So, he's kind of been upgrading since 2022. That's awesome. So, I love the personality in the room as well. He's inspired by seeing amazing setups online and wanted to replicate it. Awesome. Uh, he built the setup using uh the money working as a CFA. I've been slowly building this setup since I built my PC. So, he probably built his PC in June and then he's been upgrading over time. So, looking at the setup as a whole, I think you did a great job with the aesthetic. The only thing I would say is maybe move this PC a little further back. If you need longer cables, then, you know, extend those cables. But yeah, I also love the pegboard on the left side. I didn't talk much about this, but I like how you stored everything here. Like how you did like everything in the different jars and you started hanging up stuff. I think that's really cool. Also, you know, since he's a subscriber on YouTube, he's definitely a winner. You can see first place right there. So, if you subscribe on YouTube, you're a winner. Um, but yeah, also the cable management looks pretty good for what you got. Also, love the backgrounds, too. I think he did a great job with that as well. I would probably rate this like a like an eight, honestly. It's actually really well put together. The next setup is by Braden. Uh, he's from Vermont. Sheesh. He currently mows lawns. Okay. His main games are 5M and Rust. Uh, his old setup was just an Xbox and a monitor, so he's on the come up here. I built a setup around a year ago. I would say that the leg room is not enough in my opinion. His mom and his dad helped me build this setup. Okay, cool. Um, took about 3 hours to build it all in total. I planned on upgrading the PC specs in the future. Okay. Yeah, definitely needed. The one thing I'd really say about this setup is you don't really have much leg room, but I honestly would have went legs instead of Alexro here just because you don't have a lot of room. I would just say also go for a 60% to kind of save some more room, but I definitely think taking the Alex short out, putting two more legs and everything would be the goal here just because again like your PC. Overall, not a bad setup. I'd probably rate it a 6 out of 10. All right, moving on to the next one. Sicilian. I hope I said your name right. This Sicilian setup. They are 13 years old from Dublin, Ireland. Really clean. All right, let's take a look. The main game is War Zone 2. Okay. He built the setup a year ago, a year and a half ago during COVID. Okay. W The room looks insanely nice. Uh setup took about 6 months to build. Okay. W um his old setup was a PS4 and an old monitor, so he's kind of upgraded a lot from there. Uh he built the setup using his birthday and Christmas money, which is cool. So, he's kind of upgraded during birthdays, Christmases, and stuff. That's awesome. And then his dad helped him build the entire setup, which I really like this space bar, by the way. It's really cool on this keyboard. I mainly use my setup for school and gaming. So, um yeah, the one thing I noticed right off of the rip was there was no mouse pad, right? Um just because I run a mouse pad business, you know, like that's the first thing I noticed. I don't know if this applies to everybody, but for some reason, that's like the first thing I noticed when I walk into a setup. I think mouse pad number one, you got to get a mouse pad. Two, I would say to mount this monitor on the wall since the stand has a really round like it's really round. Um, and it kind of like blocks off your keyboard more. I'd say if you can mount this to the wall, I would mount it to the wall. PC and the Lee uh mini. Love it. Love this AIO. The way you built it in here, the black and white aesthetic. Very, very clean. Uh, you did a great job building your PC. On top of that, I love the room and the shelves and everything and the aesthetic you got going on. Look really good. For 13, this is an insane setup. Love the painted wall behind the monitor. I think it adds so much more than you think. Cable management is great as well. I also love how you did headphone hangers here on the right for both your headphones. Really clean. Keyboard and mouse combo really solid as well. I love this setup. I think it's it's really really clean. Like just the room, the aesthetic, everything. So, I would probably rate it an 8 out of 10. All right. The next setup is by Scoop. He's 25 years old from England. Okay. Okay. Um he's an active duty Air Force. Oh, that's cool. Um, he mainly uses a setup for streaming and editing. So, thank you for your service as well. That's awesome that he streams and everything. That's pretty cool. Uh, he has a dual PC setup for streaming. Okay. All right. Love to see it. I started building my setup September 2020. Dude, I love how you have the dual mouse pad. This is cool, bro. Uh, it took about 2 and 1/2 years to build it all. That's really cool. Uh, I was inspired by Gutsy, Matty K, and Tech Source. Awesome. Um, he'd like to get a fourth monitor um and upgrade his lighting a little bit more. Such an insane setup. So much personality. The double mouse pad with the keyboard tray that matches the desk is wild. That's such a unique thing I've never seen anybody do. The mini a mini version of my mouse pad of the same one and bought the same. That's so sick. In my opinion, the only thing I would say for this is the cable management for sure. You know, it could be a little better. I also love all the personality in the background. The Lego Thor, the Lego Hogwarts, the the fridge, all the paintings on the wall, everything. Like this is just a really nice like aesthetically pleasing setup for sure. So I'd probably rate it a 9.5 out of 10. I I really love the aesthetic and you get another point for me using both mouse pads. I think that's so sick. The next one is by Scott. Scott is a 9-year-old out of Scotland. Okay. Okay. These are a setup for watching YouTube and Discord. We're getting a lot of 9-year-old setups now. His old setup was a laptop and was super ugly. Okay. So, he's kind of like upgraded since then. Uh he started building a setup in December 2022. He built a setup using his birthday money. That's pretty That's a That's a W. His parents helped me build most of it. That's cool. I love the aesthetic, man. So, there's not a whole lot to the setup, honestly. It looks really solid for what you have. Looks like a You got a pre-built there for a 9-year-old setup. Pretty freaking clean. Say probably a I'd probably say a seven. Yeah, it's probably good. But yeah, I love this setup. I think it looks really clean and the aesthetics really nice for, you know, 9 years old. This is Michael's setup. I think this is the last setup of the day. I'm 15 years old from Tarnell, Poland. Okay. He's in middle school and he plays COD and Valor as his main game. Um, his old setup was an Xbox One S and a TV. Okay, that's kind of a huge update though. Um, he started building his setup uh in the 2020 during COVID. Okay, that's kind of a W. Um, he's inspired by Gutsy and Hexors. I used my setup mainly for school and gaming. Okay. He built a setup by doing chores and birthday money. Okay. But yeah, it looks pretty clean. I love the the shelves, the the all the boxes you're using, the Lego Baby Yoda. Um, all the personality there as well. Kale management, honestly, pretty solid. Gaming PC could use some work. Intel stock fan could use some work for sure. Also love the wallpapers and all the foam you put around it. I think it adds such a nice like aesthetic as well. I think personally I'd probably rate it I'm going to go an eight. No, I'm going to go a seven. Seven out of 10. So, this is Jasper setup. We've seen Jester before, but he's made some additions that he's wanted to show us. So, he's 15 years old and he's from Norway. He bought his setup using his birthday money, which is dope, and from selling crabs. Interesting. It's taken him three years to get to the setup where he wants it now. And he plays on a PS4 and a couch is what he used to play on. And it looks like he's upgraded a lot. He started building his setup in December 2019 and decided to redo the whole setup in June 2021. And I think he's redone it again since then. He's inspired by me and Tech Source, which is awesome, and Fallen Fo's old white setup, which is dope as well. He has a Logitech Gro Super Light and then a GK61 XS which I think a new keycap set is needed. He mainly built the setup by himself. He had uh some help assembling the desk which just kind of needed for any setup to be honest. I built the setup for content, entertainment, and gaming. I know Jasper does do content. Looking at the setup though, Jasper, like just like the whole room, the vibe, everything. Like it just looks really insane. I love the blue and white vibe that you've got going on here. Um and you've been building this so much so much better every time I see it. You know, you've done a really good job with the personality. So chat, what do we rate this out of 10? What are we thinking out of 10 here? 11 out of 10. 9 out of 10. Decent nine. Like like I said, this setup, not just like the setup itself, but the whole room is nice. Like I love like this like fake window. I think that's so cool. I'd rate this uh I'd rate this 9 out of 10. It's It's like perfect though. Like I'd even rate it probably 9.9. Like the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I want you to submit more cuz I want to see you keep inv uh inventing. So let's move on to the next setup here. This is Ben. Okay. Sheesh. Uh, he's 12 years old and he's from Wales. He mainly makes videos and plays Valerant. Okay, cool. That's a W. Uh, Low and Gutsy Aiden inspired my setup. Hey, thank you, brother. Much love. He has a Logitech uh super light and then he also has a 70% keyboard here. His old setup was an Xbox and a terrible desk with a TV. He built a setup using his pocket money. Okay, bros been saving up. Uh, he built a setup to have the space that brings him joy. Lit. That's That's awesome, man. I feel like that's like the best part about building a setup. Okay, so looking at the setup, I mean, it's honestly pretty clean. I'd say the only I wish I would have seen more pictures of the room on top of that. You know, your PC is really fine. I think I think it's really well spec, so that's always good. I would have liked to see more of the room here just to to see more of it, but I really do love the purple and white aesthetic you've got going on. I think it really adds like a really nice vibe to the setups. Uh, overall, I'd probably rate this a 8 out of 10. I really love just like the aesthetic, the, you know, everything you got going on. I I really like it. Uh, this is Gage. Okay, so Gage's setup's looking awesome off the rip. Um, he's 13 years old and he's from Texas. He does e-commerce, baking, and making content. My main games are Fortnite and Overwatch. Okay. Okay. His old setup had a single monitor and an Xbox, so he's kind of upgraded a lot since then. He started building a setup in 2020 after watching the video. Thank you, brother. He has a ducky 12 mini and an asjazz mouse. I hope I said that right. He has a Fifine K60 688 mic and a road boom arm, it looks like. No. Oh, it's a Fifi boom arm. Damn, it looks like the road PSA 1, like the the road boom arm. Uh, he uses it for making content. Cool. His setups took about 3 years to build. So, he was 10 when he started building it. Interesting. And it was inspired by me and Tech Source, which is awesome. I'm glad to see that he built most of his setup by himself. Love to see the innovation there. And then his dad helped him build the desk, which is cool. He plans on upgrading his PC case and mouse. Okay. And then, yeah, I mean, I love this setup. I think for 13 years old, this is a beautiful setup. I love how you did the panels behind here. I love the PC case, the monitor, all of that. I think you did a great job. I love also that you didn't put the tabletop all the way over to put your PC on there. I think it was very smart that you spaced it to where your PC would fit on the Alex shore, but then also your desk would fit on there. I think that's very, very good. And then, yeah, I really like how you put the plants on both sides, speakers up there. Like, I've never seen anybody do the speakers like that, which is good cuz it's kind of like off your setup, you know? So, his goals are uh I like how it's like a whiteboard with his goals on it. 10K on YouTube. Nice. I'd probably rate this like an 8 out of 10 in my opinion. So, this is Ethan's setup. Okay. Okay. We're getting somewhere here. He is 16 years old out of California. Awesome. He details exotic cars and resells shoes. Is that what he said? Yeah. Okay. Uh I use my setup for school photography and gaming. Awesome. My old setup has two monitors and a TV. Okay. So, now he's kind of like what went to three set uh three monitors and stuff like that. Uh he's inspired by Gutsy and wanted to change my room. Hey, I appreciate that, brother. Uh he built a setup in September 2022 and he's been upgrading since. It looks like he has a Razer keyboard and a Viper wireless mouse. Uh he wants to get a smaller keyboard so it isn't as cluttered. I agree. You should. Um and he built and paid for the setup himself. This one's awesome. Yo. Uh he's been working at a detail shop and that's kind of how he afforded his setup and it's taken him about 3 years to get the perfect layout of everything he wants. Okay, let's take a look at this. Wow, dude. Just like I love this setup like from the everything on here like like the way that the monitors are lined up and everything. You should fix this panel. I also like how he built like a like a sneaker rack behind his setup. I think this wall just adds like such a unique vibe to the setup. And I just love that he he added like, you know, all these shoes that he liked cuz he liked sneakers and stuff like that. It's part of his um his like vibe to his setup. So, I really do love that. I love the mirror, too. I think the mirror adds a lot more depth to the setup, you know? I'd rate this an 8 out of 10. 8.5 or 9 out of 10. I really love the cable management. The cable management is what really really gets me. You took the time to do your cables. Um you took the time to cable manage. He took the time to make the setup look actually nice. Everything else is is really really solid. But yeah, like I said, very very great. Think you did a great job. Thank you for submitting. All right. This is Ilas. Oh, okay. He's 15 years old out of Germany. Okay. Okay. I use a setup for school and Valerant Fortnite as well. Uh he bought his setup using birthday money and reselling, I'm assuming, reselling shoes or something. Uh his first setup was a PS4 and a small TV. So he's kind of upgraded a lot here. Um he built the setup primarily for gaming. Awesome. And then he built the entire setup by himself. Uh, he was inspired by Gutsy Tech Source and Blima. I never heard of that person, but thank you. He plans to upgrade his graphics card. Okay. Okay. So, he's a 13-year-old out of Germany. Okay. Or 15-year-old. Sorry. I really do like the vibe of the setup. The only thing I don't like is the monitor layout, but I guess monitor layouts are more personable. Um, I think he did a great job with the lighting behind the pegboard. I think the pegboards could have been scooted a little bit closer. But yeah, I I I like how simple it is. Overall, like the whole room itself is really clean. I would say this is probably a solid seven. It's really good around the basics, but I feel like there's a lot of things that are missing. Um, so yeah. All right. This is uh Talon. Talon's setup is next. Oh my gosh, this looks amazing. Um, they are 9 years old out of Texas. Okay, there's no way. There's absolutely zero way that this is a 9-year-old. There's no way this is a 9-year-old. No shot. I use my setup for content creation and gaming. Bro, there's no way this is a 9-year-old, bro. There's no way this is a 9-year-old. Uh, my main games are Fortnite and Valerant. Okay, I bought my setup using my Xmmith money and yard work. Bro's parents own everything, bro. That's crazy. The mouse pad's dope. Uh, my old setup was a Nintendo Switch and an iPad. Okay, so he was an iPad kid. They started building a setup in August 2022, so last year. So, he was eight when he started building this. Holy bro. I had the idea for 2 years and it took a month to build. Damn. 9 years old, bro. There's got there's got to be cap going on, right? There's got to be cap going on. But that but if this kid is actually 9 years old, that is insane. That that there's got to be cap going on. He's got to be like 10 or like 11. But still, like or this is like his dad's setup or something, right? Like maybe this is his dad's setup and he submitted it as his like but we'll have to do it as a submission is right for for a 9-year-old setup. I mean, this is pretty freaking insane. Like, you don't need anything else in your setup literally at all. Um, this is awesome, man. Thank you so much for submitting. This is a crazy setup for 9 years old. Wow. All right, the next setup is Logan. He's 13 years old from Kent, Washington. Um, he mainly plays Valerant. Okay, I see you love the key caps. He recently got a new mouse pad. We got one, boys. We got somebody that got a mouse pad. W. Um, uh, he plans on fixing his cable management. Okay, but I really do love the um the wallpapers, the vibe you've got going on. Keyboard and mouse combo is great as well. Um, I'm not sure what keyboard this is, but it's really clean. Love the coiled cable as well. Also love like just love the shelf, the lighting, like the everything. It's just really good. I would probably say like an 8.5. Um, so thank you so much for submitting. I really do appreciate it, Logan. Let's get on to the next setup here. Uh, the next one is Craig. Okay. Okay, we're getting somewhere a little bit. Okay. A 17-year-old student from Scotland. Okay. I mainly played Rocket League, which is his main game, and he's been building the setup for over 6 years. Okay, cool. Love the PC. He's inspired by Tech Source's setup wars. Okay, W. I can see it. The Tech Source mouse pad as well. My first setup was just in the a TV and an Xbox. That's crazy. That's kind of what mine was, too. Uh, he recently finished his new setup February 2023. And then I love how he did this left side, too. Um, he used this setup for gaming content and streaming. Love the Astro stand there. He's able to build it with money from birthdays, Xmisses, and his job. Um, he built the entire setup with the help of his dad, which is cool. I love the cable management. Yeah, like I love this room. This is beautiful. Not a cable in sight. I love how, you know, you've got the plants, the controllers on the side in a nice place. You got the symmetry with the plants on both sides. He plans on mounting the PC and getting a third monitor. Okay, cool. Yeah, I would say it's probably a nine. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is there's just not enough personality for me. But everything else is great. Jumar Jumar, he is 32. His occupation is a private driver. He is located in Abu Dhabi and his main game is Valerant. His previous setup was just a normal laptop setup. And what inspired him to build his current setup is he's seen a lot of setup videos on YouTube. He built a setup for just gaming and watching YouTube. Plain and simple as that. He built a setup in June of 2022. It took him about two months or so to build his setup. He forded it by his salaried making, you know, being a private driver. And on top of that, he just built him set his setup himself. And he doesn't have any future plans to upgrade it. He just loves his uh he just loves his setup the way it is. Let's go ahead and check it out. Right off the rip, we have this really cool pink and blue and white aesthetic that we've got going on with some, you know, the black accent, stuff like that. Chair looks massive. I think it's just because of the picture. But overall, we just already off the bat, this cable management is on a whole another level. I mean, look at this. He's got the USB hub here. He's got two penci",
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So, we're rocking a one one monitor ultrawide setup. I love this view already, though. Wow, what a view. That's nice looking. There's Oh, and this is the set the uh laptop setup he was saying that he wanted to upgrade. Okay, this line on the wall. I don't know how you did this, but it looks so nice. Um, also his cable management's great underneath. We got the cable ties underneath, mounted to the bottom of the desk. And all the cables are mounted there, as well as a little hub here for his mouse plugins and, you know, SD cards and whatever. Looks amazing. Everything fits well and and just the aesthetic of this wall with the the paintings and stuff like that. Incredible job. For a 14-year-old setup, this is really clean. So, I would definitely say that this is a solid seven. I would give this beautiful setup. I love the view. I love the ultra wide. I love the wall and the way you did this. aesthetically pleasing. It's great and thank you for submitting, man. The next person up is Daniel. He is 14 right off the rip. Amazing color scheme. Pops like crazy. He is a student out of England. His main game is Valerant. And his old setup was previously just his mom's old Mac. And what inspired him to build his current setup is he started watching a lot of YouTube videos about gaming PCs and stuff like that, including my amazing content, which that is what he actually said. Thank you. He built his setup back in August of 2022, which only was only like a month ago. He got all his money from doing jobs uh and reselling stuff on eBay and some birthday money. I'd love to look into your setup, man. I love this aesthetic already. So, let's go take a look. So, I love this wall, even though like it seems kind of like like old art like this. It just great for a budget setup, like you called it in the in the the notes. This is beautiful. I love the way that the lights are diffused on the desk. I like the monitor, the aesthetic from the pink and blues. They really pop. On top of that, your cable management is just like really great. I also love the way that you built this desk and the time the space you used it in. I don't really have much to say about it. I love the aesthetic. I love the way it looks. And yeah, there's not really much advice I would give. Looks awesome. So, we're going to go ahead and move on to the next setup. We're going to go on to Alias. Alas is a 14-year-old out of Norway. He's in school, so he doesn't have an occupation. His main game is Valerant, and his previous setup was a stack vertical setup, which I've never seen. When inspired to build your current setup, I wanted a clean setup where I can get some natural light. And what did you build your setup for? My gaming uh for game with my friends and have a little place where I could escape everything. He started building a setup back in 2018 and now it took about 4 years to get to where he's at now. How did you afford your setup? Helping helping at a home for my or at my grand family. His future plans for the setup is he wants to get a third monitor again, but I'm holding myself to this layout and I'm probably getting some more plants for this setup. Off the rip, we've got this beautiful blue on white colorway for the entire setup. The way that he set up his monitors, the lighting, the shelving, all of this is this is great so far. Keyboard, mouse combo, Gro super light, and a regular keyboard. But this PC looks good, too. Overall, this aesthetic and the way he built this for 14 years old, this is beautiful. The aesthetic is great. I love how the plant comes down with the monitor. I love the shelf. The way you showed some of your personality up there, man, it's beautiful. From what I see right here, I would say it's probably a solid seven 7.5. Yeah, looks great. Thank you so much for submitting. Let's go on to the next setup. Okay, the first this is Juan. He is 13 years old and he goes to school. Obviously, his main game is Apex Legends and he's from the United States. His previous setup was a Nintendo Switch and just a monitor. What inspired him to build his current setup is Setup Wars. um 6 months ago he started his building the setup and it honestly took him about 20 days to keep upgrading. He afforded his setup by saving up and doing some side hustles and his uncle helped build his setup with him and his future plans for his setup is to upgrade it to where he has more upgrades for the physical parts of his setup like monitors PC. Love the I love the aesthetic we're going for this pink and blue. I'm seeing this a lot between people's setups recently. I like the pink and blue and I love this lighting in this setup. up. I think it like lights up pretty nice. But the desk orientation is interesting. Like you've got your PC to the left, right? And you have your monitor on this right side. This lighting behind the shelf looks great somehow. I don't know how you did this, but that looks great. Also like that the top of the setup is pink and I like the bottom setup blue. I think it gives this really interesting aspect to the depth of the setup and that's cool. And then his cable management is decent for the most part. It's like he mounted he made an attempt. He's 13. This is a beautiful setup for 13. For 13 years old, I would probably say this is a seven out of 7.5 out of 10. I really like this setup. I think for 13 years old, I love the aesthetic you've got going with it. So, moving on to the next setup. This is Leo. He's got a nature themed setup, which chat, I think you guys will like this one. This one is Leo's setup. He is 15 years old and he's a student in Italy. His main game is Rocket League, and his previous setup was very, very minimal with a taxi themed setup. So, it was like yellow and stuff like that. before upgrading this uh the setup in the summer. He had a yellow themed setup and he didn't have a TV, but he stacked a monitor layout and he recently upgraded to the LG C2, which he loves it. What inspired him to build his current setup is he built a setup with his friends and schoolwork. He found out about setup related videos on YouTube and ever since he's been binging them and wanting to upgrade his own setup. He used the setup for photo editing and video editing as well and some school work and some light gaming as well. He built the setup over the summer and it took about 3 to four months to get his setup exactly how he wanted it. In total though, it took him about three years to just get everything that he has in his setup. He afforded his setup by saving up and as well he's planning to get a better audio setup as well. All right, Kill Mansion looking awesome. Looking beautiful already. This is looking sick, man. These these pictures, dude. These are beautiful pictures. So, off the rip, I just love this setup. it from the lighting to the plants to the way that he set this up. The aesthetic absolutely stunning. I love the wall grain like the the way that this looks on the wall. The shelves match the desk exactly. It showcases his talent in video editing and and photography. He's got some of his lenses, stuff like that. This is amazing. It just gives this shock value. I I would rate this probably a 9.5 out of 10. Thank you so much for submitting this, Leo. This is Landon's setup. So, this is Landon. He lives in New York. Okay, let's see. His main games are Fortnite and um previous setup wars was clean. So, the whole goal of this chat is to guess uh who like what age he is. This is a very clean it's a very clean setup though. The age is going to is going to be hard to guess. Two days to build this entire setup. That's it. Dang. Summer jobs. Okay, so he said summer jobs here. Summer jobs and flipping old setups and cars. So, he can drive. He works summer jobs, so this means he's like a teen still. Let's see. I my Wait, final final guess. I'm locking in 16. I'm locking in 16. That's it. Dang, bro. I was wrong, bro. Oh my god. I love this setup, by the way. Uh not just guessing the age, man. I love the attention to detail on top of like your personality from anime to Baby Yoda to just like the attention to detail on everything. Also love the keyboard and mouse combo, bro. Love it. Love to see it. Only advice I'd say is the RGB is a little close to the wall and I understand you were trying to hide some of the cables, but yeah, that's just my opinion. Um, from the white HyperX uh mic to all of this peripherals and supporting the mouse pads. Thank you. Like, man, this is a crazy setup, dude. Props to you, bro. Props to you for real. Jesus, dude. This is a really nice setup, dude. Holy, I love it. All right, the next one is Jamie's setup. Now Jamie, I think is out of England. Okay, cool. Cod and FIFA are the main games. W previous setup was awful. Pretty much everybody else's. Love the personality already. Oh man. Okay. Till 2022, 6 to 12 months to build. Okay. Long time. I'm thinking younger. Saving up my money. parting. Buying parts every week or month. Okay. I don't know, chat. What are we thinking? Hey, wait. He subscribed. Make this number go up, bro. It He's probably like 15 or 16. At most 16. I'm going to say 15. 28. 28. Okay, dude. Okay, brother. To be fair, it is very clean. Like from the from the figures and the the amount of spacing and like everything else matching the pictures with the figures is kind of cool. I think that's one of the coolest things though. All right. Sansson. He lives in Canada. Okay. MacBook Air setup. Little productivity setup. Johnspire. His friends inspired him to build the setup. Okay. Interesting. Gaming in school. Interesting. Gaming on a Mac. H interesting. Gaming on a Mac is really interesting. Saving up birthday money giveaway. If they they say birthday money, they are like like at least 14. Parents help me build a setup because they funded money for it. Yeah. Planning getting a PC in the future. I'm guessing 134. My guess is 134. I'm guessing. No. No. Final lock in guess 13. Let's go, bro. Let's go. I just know as soon as you say birthday money, it's over. You're under 15. His desk isn't awful. Really good slate to work on. I love how minimal. So, let's look at let's look a little bit deeper into his setup. I mean, like the walls are because behind this I think people aren't realizing that this isn't a wall. This is a window. So, he can't mount things, right? You could do a desk mount which could make it a little bit more clean. Um, but I'd love to see a picture of the window open. Yeah, overall it's a pretty nice setup for a 13-year-old. Okay, this is Jay's setup. Okay, let's take a look at Jay's setup. So, he works at a golf course in Kentucky. Okay, cool. Oh, dude, I already love this setup a lot. This reminds me of Lowe's setup a lot. Cool. Um, let's take a look, though. I mean, KO management solid. Um, man, KO managed solid. Built a setup in 2020 and wanted to keep building it. Okay, cool. Still working on it. Cool. What are we thinking? He built nearly all of it. Okay, planning on changing. Oh, wait. There's a build. Wait, we have a picture of him. We can kind of tell off of this. Um, I think he's 17 for sure. [Music] Okay, dude. I This is what I'm saying, dude. He There's something in the water, bro. There's something in the water. There's something in the water or the milk or the food you guys are eating that is making you y'all look buff as hell. Um, but overall, the setup is really nice. And, you know, thank you for supporting me and Logan at the time. Um, looks really great though. Love the setup. Love the aesthetic you're going for. Uh, you did a great job with everything. Cable manager is pretty decent, too. Only one cable coming down. All right, moving on to the next setup here. This is Chris's setup. I mean, honestly, this is going to be really hard to guess. He plays Fortnite and Roblox. Oh no. Damn, that's a Oh my god. What is going on here? Two years to build this. Okay. saving up for Christmas, birthdays, and working. Oh man, this is a tough one. This is a really tough one. He plays Roblox and Fortnite though. My guess is 15. Like my guess is actually like like 14 15. That's my guess. I'm locking it in. Dude, I'm so good at this. I'm so good. I'm telling you, I'm so good at this. I love what you did with the light though in this right side of having the light kind of like match around your um your posters and stuff like that. I think it's really cool and interesting. The only thing I would say is just reorganizing the setup when you get a new desk, right? When you said that's what you wanted would really help out the setup a lot just because like overall like setup's nice, but it's just like maybe a little bit reorganization could really help out the setup. 15, man. Great setup for 15-year-old, bro. For real. I think this might be the last one. This is Justin setup. Uh, high school student. Okay. High school student. Giveaway. Ding, ding, ding. Okay. Create setup with a Nintendo Switch. Okay. Let's see. 2021 for school gaming and content creation. He's in high school. Okay. So, he can't be younger than 13. What do they set up by saving for Chris's birthdays of walking dogs? I I want to say I want to say 15. I want to say 15 or 16. I'm going to lock Okay, I'm locking in at 16. I know 15 is probably the better answer, but I'm locking at 16. Come on. Can't be in high. You cannot be in high school and be 12. You cannot be in high school and have No, you cannot be 12 and in high school. Um, overall, I would probably say the one thing that holds this setup back is personality and and like actual things that you could collect. Um, yeah, 12-year-old's crazy. That's insane. Same setup versus a 12-year-old, but I mean, you know, there's not really much to say about it besides just like, you know, double monitor setup. Overall, looks really insane, bro. I think this is a great setup. The next one is Tim. He is 13 years old out of New York and his occupation is school and trading stocks. His main game is Call of Duty and his previous setup was just kind of bad, so he wanted to upgrade it. What inspired him to build his current setup is moving to York and wanting to have a nice setup. And he combined these two things. He built a setup for gaming and productivity. And he built this setup about a month ago. It took him about 1 month to and uh a week to get everything exactly how he wanted it. Um, he afforded a setup uh when he bought a lot of GrubHub stock during the COVID and it skyrocketed, making me enough money to sell off the stock and buy the setup. Now, that's insane. I can't lie, that's kind of cool. The only future plan he has is to buy a Gutsy Aiden mouse pad. So, I really appreciate that. So cool. That's awesome that he sold stocks to get this set up. That's cool. I I was really excited to see this cuz like you could see like underneath his desk is floating in the air, you know? So, I was like, that's really cool. So, I would really recommend to try to space some stuff out or like rearrange the room a little bit so you could make out more room. But I would love to see like an ultra wide and then you just have a nice ass view. Look, it probably looks insane during the morning. But I love that you have this white, black, and wood theme going on, which I would love to see more of. I just want to see an ultra wide setup that is very clean and minimal. But overall, really clean and I think you've done a great job. I really love that it's on a high-rise setup and I love your story as well that you sold the stocks to get your PC and your setup. So, I think that's really cool. I'm impressed. I'm impressed. What do you guys think? Nine 10 out of 10. E13. Yes. This video is sponsored by gutsyen.com, my own mouse pad company. Some of the setups in this video use our mouse pads. So, if you like what you see, use the link down in the description to get one for yourself. Now, back to the video. This is Drew. He is 13 years old and his occupation is a Roblox dev and mowing lawns. He's located in Texas and his main game is Rainbow Six Siege, COD, Fortnite, Roblox, Forza, and Madden 23. His previous setup was just an HP office laptop and a $5 mouse, which obviously this is a huge upgrade since then. His main inspirations to build the setup is me, TechSource, and Casp, which is dope. Um, he built a setup for gaming/schoolwork, and he built the setup in 2022. It took him about 2 years to build this entire setup. Uh his future plans to build um his setup is to order a brand new CPU, motherboard, and a liquid cooler. So, yeah, this is super cool. At 13, this is pretty insane. So, this is really, really clean. Let's take a look through the setup. I mean, I love the the orientation of the monitors. I think that's super cool. The the PC case is awesome as well. I've never seen like dots like this with a light. That's so cool. I've never seen that in some sort of case like this. And then here's the cable management. I would have liked to see a little bit more organization. I love that you uh mounted your power strip, but I would have liked to see like a actual raceway with this organized. But overall though, love the theme and aesthetic. I love that you put the wall panels up and the lighting on the wall panels looked actually really solid. 8.5. I agree. Um so this is Blake's setup. He is 14 years old out of Australia. His main game is Russ. What inspired him to build his current gaming setup is me and Tech Source. So I appreciate that. Um, he built a setup for gaming and he built the setup in January 1st this year. So, dang, this is pretty new. It took him about five years to save up and also build the setup and then he afforded his setup by saving up money he found on the ground and what he saved up for Christmases and birthdays for 5 years. Dang. Money he found on the ground, bro. Bro must have found like thousands of dollars on the ground or something. That's crazy. His next upgrades is he wants a larger mouse pad and a webcam to start streaming for for 14 years old. This is really great. I'm already looking at this going, ""This is nice."" On top of that, I love like the wood with these white peripherals. I think it's great. Thank you for the mouse order, by the way. But I do love how the blank wall and the lighting behind the monitor gives this really nice glow, and it makes the setup look really great. These white peripherals with the with the the natural light coming in. I love it. I also like the hints of blue, too. I think this is great. I also like Yeah, the case looks really clean, too. I think that's literally the same PC case as my gaming PC. I think that's the NZXT H5 Flow. Love the peripherals. Um I love how, you know, he's kind of turned them to blue, white, and kept the aesthetic throughout the whole setup. And I love the hints of wood, too. Yeah, I could use some under desk glow. I agree. That chair is on live support, though, bro. Jesus, dude. That chair is falling apart. I think overall, I would rate this an 8 out of 10. This is Aliyah. I think that's how you say her name. She is 14 years old. Her occupation is drop shipping. Uh they are located out of Israel and their main game is Minecraft and Beaman Drive. Uh what inspired her to build her current setup is Tech Source. They built their gaming setup for gaming and work. They built their setup in 2021 and it took them about 2 years to build their entire setup. They afforded their setup by saving money and saving money and also my parents money to buy certain things for me and they did it themselves. That's awesome. So let's take a look at the setup. I mean already off the bat, this is looking super clean. I love the uh the PC as well. I love how much RGB is in the PC. The peripheral is looking super nice as well. Cable management's looking really tidy under here as well. I like how each cable is kind of like where it's going is uh you know cable tied which is really well really well done there. The PC is one of the coolest things I've seen though. I don't know what these RGB cubes are like a rectangles or what are they what are they called? I don't even know what you call these but it makes the PC look insane. Very minimal. Um, I would have liked to see the lights diffused on the bottom there or just like on the bottom of the desk instead. Like I'm I'm really impressed with the color scheme. I really like it. Overall, I love the setup. I think it's a great solid foundation. 7. Yeah, I I would say this is a solid seven. Albi, he is 15 years old out of England and his main games are Fortnite and Rocket League. Uh, his previous setup was pretty bad, he says. And what inspired him to build his current setup is everyone on TikTok. So, he built a setup for gaming and school work. and he built the setup over about a month ago. Um, it took him about three weeks to build the whole thing and he afforded his setup by Christmases, birthdays, and working around his house. Who helped him build the setup and why? And no one really helped him out to build the setup. He did it on his own and he wanted a clean space for himself. Let's take a look. Here's his PC looking like a little rough there. Looking like a little budget build here. Not too bad. For the most part, this is a really solid build right here. I love the skylight right above your setup. I think that adds so much nice lighting into your room, like into your setup. Everything else though, I love the color theme and the idea you're going for. I love the skylight. I think there could be so many cool things you could do with this. Overall though, what do you guys think about the setup? I like the pegboard on the left. I wish you would have showed more of the room so I could see, but I love the painted wall with the white. I think it makes the setup pop. I would love to see more cable management, but and a little bit more personality put throughout the setup. But I love this skylight. I think it adds so much personality. Super super cool. Yeah, I I could probably rate it like a solid six. The next setup is Trevor. Now, he is 19 years old and he's a salesman out of North Carolina. His main game is Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Scary Games on Steam. His previous setup was just a coffee table table and he used to sit on the ground and play the keyboard and mouse on his knees, which is that's kind of crazy. I used to do that, too. Uh what inspired him to build his current setup is YouTubers like me, Casp, and Slush. and he's built the setup for gaming and entertainment. He built the setup in October 2022 and it took him about overall four years to save up and build this entire setup. The monitors and stuff like that kind of a unique layout. Double ultra wides up on one up top, one curved on the bottom. It's really uh it's really interesting. I've never seen someone really pull it off very well, but it it overall though it's not a bad setup. I just think it needs more reorganization with the cable management, with the orientation of the monitors, stuff like that. Color scheme is there. Yeah, it's probably like a six. He's 14 and he's from the UK. His main game is Fortnite. He was on Xbox One and an old TV before this and now he saved up for a PC and he afforded this by mowing his neighbor's lawns for a year and a half. Uh here's his main stuff he uses and he plans to get a high to mid-range PC in the future and sort out my cable management. So, looking at the setup, I mean, it's a laptop setup for sure. I do like how you set up the laptop here. I think this is very unique for sure. Having the monitor on the side and then the main monitor is better because it's like better hertz or whatever. This is pretty good, but the cable management is really really bad. On top of that, this desk is a little scary. Like look at how you're balancing this. Like and then over here it's like way in the front. Like it's just thrown together. And like I definitely would say to get a new countertop or try to fix this and make it look a little less like that. It's funny that you spent money on the nail lease when you need a PC, you know? I feel like those are expensive. Like I feel like those are things that come after unless you were gifted it. But yeah, interesting enough. I mean, the keyboard and mouse combo is not terrible. Completely honest, I'll give it like a solid 4 and a half. I think the only thing that sets this setup apart from others is the way you mounted this monitors. Like the way you did your laptop and your monitors, but everything else just needs work. So, I'd recommend I'd recommend doing that. This is Astro setup. He's a 15-year-old Twitch streamer that also plays soccer in a local academy. He's from Sweden. Uh his main game is Sea of Thieves, Fortnite, Minecraft, and he built the setup to play video games, study, and have fun with his friends. It took him around 3 years to save up uh working at his dad's place to reach the goal. He built everything by himself except for the shelves that my dad helped me build, and he used to play Xbox One S for 4 years until he switched and he wanted to spice up some stuff. I really like the aesthetic you're going for. I like that you put the Gobi Glide above the shelves. I like how you put the plants like kind of hiding the shells and stuff like that. Also really like um the the PS5 controller stand. I think that's really cool. Gaming PC, if I'm completely honest, I know you put on the floor cuz you thought you didn't have enough room, but I think it would have looked better right here on the desk. Am I tripping to think that? But oh, why does it go like that? Um but I think it would have looked better on the desk right there. Um looking at your modders and stuff, really nice. I like the lighting around the room, too. Really clean. Kill mansion's okay. I mean, it's got a it's got a tray on its own, so it's not a huge deal. But yeah, I think this PC on the desk would actually look pretty good. Maybe I'm tripping on that, but I think it would look good there. And I think you should also mount get a Vivo mount and mount your your monitor. That way, it's like floating. Um, and then you won't have these bubbles in your in your mouse pad, you know? I think personalitywise, it's a solid seven. Setup itself-wise, I feel like there's a few things it could organize, but overall, this is really solid. I I get, you know what, I'll give it I'll give it a 7.5. This is Remedy setup. He's a 13-year-old that is from Florida. He makes cool YouTube videos and FPS games, and survival games. Interesting. His main his main games he plays is Valerant, Minecraft, Rust, Call of Duty, Black Ops 1. Um, he built a setup to have nice time with his friends, cousins, and play video games. Okay. It took him around 3 to four years to get everything after he got the laptop, and he's been adding to it since. Here are some of the things he uses in his setup. And he afforded this setup by collecting money for birthdays, chores, and getting stuff for Christmas. Dad and his brother helped him build this setup. And yeah, so looking at the setup, I wish I would have seen more around the room. I'm being completely honest with you. Yeah, I would, if I, if I'm being completely honest, I feel like there's a lot of stuff you can do with this setup. I think you need monitor mounts for sure. I think you need a bigger desk if possible, like a thicker desk, not just like this carbon fiber one. And then I also recommend maybe putting your drawing tablet somewhere else. problem is you have this drawing pal tablet on the desk and it's not really useful. You should make a thing where you just pull out the cable and you plug it in when you need it. Also, cable management is kind of bad. I would recommend some raceways as well. The drawing tablet's cool. I just think you need some more room and you don't have not a lot of setup room to do this. Also, um I think the mic placement's really bad as well. Um I'd recommend a boom arm if you can, but there's zero personality in this to be fair. What do you guys think chat? Four out of 10. A lot of people were saying four out of 10. I'm going to I'm going to give it a solid like there's really not a whole lot to go off of and I feel bad, but I would probably give him I'd probably give him a solid I'm going to go a solid four. This is Drake. He's 13 and he got inspired by you and techours to build the setup. He uses a setup for school work gaming and he plays Fortnite, Call of Duty, Rocket League, and Valerant. And he raised money through Christmas money and his dad helped him build the setup. Love the prove them wrong sticker. Sheesh. Dude, he's got the He's got 34 out of 50, dude. Dude. Yo. Yo. See, this is an OG viewer of mine for sure. Cuz I did this. If you are a newer viewer to me, that's okay. But I did this in 2021. I went up to the warehouse and I signed like uh 50 mouse pads and I and I made them a gold colorway. And that we've never released any of them ever again. It's a it's literally one of a kind. Like there's there's literally and they're numbered. I like the theme a lot. I think the only thing you could really improve on here is just more personality in the setup. But you're already doing such a good job here with like the shelves and the lights and the the the hoops right here. And then your KO management scene's pretty decent from what I can tell. Extra points for being an OG. For real. I the hey the streets are saying it's a 10, but in my opinion, I I think it's like a solid eight. This is Frank. He's a 19-year-old uh college student from Puerto Rico. His main games are Valerant and Minecraft. And he built the setup for gaming, studying, and the first time he submitted his setup was a year ago in episode 19. And now I'm here and upgraded with my setup, which took me a whole year and 2 months to build. And he got his first PC 8 months ago. Okay, awesome. Yeah, but look at this, man. I mean, this is beautiful. I like the double monitor setup. KO management is actually really nice. Really solid foundation. Love how you cable managed behind the PC as well. Yeah, really nice cable management. I agree. Mic placement's good, too. Monitor placement's decent. Mouse pad room's great. Ho man's very good. So, in my opinion, I think the only thing that this lacks is personality in the room itself. And that's totally okay because like I said earlier, he built this whole setup and he's got a really solid foundation. So, once you have the foundation, you can start to like sprinkle in the sauce. You know what I mean? If you don't have the foundation, there's like levels to it. If you don't have the foundation, you're not going to be able to build the empire. You know what I mean? Overall, I would rate this a solid seven out of 10. I really do enjoy it. I think it has a really solid foundation, but I do think at thinks it's a little higher, but I think it's like seven. It could use some more personality for sure. This is Sam. He's a 13-year-old from Canada. Still a student, but he acquired his setup through progressing, adding in the two years of building the setup from either birthdays or Christmas gifts. That's how he's kind of acquired everything in the setup. Used to play games like Valerant uh or more in my years. Sadly, have stopped though due to boredom and tiredness. Okay, buddy. bro's tired uh for he's kind of just built the setup uh as creatively as he can and he always makes he always wants to improve and make new ideas. He wanted to build a setup to relax and enjoy his time. Example, watching anime or movies and he did everything by himself. Here are some of the things he uses in his setup. And let's take a look at the images. You know what's crazy about this though? It's so minimal and it's nice. Wait, I really like the idea of being able to play on one side and then just move it and watch something and like lean back, you know? I really like that idea cuz like you can see like here he can put it off to the side and like watch something and lean back in his chair. I think that's pretty cool. Really really chill setup for 13. I mean this is really nice. Most setups you see at 13, you know, they have like kind of everything everywhere. They don't have it organized, but this is like minimal, functional, nice. It's not over the top. The only thing I would really recommend is like more personality throughout the room probably. But this is really chill. Also w demon slayer. Yeah, I can't really think of what I could build more what more I could give you for advice. I couldn't tell you really to get a second monitor because you like to move it around. I would recommend a second monitor in the future. I would give this a solid six out of 10 or 7 out of 10. I think this is the Jin. The Jin. Such hard names to pr",
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"His future plans are just to get a bigger mouse pad and that is pretty much it. This 10-year-old has a better gaming setup than you do. I love the blue color scheme. PC looking like it's on hardwood floor. Perfect. Cable management seems like it's okay. You know, he's got some posters in his room. He's got a controller holder over there. It seems like on the left side of his setup, he's got a pegboard and some things that he likes. You know, Red uh Red Bull and Monster looks like a HyperX keyboard and Glorious Model O. It looks like this is such a really nice setup for 10 years old. I like I'm very impressed just because of his age and like what he's built at this age. Like my age at at 10, I didn't even have a setup, bro. I had a little $7 IKEA table that had like a big ass TV and I played on an Xbox 360. That's what I had at 10. This is Sasha setup. They are 12 years old and their occupation is gaming and school and they are located out of England, London. Their main game is Minecraft and their previous setup was an M1 MacBook and two Dell monitors attached to it. When inspired their to build their current setup is Tech Source and Gutsy Aiden, so I appreciate that. They built their setup for 50% gaming and 45% watching YouTube and 5% school work. They built their setup in starting in August 2022 and got it to this point at December 2022. They afforded their setup for saving up about a year, sold my M1 MacBook for my uh to my mom, did chores, helped around the house, saved some birthday money, and also got the 3070 Ti for Christmas. They built the entire setup by themselves. And their future plans are to get a 4070 or 4080 for my next PC and get one of your mouse pads and also maybe a third a third monitor and an Elgato Low Pro mic arm. Thank you. I mean, I love the PC off of the bat. Love this all white build. Looks like it's in the H5 Glow, the same case I built in. So, I love um how you organize the consoles. I think this is great. I think this is a GMK Pro as well. Looks really clean. And the cable management has these raceways which look really nice. love that. I think it's a flexi spot desk, right? The stons meter, I like that. I think it's really clean. Like the light bar above it, I love it. And also like, you know, your mic arm when you get that will be really helpful as well. But overall, I'd give it like an 8.5. I love the aesthetic. I love like where you're headed with the setup. This is Julian. He is 15 years old. His occupation is school, and he's located out of Germany. His main game is Spider-Man, Star Wars Battlefront 2, and a little bit of Valerant. His previous setup was just an Xbox One and a TV and he was tired of it. So he wanted a double monitor setup and this summer he built it. What inspired him to build his current setup is me and uh Tech Source and some of his friends as well. He built this setup for gaming and school work and he built it summer of this year. So 2022. Uh it took him about a few hours to actually build the setup, but he been he's been starting to build his setup in 2018 from a Nintendo Switch to an old TV that he had with it from his uncle and he's been upgrading it since. So that's pretty cool. 1070 and ASUS B5 B450F Thermaltch RGB case. So that's cool. He afforded his setup by saving up for birthdays and Christmases. His future plans for the setup is to upgrade his desk and uh he really wants to save up the money to have one of my mouse pads. So I really do appreciate that. I love this aesthetic he's building like with the brick wall and then like the lights and stuff. I think it's really unique, but I really love the vibe you're starting to build with the setup. And then you have like a like a gaming setup here. And I I like the position of this. This is a really good organization. Uh the setup could use a little bit more work, you know, maybe some monitor mounts, putting the PC on the floor to have more room, maybe a mic arm as well. I think it's probably an eight though. I think it's probably an eight. The boy tech, uh he is his name is Josh and he's 11 years old. Uh his occupation is school and he's located out of England. Uh his main game is Call of Duty and Arc and his previous setup was no KO management and a different PC with only two monitors. He built the setup for gaming and he built the setup in 2019 and he slowly upgraded it over time. It took him about 4 years to completely build this entire setup Ryzen 5 3600 oh 1660 Ti perfect and the Lean Lee 01 dynamic. He afforded a setup by saving up by birthdays and Christmases and who helped him build a setup which is pretty much himself because he knows a lot about tech. His future plans is to cable manage cable manage the setup just a little bit more than it already is. Let's take a look. I love the shelf with the personality. I love the anime and then also like the Nanise. I think it looks really clean with the shelf. Um I also love the two monitors and the the desk as well. I think he's done a great job with that kind of design, organized setup, and I feel like the only thing that kind of holds it back is the PC, which is not a huge deal. He's 11 years old. Thank you for supporting the mouse pads, too. I do appreciate that. For the setup portion, I would give him a 7.5. All right, moving on to the next setup. This is Benji. He's 11 years old. We got a lot of youngans in this in this uh episode. His occupation is school and gaming, and he's located out of Australia. His main game is Modern Warfare 2 and Valerant. And his previous setup was a TV in the living room of a PS4. What inspired him to build his current setup now is Tech Source and Gutsy Aiden. So, thank you. And what built his setup now is for gaming and school. He built this in February of 2021, and it took him about a year and 3 months to build his setup. He afforded a setup by birthday money and also a lot of work over time. His future plans for the setup is to mount all three monitors on a monitor arm and also clean up the cable management and maybe a little bit more accessories for the setup. I love I love like the Galaxy projector in the room. This is a keyboard mouse combo. Overall, I really like the the three monitor setup. I think it did a great job. I love the I love the color scheme, but I feel like you should try to match that with mouse pads and and peripherals and stuff over time. I would probably say it's like a 6.5. Smitty, 15 years old from Texas. He mainly uses a setup for content creation and streaming. His old setup had a Chromebook and used a phone and PS4 for gaming. Inspiration to build a setup was to grow and invest in my brand. He started building this setup around 5 months ago. It's taking him around 5 months to build it all. He built a setup from content and his Epic Games creator code. Oh, chat. How many of you guys actually use a creator code of a creator? Cuz that's crazy. I didn't know someone could afford an entire setup from Epic Games like themselves. I didn't know they made that much money. But this is a huge setup. This is dope. I'm loving the ultrawide to match all of this. I love all the cameras. I think you did a really good job with like placement for everything. Also, I love the theme. You know, you got the PS4 on one side, the the PC on the other that's built really nice. I probably say this is like a solid nine in my opinion. I think you did a really good job. I mean, just looking at the photos, the lighting, the personality in every spot. I feel like in every corner of the room there's something, you know, and I feel like that's a good thing, and it's not like overly cluttered. I think this turned out awesome. The next setup is by Amari Topal. He's a 13-year-old from New York City. Mainly uses a setup for gaming and homework. He started building this setup in March of 2023. It's taken him around 5 years to make this setup possible. He's inspired to build this setup as he wanted a good setup to use. He built a setup on his own with a little bit help from his dad. He built the setup using his money from working with his dad's. I like to prove them wrong sticker as well. So, just looking at the whole room, I mean, looks like kind of a basement setup because in basements you have like a little tiny window he put curtains on. That's the only thing that I don't like in this setup to be honest. It just looks so weird. But it's just because of a New York like house type of thing. Like a lot of it's a it's a common thing. Overall, the aesthetic of the setup is really clean. Monitor layout's awesome. Mouse pad's great. Stick to the white and black theme very well with a hint of wood. The wood isn't too bright either, which kind of matches the black PC and the different personality things around his setup. You know, the paintings and stuff. I would have liked to see more on this right wall like on the right of his setup. I would have liked to see more, you know, personality shelves, things that make him him kind of things. Overall, I'd probably rate this a solid I'm going to go with like a solid eight out of 10. The direction you're going in right now is good. I just think you need to add a few more things like on the right side of the room and I think it will uh it'll balance itself out. Really good setup for 13, man. So, let's look on to the next one by Joe Kim. 13 years old from Norway. Mainly uses a setup for gaming. The old setup was a laptop setup and with an IKEA desk and a single monitor. And he started building this setup around 2 years ago. Took them till December 2022 to build it all. And I built the setup with some help from her brother and the PC. I built the setup by reselling PCs and as well some help from my mom. So looking at the whole setup, I mean just looking at it here, I mean this is beautiful. Just really solid, you know, plants in the middle to hide the gap. I've never really seen anybody do that, so that's that's awesome. Usually it's like a camera or something. Also, I love the light bar and what kind of light it brings onto the keyboard and mouse because it just adds such an ambient like clean aesthetic to it, which I really like. But yeah, looking at the cable manager too, not a single cable really in sight besides one power cable. Really clean. Awesome. Awesome setup for 13. I mean, this is a beautiful setup. People are saying out of eight out of 10, 7 out of 10, 8.5 out of 10. I mean, this is a beautiful setup regardless. I mean, this is this is really nice. Yeah, overall beautiful setup. Thank you for submitting. Whoa. Okay, Estebon, I think I said your name right. Estan, he's an 18-year-old from Montreal, Quebec. He mainly uses the setup for gaming school and photo editing. He's inspired to build a setup by Gutsy Aiden, Tech Source, and Tik Tok. He started building his setup in summer of 2022. Took him around two months to put it all together. He built the setup using his money from his working at working at IKEA and side hustle. I mean, just looking at this entire room. Beautiful setup. Like just everything is balanced. It looks nice. It's has a ton of personality. I mean, this is a beautiful setup, chat. I mean, look at the look at the shelves on the left side. Everything is just like immaculate, you know, like showing 2K. He likes 2K. There's like different um pop figurines of things he likes. The whole shelf matches in the setup. The black here and the black there. And then the wall has like grass on it with like a really clean like little a neon sign. Cable management obviously isn't the most insane cable management, right? But it's cable managed enough to like not see a cable and it just has such a unique vibe to it. I think this is a 10 in my opinion. Beautiful coloring, man. Such a beautiful setup. Thank you for submitting a skilled. I hope you said your name right. He's a 12-year-old from Norway. He mainly uses a setup for music production and gaming. His old setup had a old gaming laptop that he didn't have any RGB. Started building this setup in December 2021. It took him around 1 year to put it all together. He was inspired to build this setup by Gutsy aid and a tech source. He built it by using money from Christmas and birthdays. He built it mostly by himself and from his dad. Looking at the setup, the one thing I noticed was the cable management. This thing needs absolute cable management and reorganization. I see the potential for sure of this setup. I just don't like the cable management in my opinion. I think that he could use a lot more of it. I mean, from this angle, it looks decent underneath, but then on the right side, you have all these cables here. I really I think that the cable management needs to be reorganized. I think a lot of chat is saying that as well. It's not bad, but it does need a lot of work. So, in my opinion, put the PC on the floor, reorganize all the cables, maybe get a bigger raceway. Personally, I would rate this a five out of 10. I think he maybe needs to get a bigger desk, more cable management, putting the PC on the floor, maybe adding a way to implement his music stuff without making it too harsh on the setup itself. But yeah, overall, I would say it's like a five in my opinion, but thank you for submitting. Next up is Cameron. He's a 16-year-old out of Houston. I mainly use a setup for streaming and content creation. He started building his setup in 2017. He finished building this version around 3 weeks ago. He's inspired to build this minimal setup with while maintaining a personality. He was able to afford a setup through content creation on Tik Tok, but he built the setup mostly on his own while implementing inspiration from Tik Tok. See, I like the setup a lot. I think it's so minimal. I would have liked to see more personality on the walls. I know Etch as a person, so I know he's a very minimal person. This minimal setup works great for him. I also like where he put his camera because like if he wants to do top down shots, he has top down shots. If he wants to put it on himself, he can. So, it's kind of a nice area to put his camera up here. And if he wants to stream with it, he could just move it over and then he's got a stream camera. So, I definitely think that that's like a really solid way of putting your your camera. But yeah, overall really solid setup, man. Overall, I I I think the PC is built well. I think the desk is built well. It's built for what you need it for, and it's very clean. So, I would have liked to see a little bit more personality. Like I said, really solid setup. Chat, what would we rate this out of 10? 8 out of 10. Cuz there's too much stuff on the right would make it which makes it non-symmetrical. H. It's not that it's not symmetrical. It's more that it's just doesn't have personality on the wall. And I don't think he's going for symmetry here. I think he's going for minimalism, which isn't a humongous deal. And I I like that the camera's there, too. But overall, really solid setup. Thank you for submitting, Etch. Moving on to Limong. LiFong, the 14-year-old out of Hong Kong. I built this setup and as well, he wanted to have space that he couldn't already enjoy. Uh, his main game is CS:GO. He started building a setup in September of 2020. It took him around 3 months to put it all together. and he built this setup by saving up with his own money. So, looking at this setup, I mean, just how beautiful the single monitor setup is is amazing. I love this side of the setup. I love that there's like one setup that's really clean on the left side and then there's another setup that's clean on the right side. Has two monitors, one wanted an ultra wide, one wanted a double monitor. I also love that there's like a speaker so they could both like listen to music while they're playing. All of this is beautiful harmony. I think that the setup works great. I think that might be a bunk bed above them or something. But this is such a beautiful setup with the lighting, um, the clean looks, the cable management, the PCs, like everything fits together and I think you did a wonderful job. And in my opinion, I'd rate this like a 9.5 out of 10. The.5 being gone because there's just not any personality to the setup. And yes, personality matters and probably would have been a whole point, but chat really likes the setup and I think the cable management's decent enough. I mean, obviously, I would have liked to see it a little bit more like close to the desk, but you can't even see it on that side, so it's not a humongous deal. But I really like this setup and I think you did a wonderful job, too. Moving on to the next setup. This is Jason's setup. He's a 17-year-old from the United States as mainly uses a setup for streaming, gaming, and school work. I recently put the setup together. Okay. He's been upgrading and improving his setup since 2018. He's inspired to build a setup by Gutsy Aiden and Tech Source. He worked for it and paid for his setup 100% on his own. But looking at this, I mean, it's really, really nice. I mean, I think the whole thing with this is that that the PC's on the left side and everything's just squished into the right side. I think he should put the PC maybe on its own thing on the right side, center the monitors with the desk, and then move all the figurines like around and maybe get some shelves. I just think it's super cluttered and there's really not a lot of room for how many monitors he has. I mean, this is a beautiful setup. I think I think it's really clean. I would have liked to see just a little bit more of the setup, to be honest, but it's honestly pretty solid. I think you should definitely reorganize it. But next setup is by Javier. Javier is a 16-year-old from Minnesota. Mainly uses his gaming setup for school and gaming. He started building his setup a year ago, but recently upgraded it. It took around a month to put it all together the way he has it now. He was inspired to build it by TechSource. He paid for the setup and by saving it as well as working at Party City. He also built it and put it all together 100% on his own. But looking at this setup, I mean, I love how the setup is laid out. This is like an example of someone who knows like how to organize a setup to where it doesn't feel cluttered. Also, I think it's also he got a house buff here because the house has this ledge where you don't even really have to put shelves on it and it stays off the desk. So, he put like his his personality stuff on this mini shelf for the main setup. He knew that he didn't have enough room on the right side. So, what he did is he put the PC on the floor and, you know, put something to where he could store it down there and it doesn't take up a lot of room of the setup itself, which that's a really smart decision by him. Also, I think he did a really good job with the monitor layout. It doesn't seem too cluttered. It's really clean. Also, I think he added enough personality to where it's not overly over the top or anything like that. And I do love how like he did in the past have this PC here, but I think this like an older picture. So, I think the newest setup, the way he did it here, looks the best in my opinion. This is a really nice setup. 10 out of 10 in my opinion. I I think I really love the personality. I think he did a great job. So, thank you for submitting. The next setup is by Flavio. He's a 17-year-old from Switzerland. He mainly uses the setup for studying and gaming. He started building the setup in summer of 2020. Took him around 2.5 years to build it all to where it's at now. He was inspired to build it by Tech Source and Gutsy Aiden. He built a setup by saving up and working with his own money. So, looking at this entire setup, I mean, it's a beautiful setup. There's just something weird to it about it to me. I don't think anybody from chat's going to realize this, but the setup on the bottom half before we get to the shelves, right? The bottom side is nice cuz it's got wood, black, and it keeps this wood and black theme, but then you have glass and glass and silver. And this doesn't go well at all with the setup in my opinion. I mean, yeah, the silver kind of matches these, but the glass just doesn't really match for me. The personality is there 100%. I just think the glass just seems a little off. But overall, it's really solid. In my opinion, I think it's probably a solid I'm going to go I'm going to go with this one being a solid like eight out of 10 probably. I think the setup is really solid personalitywise. I think there's just like simple things that he could change. It's not a bad setup. It's really solid. The next setup is by Charlie. He's a 16-year-old from England. Mainly uses a setup for gaming and content creation. I started building a setup in October of 2022. It took him around 1 week to put it all together. His old setup was super bad, crammed, and now he's got it pretty much spread out. He was inspired to build his new setup by moving to a new house. He paid for his setup by saving up money and selling old PC parts. Looking at this entire setup, there's a lot to unpack. I mean, double PC setup. I'm assuming this is maybe like a friend or a girlfriend type of setup. Maybe. I'm assuming a brother or a sister or something cuz he said he was kind of younger. So, I don't think there would be like a girlfriend like being here all the time. But looking at the entire setup, I mean, this is beautiful. I love the plants on the wall and adding the double setup like this is beautiful. I think it it it's really nice that it matches. Looking at this PC is beautiful. I love the how the GPU mount kind of diagonally shows the GPU. I think that's really unique and I haven't seen that. Also like that he has the specs on this mini screen for us. It looks like a 3070 and Intel Core i7. I just like that he put this on here as well. It's It's really nice. And overall, I mean, double setup and it being somewhat organized is actually nice. I think he did a great job with this. I'd probably rate this like a solid I'm going to go with a solid nine. I really like that it's a dual setup. I really like that he did a great job with adding personality and also making it fit. Yeah, it's a solid nine in my opinion. Thank you for submitting. Next one is Joelle. He's a 14-year-old from Germany. He mainly uses a setup for gaming, streaming, and content. Started building this setup in April 2022. It took him around 3 to four days to put it all together. He was inspired to build it by Tech Source and Gutsy Aiden. He paid for the setup by saving Christmas and birthday money. So, looking at this entire setup, I mean, I like that the desk is just super long. You know, it feels like it fits perfectly. I love the monitor layout. I think it's good as well. One single monitor, two monitors on both sides. PC fits well. the dog bed underneath. The lighting where these 3D art panels are kind of pushed off the wall, so it adds a little bit more lighting I think is great. Also, the cloud ceiling is kind of nice. I think it's really cool. In my opinion, I would rate this like a solid I rate this a solid 8 out of 10. It's really clean. It just lacks a little personality for me in the actual setup. I mean, in the room, it actually has a decent amount of personality, but I just would have liked to see more in the setup itself. It seems just like very plain. Oh, yeah. Maybe if he doesn't want to, that's up to him, but I I think it's like a solid seven or eight somewhere in there. The next setup is by Lucas. He's a 13-year-old from Washington State. He mainly uses a setup for gaming, streaming, and school work. His old setup had an Xbox and a TV. He started building a setup in mid 2021. It took him around 2 years to build it all. I was inspired to build this setup by Tech Source and Gutsy Aiden. He paid for his setup by working on a farm and chores. Man, I love this color theme. I think he's doing a great job with his age and also building this setup at your age is really nice. Three monitor setup PC at your age I had nothing. So, you know, this is a beautiful setup. There are some things that I would maybe change is the the soundbar. I would love to see like a tiny shelf above the main monitor for the soundbar or below this is mounted, you know, cuz on the desk it seems like it just takes up a lot of room for no reason. Like if you want to if you that's like your only way of listening to sound, I would recommend maybe mounting it or something like that. Um, if you can't mount it, then I would just leave it. But I just I don't know. It just seems like it's really out of place for me. And then the PC itself, I almost think like it's a solid PC, but I feel like your desk doesn't have enough room for it. So, I would recommend maybe getting like an Alexor on the far right or maybe just clearing out the bottom of your desk and just putting it underneath. I in my opinion, I would probably rate this a solid seven. I'm going to go with a seven. I mean, it could be like maybe a six in most people's opinion, but I think it'll probably be a solid seven. Yeah, solid seven in my opinion. Looks really good. Moving on to the next setup here. The next setup is by Luca. He's a 15-year-old from New Zealand. He mainly uses a setup for gaming and streaming. His old setup had an Xbox One and a TV. He started building the setup in December 2022 and it took him around 2 to three days to put it all together. And he built this setup by working at McDonald's and doing newspapers. He built mostly everything by himself with some help from his dad. So, looking at this setup, I mean, this is a beautiful setup. I just love how clean it is. I think it's everything is is really nice and then there's like a random just like old ass fan. It's like really it's like kind of cursed in a way. It's a really nice setup, but then you just got this like random fan there. And then like the personality of the room, I feel like if you decorated the walls some more, like the painted wall looks good, but I think like if you painted the walls a little bit more, you know, you kind of went around with all that, it would look a lot better, too. Yeah. Chat, what would you rate this out of 10? I'm not sure where this is. Like for Yeah. See, like look, it kind of looks like like an outhouse or something or like an office. Overall, I would probably rate this like a solid six or no, no, no. I'd probably rate this like a solid 8 out of 10. Uh, with everything in it, I think he did a great job. Um, like see there's keys there on the far right or the far left, too. So, overall, this looks insane. I love the the Thermaltch PC. I think this is probably the best thing in the setup in my opinion with the wall painted, too. It looks really clean with this PC. This is this is dope, though. Really, really clean. So, let's go ahead and move on. Let's go on to the next setup. But, thank you for submitting. looks great. This is a Yan. He's a 15-year-old out of New Jersey. Mainly, this is a setup for gaming and school work and streaming. His old setup had an Xbox One with a TV as well and a keyboard and mouse. He started building his setup in the summer of 2022. Took him around 1 month to build it all and he was inspired to build his setup by me and other tech creators. He built his setup by doing chores and saving birthday and Christmas monies. So, looking at the setup, I love the monitor layout. I think he did a great job with the ultra wide and then a monitor up top. The SC monitor looks good. Good positioning there. Looking at the entire setup, I think that I would have liked to see a raceway underneath the monitor just to have it chill and and make it a little bit more clean, but you did at least bring the cables together and everything. And then also the plants on the left side. I would have liked to see a little bit more plants on this side. Maybe like a a tall plant or something just because you got like a lot of plants on this left side and like maybe like one or two on this side just to balance it out a little bit more. Overall, I'd probably give this a solid I'm gonna give it an eight out of 10. I think this is a beautiful setup. I think he's got a lot potential. And I think over time you'll be able to build build more and more. Cable management though needs some work, buddy. Your cable management needs some work. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Maybe I need to lower my score a little bit. We didn't see the cable management, but overall, I I think the cable management needs some work. Thank you for submitting. The next one is by Wyatt. He's a 16-year-old from Minnesota. He mainly uses the setup for gaming and content. He started building the setup in 2020 and it took him around 3 years to put it all together. So looking at this, I mean just wow. This is a beautiful setup. I mean just looking at the room itself, how much personalities in it. I mean yes, there could be a little bit more things about the person, but how clean this is. It's awesome. I would have liked to see a bigger desk cuz you have four monitors, right? When you have four monitors, you have to have a bigger desk in this, especially if your monitor is going over the desk, right? The light strip through the panels. I think you did a great job routing that. I don't even know how you did that, but that's cool. And then also the PC on the shelf, I really like this idea. I've always thought about doing this, but putting a PC on a shelf. Some of my PCs are mad heavy, so I thought it would be like such a hard thing to do cuz it it just looks super heavy on its own. But yeah, looking at the setup, I definitely think like you need a bigger desk. Maybe taking up like from here from this door to this door and make it like, you know, perfectly in between. It would just add so much symmetry to your setup and you'd be able to have all those monitors in the same spot and you could maybe center it just a tad more. But the room itself looks so nice. I think you did a great job with the whole room. Overall, really solid setup. Thank you so much for submitting and I would rate this a probably a solid 8.5 out of 10. I really like the aesthetics that you're building with the setup and for how young you are. I mean, such a nice setup. Age 19. I said I wasn't upgrading pretty much from the ground up. I started with a very cheap PC back in 2016 and I've been selling and upgrading parts one by one over time. I started with one cheap monitor and a cheap desk with the bare minimum peripherals. I arranged my setup like this because it allows me to have not only a vertical screen, but also have a second horizontal screen as well. It helps with reading chat, Discord, and any multimedia on the top screen. I fored the setup by getting my money through my birthdays and Christmas parts and selling other things to upgrade at a lower cost. All right, let's take a look at your setup. Off the rip, I really like this this aesthetic you're going for. Overall, I love the aesthetic. I love this wallpaper you've got going. this blue and white theme with this cyan blue. I think it's beautiful. Rocking the uh the low swirl mouse pad. And then on top of that, we got uh G Pro and a keyboard as well. Yeah, it's awesome, man. The one recommendation off the rip I would say is this setup with the cable management. I feel like you're making them tidy, per se, but I feel like overall it doesn't really fit this desk because you can see it all from like if you're standing or like you're looking back. So, to make this less seen, raceways and maybe making the cables a little tighter to the desk might help. Overall though, it looks really good. I think I think you've done a really good job with the aesthetic and making the top of the desk look good. The aesthetic is great. Mic placement's great. I'm going to say 6.5. Moving on from Adam setup. This is AI setup or Al's setup. At first, my setup was a college dorm desk, one monitor, and a pre-built and a custom keyboard. I was limited to the amount of space I could put my desk in, but I didn't have that much room for creativity. I promised myself one day that I have enough money to build my own setup, no matter the cost. And I've always wanted to build a setup like this. I saw in the YouTube videos and the gaming setup reviews, and I strive to accomplish it. I worked all summer to uh and almost maxed out my credit card to build everything I wanted in this setup. After college, I planned on streaming until my career really takes off. I really told that I could be a very great personality and a great streamer in the future. Thank you, man, for submitting. And let's go ahead and take a look at your setup. Looking at this right off the rip, I really lov",
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm loving this stacked monitor setup here with the nice personality and the leaves on the side. I also love how you have a bunch of cool space here and you've done a great job with like the space you have. I love that you've got like things you like on the shelves and I like that you have like a bunch of personality and then you have a keyboard building station on this side. Everything else just looks so nice and I love the aesthetic you're building. Uh I love your PC. It looks really nice. So it looks so sick, man. Great job. So if I'm honest, I'd rate this an 8 out of 10 or a n 8.5 out of 10. I love this man. Looks so nice. All right, we're moving on to someone that is in shot. This is Etchie's setup. Etchie is 16 years old. He's a content creator out of Houston. His main game is Overwatch 2, and his old gaming setup used to be really cluttered and not functional for videos and content creation, which I agree. I've seen his old setup. What inspired him to build his uh current setup is I've always wanted to see what my setup looked like if I just cut it down to the bare minimum and while trying to maintain a personality. Um, he built a setup for streaming and content. And he finished his current of the setup about 3 weeks ago. He's been building a setup for almost 6 years now. So, that's dope. He afforded a setup by uh content creation uh on Tik Tok which is so cool. Various creators on Tik Tok will be inspire me uh inspired different aspects of my setup and I can't say one in specific person gave me inspiration. My goal within the years to have a full content studio separated from my bedroom for videos and streaming. That's a W. Uh so off of the bat here it's looking like a black, blue, and white setup. On top of that, I love this this monitor layout. I also love how you have your camera on the uh on this boom arm. Um, and I think this is Yeah, this is his old setup right here. On top of that, PC. Here's his PC right here. Um, everything else looks really solid, man. You did an insane job. It just looks so good. I would say it's a it's a 8.7. And this is Valentin. He is 13, a student out of Germany. His main game is Valerant, Overwatch 2, and Fortnite. And his previous setup was just a MacBook first generation. That's crazy. uh when inspired to build his his current setup is mainly set up in setup wars in my videos. He built the setup for gaming, watching YouTube, and a little bit of school work. Uh he built the setup on December 1st of last year, and it's been about a year and a half to build his entire setup. Uh he afforded this setup by saving uh money on birthdays and Christmases, and he built it on his own. He wants to get another monitor and an RTX 3060 and maybe a new desk. Yeah, dude. This is really solid, bro. I love the wall. I think the wall is so sick, dude. This is so nice, dude. For 13 years old, this is this is insane. I love this PC case, too. I think it's like Corsair keyboard, mouse, RK61, I think. Dude, this aesthetic is so clean, bro. Like, your KO management is on point. I will say this is some of the best cable management we've seen on the show in a long time. And this guy is rocking a budget setup and has better KO management than you. So, how do you feel? I would say it's probably a solid 7.5. This is Jason. Uh Jason, he is 14 years old and his occupation is that he works at the lake during the summertime and he fills up gas in the boat. That's kind of cool. He's located in Alabama and his main game is Apex. This is his very first setup and what inspired him to build this setup is it is it is his current hobby and enjoys computer building. He built the setup for school and gaming and he built it about 6 months ago. It took about 3 years to save up and build this setup. He afforded his setup by filling up boats in the summertime. His dad helped him with the table and he wants to see him prosper. So, he helped him with the setup. He wanted to start a YouTube channel to teach people to make money and tips and tricks and stuff about how to make more money. W. So, off the rip, I love that you've got these Pokémon cards up top. I think it's really cool. I love the GOI glide across this as well. I think it looks really, really dope. Um, the PC looks really nice and it is well speced. Props to you. I love the way this looks. I think you could have went with a 360 mil rod here though. On top of that, I love that you have a racing sim on the right side and a bunch of like Lego Star Wars stuff. I love the ultra wide as well. I think you should mount that to the wall that I think it looks solid as well. The way you have everything is really nice. It's just you need to figure out a way to like declutter and move everything around and have a place for it. Yeah, I think I think it, you know, it has all the potential, but you just haven't like unlocked it yet. In my opinion, I would say it's a a 6 out of 10. This next setup, his name is Mason. This is Mason. He is 13 years old and he's a middle school student out of Florida. His main games are Valerant and Overwatch. And his previous setup was Boring and a a console setup. He got inspired by me, Tech Source, and Opium Tech to build his current setup. Uh his setup is built for gaming and school work, and he built it in late August of 2022. Uh it took him about 2 to 3 months to build this setup, and uh he afforded his setup by saving up at Christmas's birthdays and small side hustles in his neighborhood. I mainly built the PC myself, but my dad helped me with the wall shelf and the pegboards as well. My help, my friend helped me build the PC, and he wants to upgrade his PC specs in the future. His his current PC is very budget and sometimes slow, so he'd like to uh also mount his main monitor. So, I love the little shelf off the bat on the right and the PS4. I think it looks really dope. On top of that, I think it looks really nice. You got like this little pegboard here. I love that. And then I also love the key caps and the mouse pad. Um, yeah, the PC is a little budget. That's totally fine. I mean, you're you're you're very young, so it's okay. But yeah, it's awesome that you at least can run some stuff. And then also, I love that you took the time to cable manage. I I lowkey think you should have flipped this around to where the the black part is facing us. For 13 years old, I would probably say this is a 6.3 out of setup. I started watching the setup related channels and setup wars in October 2021, and it really inspired me to create a setup that was personal to me. I knew that I really loved the colors of orange, amber, gold, and yellow, and red. Everything really warm colors. I began with having the idea of having a cozy setup. So, I wanted the autumn theme and autumn season theme, and I really enjoyed it, and it really feels cozy. I had the great idea to use the autumn leaves to give it a really personal touch to differenti vines and stuff. This is beautiful. How do I even rate something like this, man? I mean, this is beautiful, man. You don't need to rate it. I mean, it's so beautiful. I mean, it's a 10 out of 10 for sure. Your aesthetic with this setup is entirely probably one of the best aesthetics I've ever seen. You have your KO mana is on point for the most part. Your aesthetic is on point. Your speaker placement's great. Your monitor placement's great, you know. And then on top of that, like I love your symmetry with the with the sword on the shelf. He's got an orange secret lab chair. Like, come on, bro. Like, come on, bro. Has got it to a tea, man. One of the most beautiful setups I've ever seen. like the light bulb on the left side and then the light bulb on the right side. Like all of it falls together and I just love it. Uh the KO management is looking good under here as well. I mean it's it's pretty damn good out of 10. I mean I personally would rate this a 10 out of 10. I mean Ko Manage is perfect. Aesthetic and theme is perfect. Everything matches and just flows together. I I genuinely think this is probably one of the best setups on the show. Thank you so much for submitting William. This is like this is incredible. All right, fun to ride. Let's go ahead and take a look at it. It was ordinary Intel Core 67 years after joining the gaming community. I decided to build it for myself and earn my money as well. My setup is like these because I love peripherals and the vibes coming from them is awesome. I earned money to build my setup and now it's ready. Uh it's really hard to build it from a Pentium setup to a Ryzen 95950X. Pretty insane. Maybe in 2 years I'll add a 4K TV or something like that on top of my setup and chill out for watching anime and movies. All right, we'll take a look. Let's take a look at the first one here. This one is again, this is fun to ride setup. Right off the rip, we're we're rocking like an interesting color scheme here. Um, purple and and black and neutral tones here. Let's go ahead and look through them. What do we think overall, chat? Overall, 1 out of 10. What are we thinking for Mr. Fun to ride setup? We're seeing a lot of sevens, a lot of eights, a lot of nines. I think I'm going to go with a seven on this. I love the layout of the setup and the aesthetic you're going for. All right. I think it looks pretty good. Onto the next setup. This is Mr. Lentics. Uh he actually didn't have any um any notes in the submission. So, we're just going to go ahead and take a look at it and see what's up. This already looks really nice. I love this GOI glide from the top of the roof. I think this looks awesome. The first thing that I would say about this setup is overall it has a really good aesthetic. I love this blue and and and like you know the WSD. I think this is dope. I think this the shelf in the corner is dope as well. Um, and then on top of that, I also noticed, what was it? This one. I love this GOI glide coming down. I've never seen anyone do this, and I think it just looks so sick. And then also another thing I noticed is the cable management. Where is it? Where's the picture? This cable management can be easily cleaned up if you don't want to keep it on the desk for more space. Thank you for the mouse pad order as well. That sound, by the way, is a is a is a mouse pad order if you guys are wondering. But yeah, he's rocking a Gro Super Light as well. Looks pretty good. He's actually a regular on Twitch. She's a I think he's a 9mon sub on Twitch and um yeah, welcome in. Like it looks pretty good, man. Yeah, I love the I love the the aesthetic, man. I would probably say I'd rate this a uh an an 8 out of 10. But yeah, looked great, dude. Thank you so much for submitting. Uh the next one is Mac. Uh my old setup was just a laptop and old TV stand with the used office chair. It was good for school work, but I could barely run Roblox. I set it up like this so I could be more productive with the monitors on my side, and I also have a PC on my desk so I could always know where I came from. My old setup, I afforded it by selling candy at my school and doing a bunch of yard work for my neighbors for about two years to make 2K. My plans are to get a secondary monitor and then mount them and maybe get a custom keyboard. And I'm very thankful for this setup that I could afford it. By the way, chat, he is 10 years old. Th this setup is a 10-year-old setup, which is unbelievable old to me. At 10, I barely even knew what a gaming setup was. Bro is 10 years old. Like, that's that's crazy. But no, this is crazy, right? This is a beautiful setup for a 10-year-old. I I know half of you guys in chat don't even have this good of a setup. This is beautiful, man. I like the idea of knowing where you came from and having your PC on your desk so you remember like how how hard you've worked for it. That's interesting that you you bought one of my mouse pads. So, thank you for doing that. I really really appreciate you. 10 years old. I I can't even believe my eyes what I'm seeing. Insane setup, man. Thank you for submitting. We're going to move on to 70 setup. Uh, I built my first setup in when I was 12 in 2020, so he's probably 14 now. Uh, it was a console setup with a 19inch monitor. I started creating content in the summer of 2021. Also helped me bring my setup to this level and most of the gear is sent out by companies like the PC, the desk was bought with the help of my parents. I tried to mount a third monitor above my main one. So, right here somewhere. Okay, perfect. So, uh, right off the bat, I love the simplicity you have in your setup. Um, I I really love the aesthetic, this purple and and like it's like a purple and like minimal vibe. I'm not really like getting the exact vibe yet. Um, like I love this like, you know, the wallpapers. It's kind of like this like Japanese purple theme um with hints of white, which I really like. Number one, I I think I love this. I love that this uh this PC's here because if it was on the floor, it'd be kind of weird. W man, for having a candle, by the way. Overall, looking at the pegboard though, I love this. The the placing of this extra keyboard, a headset, you know, that you place usually gets put there on the hanger there. Then you've got like a little bit of storage in there and a a plant and then a hanging plant, which is dope as well. I think you did a great job with that. Also, I love the TV behind you. I'm assuming this is behind you. I love that you got like your shoes displayed and then you've got your TV and some RGB stuff. I think that looks awesome there as well. And we're looking overall at the setup, I would probably say this is an 8.5 out of 10. I I think that it's a beautiful setup. I love this light on the wall. I think it's very unique. And then on top of that, I love the aesthetic you're building here. Thank you for submitting, man. Looks beautiful. I love the PC aesthetic as well. Doing a great job there. So, just for reference, chat, this is his old setup, and this is his new one. Like, the difference is crazy. Okay, that's that's really that's an insanely good change there. So, all right. I know that Wind is not going to be able to match the same vibe as that last one, but let's check out Wind setup. Um, he doesn't have a note or anything, but this is pretty dope. Right off the rip, we've got a we've got a couple different ideas here. Right off the rip, we've got this Lean Lee here on the left side. I think this is a Lean Lee Mini, I want to say. Running a little nice little white white build. Keyboard looks really sick. I I really love this aesthetic. It's pretty interesting. I've never seen a keyboard like this. Cable manager is not awful. Okay, so this off the rip is really, really good. I I just love the the aesthetic that this has got going on. Like I love this blue and white ice theme with, you know, all the peripherals in the one monitor really match. Like he's got a a white light bar. On top of that, he's got white aesthetics throughout the entire setup. His PC is white. His plant boxes are white. His key caps are white, plus his mouse and his mouse pad. All of these match, which is great. And the symmetry of this plant and this plant is good. But I think that the this thing behind the monitor should go. On top of that, I really love this this uh Goku DBZ thing here in the in the right. I think that's Goku at least. Um with this little light bar. I think that looks really cool, too. I would say this is probably a solid 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I think it's a great setup. Thank you for submitting Mr. Wild. And uh beautiful setup, man. So, this is William. He is 12 years old. He's a student out of Sweden and his main game is Valerant Minecraft and Fortnite. Uh his previous setup was just a crappy monitor and an Xbox One. And what inspired him to build his current setup is me, Fallen Foe, and Low. He afforded this setup by saving on birthdays and Christmases to afford everything in this setup. Um his future plans for the setup is upgrading the PC, specifically the GPU and power supply. Right off the bat, he has a shelf above the setup. He has Funko Pots about things he likes. He like he has shoes that he likes, candle he likes. You know, there's things about him that he likes. Also, on the window cell, we have a nice Lego set, so it shows that he plays Legos or builds them and and enjoys them. On top of that, the PC looks really good as well. Also, thank you for supporting the mouse pads. And he's got the uh the keyboard and mouse there, black and little hints of blue. You guys got to understand, 12 years old, that is insane. It's such an insane color scheme. Black and white, very, very minimal. He's done his job and and able to make it exactly how he wants. Cable management is good. Personality is solid. I love the lights across the setup as well. Such a beautiful setup. I would probably say this is a solid 9.5 out of 10. This video is sponsored by gutsyen.com, my own mouse pad company. Some of the setups in this video use our mouse pads. So, if you like what you see, use the link down in the description to get one for yourself. And back to the video. So, this is Kevin's setup. He is 17 years old and his occupation is he works part-time in retail. He's located out in New Jersey and his main games are Valerant, Apec, R six, and OSU, which is dope. He started building his his setup as a pass a passion project, it looks like, and he wanted to have a room that he could be comfortable in and express his personality, which is dope. It took him about 3 to four years to save up and build the setup. He afforded this setup from birthdays, Christmas money, and working retail. The retail job he said, who helped him build the setup? He did it all himself. So, that's pretty cool. He's open to suggestions from chat and Aiden, but I really am not anywhere near completion yet. So, right off the bat, I mean, I just noticed how clean this was. Like, this was the image I saw and I just was like, ""Okay, I want to look deep deeper into this setup. I want to look deeper into this and see what personality he's got."" I mean, I love just the the pegboards to the GOI light bars to the the amount of different animes and and different personality he's got. I also love how like clean his desk is and also cable management as well from the setup on the right and the bed on the left and then the art throughout the room. It's the same on the other side. Like all of this is such a cozy, chill room and I think it's like very solid for his age. Also, I love how minimal his key caps are and his like, you know, his artisan pad with the with the Gro Superite. I think it looks so awesome. And then this is where I got really excited. ITX PC. I love seeing ITX builds in in cases like this. I mean, ITX builds are so compact and they're super hard to build in. So, it's so cool to see one that's like doing what I would want, you know? And also, I like your your pegboard has a lot of personality. Shows your drawing, shows, you know, your your different glasses you wear and your style. Also love the uh the GOI light bars as well. And you cable management with a uh with a raceway, which is so cool. I feel like if this setup itself is beautiful, I would say this is a solid eight. The next setup is Paxton. He is 15 years old out of um Arizona. His occupation is a content creator, which is interesting. His main game is Modern Warfare 2 and Valerant. His previous setup was just a very bad desk and too many cables and no PC. So now he's kind of just doing this. What inspired him to build his current setup is he wanted something that he could work, game, and have nothing cluttered. So he wanted a very organized workspace and I think he achieved that here so far. Uh he built a setup for consecration and for work and he built the setup about 2 months ago. It took him entirety of two days to build the entire setup. His brother helped him build a setup with the technical stuff, the cable management, etc. His future plan is future plans is to buy a camera, a Sony a6000 with a 16 mm lens, which is dope. And then he wants to add another monitor for this setup. Man, this already looks super solid. So, I'm really excited to take a look at what you got for us. Cable management, very, very solid. Very impressive. Love the raceways in front. Love how you've mounted the uh the power ship there as well. Yeah. So, this double stack monitor, I just love how clean and like the clean this is. I also love the PC as well. All white build uh white Asus stricks motherboard. And then also a 30. This looks like a 3060 maybe. It's so awesome. But overall, I'd probably rate this a 7.5. Uh the here is the next setup by Valentine. He's 17 and he's a a student and a small content creator out of Germany. His main games are Valerant and Minecraft and his previous setup was just a really bad PC setup with cheap peripherals. What inspired him to build his current setup right now is Tech Source Gutsyen and Low. So thank you. Um and what he built his setup for is content creation and streaming. He built a setup about 2 months ago and it took him about 2 years to build this exact setup in the way he wanted it. He afforded his setup by streaming and delivering newspaper which is an interesting job. I think he's doing a lot of this for the the Christmas theme with the green, orange, and then red and then, you know, stuff like that. But I think normally it's blue and white. I love where your your camera is. It's like nice and minimal in between both monitors. The plants kind of go in between and then you've like put the plants in really solid spots as well. But yeah, overall I love this setup. If the color scheme was all normal, I would say it's probably a 7.5. The next setup is by Sam. Now, this one has a lot of personality, so get ready. I love this setup off of the bat. He is 17 years old and his occupation is going to school to be an electrician. He's located in Norway and his main games are Modern Warfare 2 and Rocket League. His previous setup was just like a old TV and a PS4 that he wanted to get an actual space from. What inspired him to build his current setup is Setup Wars. Uh he built the setup for gaming, work, and school. And he built the setup in August 2022. It took him about five to six years to save up and actually get the style for this setup. He afforded this setup by working in construction and other jobs over the summer breaks when he didn't have school for the electrician stuff. And his dad helped him order parts and a little bit was setting up some stuff in the gaming stuff. His future plans for the setup is to mount a light strip, get some better double-sided tape for hanging his power strips underneath the desk, and maybe just a different mouse pad. Off of the bat though, I just love this color scheme. I haven't seen this color scheme really used a lot recently. Nice little couch here as well. Got a white little uh GPU as well. So so cool. Like from the theme to to the area to the placing. It's so nice. But yeah, the the craziest thing is he's flexing on y'all. Bro just got an extra GPU on his desk. Straight up. I also like that where his mic placement is. I think it's great. And also I love this color scheme, man. I feel like this color scheme is one of my favorites that I've seen. On top of that, your PC looks really solid. I would say get some cable combs for your cables cuz they look a little scary. But other than that, everything else in your PC looks great. I would say this is a probably a solid seven. I bid I think he's 15 he's 15 years old. His student out of sir Lanca and his main game is Fortnite and War Zone. His previous setup was just a PS4 and what inspired him to build his Korean setup is me and Tech Source which is dope. He uses his setup for gaming, racing, and productivity. He built the setup about three days ago. He said two days. So, it took him about two days to put it all together and get it all put together. That's so that's that's pretty dope. That's pretty dope. He afforded this setup by his savings and saving up over a couple years to get it. And no one else really helped him build this entire setup and he did this by himself. So, that's pretty cool. This is already really super solid. Like, let's take a look into this a little bit and get a little bit of a deeper dive. Laptop setup on the left, racing setup on the right. Very run-of-the-mill, which is really cool. I've never seen a racing setup sim like this. Um, it's really nice. I like to see that there's like all you have to do is like turn your chair and you're just right there. Like I feel like the usability of that is dope and you can literally just turn your chair and you're racing and then when you're ready to do some work, you just turn back. And I think that's that's such a unique way of doing things. Also, cable management is really solid, by the way. You've done a really good job of hiding your cables. I like to see more personality in this setup. uh when it comes to shelves and and maybe more things about you, but for cleanliness, cable management, and like working with what you had, um you did a great job. Seems like the the the chat consensus is 6 out of 10. And yeah, he's a 13-year-old from Kansas. He bought his setup from Birthday Money, and his main game is Valerant. He built this setup to play games and study for school, which took him around a whole year to fully upgrade and add everything. Okay, bro. Okay, bro. What is this? Bro's got the toilet paper roll in the setup, bro. That's crazy. Look at the mouse pad. What in the What in God's name is going on? He can take a without leaving the session. Respect. Okay, dude. Come on. Yo, I like the creativity in this setup, man. Look at his mic holder. Bro's got it taped to a light. Look at that. He's got the mic taped to the light, bro. I do like how you match your wallpapers to the thing on the back, right? Um, the speaker placement's okay, I guess. You know, it it just seems very unusful. Like, you could probably like move a speaker further right if you didn't have this random mic holder here. You know, you could put the speaker where your toilet paper is if you know, you got rid of that, too. Looking at the cable management, dude. I can kind of see it from underneath here. Just get a raceway. It solve all your problems here. Overall, I would just recommend like take everything out and start over. Reorganize, you know, reable manage. Use some raceways. The PC looks good, too, man. You got like a solid build going on. So, but overall it's not bad. Okay, it's not bad. It just needs some work. It just needs some love. You know what I'm saying? I'll probably give it a solid three, dude. I'll give it a solid three. You know, you tried. You got a decent setup, a great foundation, good PC. I think you just need a little bit of love to the setup, man. Wyatt setup. He's a 12-year-old out of Georgia. He's a student, and his main games are Red Dead Redemption 2 and Fortnite. He built the setup for fun, and he started a YouTube channel. It took him around a year and a half to get everything to where it is now. And he has an RK61 with an Atrix mouse. His monitors are Samsung ones. He'll upgrade soon. And he built this PC with his dad. Here's a here are the specs for the PC. Looking off the rip here. I mean, Okay. The KO management needs some work. Now, you'd probably a raceway would probably solve all your problems here. It's a very nice setup though. Besides that, I mean, this could go, you know, like this could go a lot of cables underneath. I would have say I would say cable management. Looking past the cable management, we got a really nice setup on our hands. Regardless of the cable management though, let's take a look. We got personality out the wazu. Spider-Man in the middle, some lighting. Uh the monitor backgrounds I really like actually. I think it matches the setup a lot. Overall, I mean, it's not bad. You got a really solid foundation here, dude. The only thing I'd recommend is maybe mounting the monitors to a um to a stand. I'd recommend getting two individual single ones and maybe doing uh one vertical, one horizontal, or both horizontal, but just make sure that they're more sturdy to the death. Um, but overall, I mean, it looks really nice, man. Like, this is just a beautiful setup. I really like this, man. Honestly, I would probably rate this like a solid seven just because like the cable management's not there. It could have a little more personality, but it does have more personality than most setups that I see. For for 12, it's a really solid setup. This is Nihat. Uh, he's a 13-year-old living in Vietnam. Mainly plays CS GO, GTA 5, and FIFA. uh uses a setup mainly for school work, coding, editing, and gaming. It took him around 3 years to save up and build everything. He afforded all this by selling a CS:GO inventory on lucky money. Okay, if I'm honest, bro, I I really want to see your CSGO inventory. I'm a big CSGO inventory nerd. Chat knows this. Honestly, I've never seen somebody use this. Yo, wait. This is kind of genius. Yo, bro. Bro doesn't want his bed to like like take out the light, you know? So, what he does is he makes like a portable um a portable pegboard, dude. They go they clamp to the side of the desk. That's actually sick. And it like cuts it off from like the rest of the thing. So, he's got like a little mini wall next to him. And then looking at the rest of the the the room here. I like that actually a lot. The printer the printer on top of the speaker is crazy. Um but the cable management is pretty good. Um you did pretty good like hiding the cables here. Looking at the this side of the setup. I like this a lot, man. The only thing I'd recommend is maybe moving the PC a little farther to the right, you know, so you can have more mouse pad room. The shelf is nice with the personality up top. And also the nanles are like perfect. And this is a really nice setup for like, you know, straight run-of-the-mill, man. It's a one monitor setup. Very clean, you know? Like I actually really like this. I would rate this probably a solid eight. Man, this is Max. He's a 12-year-old from California. His main games are Fortnite and Modern Warfare 2. He built this setup uh to to stream, make content, play games, and some school work. Bet. It took him around two years to build this setup. And here are his specs right here. So, looking off the bat, I mean, it's just a nice white Toppo setup here. Got the GA too. Okay. Okay. Also, uh the cable management is a little whack. I would like to see maybe mounting the power ship underneath the bottom of the desk. Looking at the back of the setup, a lot of cool posters in the back. Attack on Titan looks like uh Dragon Ball Z. you know, the keyboard and mouse. Nice little budget option there. Um, but looking at the whole setup, I mean, it's nice. I would say to change your lighting on your PC to white if you can. But yeah, overall, I mean, it's not bad. It could use a little bit more personality, right? But looking at the setup itself, I mean, at least you got some posters on the wall and you got things that you like, you know. Looking good. I would say this is a a solid 7 out of 10. Really clean. Uh, just get some cable better cable management and it will come out really clean. This is Ozamad setup. He's 13, but he turns 14 in October. He's from Australia, and he mainly plays Minecraft and Rock League. He built a setup for school work, playing video games, and content creation. Here's his YouTube. It took him around one year to build his setup. And here are his specs right here. He afforded his setup by chores around the house, and helping his dad with some garage door installs. Is this a loft bed setup again, bro? Bro, we get surprisingly a good amount of these, bro. I love loft bed setups, dude. Really, really chill, you know, two monitor setup here. Just looking at it off the bat. really really good cable management. And then underneath the bed I really like, too. I think that the bed setup's cool. But what is this PC? What is that? It looks super odd shaped. I I don't know. Um the mouse pad could use some work though. That mouse pad is tiny, brother. You have all this room, too. You could you could add a nice little mouse pad in there. Some good lighting you can add is maybe some GOI glides across the bottom. Um also maybe some more lighting underneath the desk, like going down and underneath the shelf. Adding a few of those things would make this setup just have a little bit more of that lighting. Now, personalitywise, it's it's kind of hard because there's not a whole lot of um room in the setup to add things, you know, mount stuff on this wall here, th",
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I love tosee this aesthetic with the plants andthe way that he utilizes color theme Iwould rate this probably a I want to saya 7 out of 10 a 7 out of 10 would beawesome for a 13 years old I mean thisis this is beautiful all right we'removing on to the last setup this is uhMason Mason setup right here let's goahead and take a look at it so he is 13he's located in Florida his main game isvalerant and Apex his previous setup wasjust a console setup and what inspiredhim to build his current setup now isthat he had friends with nice setup so Itook inspiration from YouTube and themand my setup is now better than theirsalways love to see that how long did ittake to build a setup about a month andhe afforded to set up by Christmasbirthdays in selling water to Golfers ona golf course in my neighborhood sourcelove it who helped build his setup hisbest friend and and me built the PC heknows about tech more than I do so I dideverything by myself so like the setuphimself he did by himself but his friendhelped him build the PC that's awesomehe'd also like to add some shelves andsome extra decorations so the walls soaren't so pling yeah I would agree offthe rip I just appreciate you supportingthe mouse pads again I can't thank youguys enough seeing so many of you guysthat have a mouse pad of mine like itjust makes me so happy inside man youknow like it just makes me feel great sothank you guys thank you guys for doingthat so yeah off the rip he's got thisblue and white setup little plane areaon the right um with a few differentmiscellaneous things on top of that he'sgot a nice little mic on the right withthe PC dual monitor setup one stackedone uh horizontal for 13 years old manthis is beautiful I would say this is asolid six for for a 13-year-old thatjust built this setup like man this hasa lot of potential a lot of empty wallspace a lot of um great potential hereand you've done a really great job ofputting what you had this setup righthere isn't bad I mean it's a singlemonitor setup you know just gameing PCand I'm assuming this is more forproductivity and some light gaming it'snot bad I love the the shm 7B and dt90pro maybe he's some sort of streamer orpodcast person or YouTube person evenhonestly it's not bad I think he did areally good job at just putting a setupthere and making it happen I think he'sgot some really good organization I feellike the only thing he could change isif you wanted to put the PC on the flooryou would have more organization skillswith this because then you can maybe goultrawide if you're more productivity oryou know you could just have more roomon your desk per se I think it's reallysolid man I think you did a really goodjob my recommendation here would be justbasically don't put the PC on the deskcuz it's not like something that youneed to really show off per se it's notinsane it's not like an insane PC likewater cooled or anything you need toshow off so I would say just put that onthe floor and you would get a lot moreroom this way and it's not bad I wouldsay it's probably a seven seven or a sixmaybe trying to get into streaming yeahif you want to get into streaming theni' maybe do another monitor and uh maybeMount them or however you want to dothat maybe mount it to the wall or mountit to the desk however yeah super cleanthank you for supporting and uh thankyou for submitting Lucas a setup manwhat is this man what is this Bros gotthe lotion on hand dude but seriouslythis setup isn't bad it has a lot ofpotential it's just right now I feellike it doesn't have what it needs tosucceed right like if you're justplaying valerant or just playing asingle game then I would say like youknow it's not bad for that but forpersonality and things like that I feellike you know some simple posters somedecluttering things like that couldreally help this out and maybe even justa new desk even this desk is like reallylike it's intricate like it's got like aone level up here a level down here alevel down here A whole right side likeit's it's just way too much so if youdon't need this desk I would say throwthis out or make some sort of differentdesk you can get just to make it likelook more clean I would say but if youwant to keep the desk it is now then Iwould just say like cable manage it byrunning the C cables down just likemetal bar or whatever it is and zip tiedthem to it so like at least it'll likelook somewhat not that cluttered andthen from there I would say maybe getsome sort of headphone hanger likeunderneath this side of the desk or youknow some way to hang it uh on thisright or left side and other than thatif you're just playing games that'll fitreally well I think it's not bad yeah itjust needs some more personality to itit's just kind of like very Bland andand plain we're moving on to scaldisscaldis scaldis scaldis scaldis manokay chat you see this you see thismouse paddude okay dude okayscaldis okay man around April fools Ireleased this as a joke and I gave itaway in a stream scalers was one of thewinners there's only seven of them oh myGod bro anyway uh for the actual setupthough I mean the red tee you got goingis really great I think your PC and yourdouble monitor and everything and theway you have it mounted is really niceobviously the mouse pad is justinteresting cuz it doesn't go well withthe setup at all it's just like it'sjust me standing there with my ass bentover the color scheme if it's red I meanthe mouse pad doesn't really fit butother than that like K engine's on pointthe the setups uh nice and I I think youdid a really good job with the space youhad I mean it's very minimal and cleanit's not bad I think it's very genericlove the love the mouse pad and andeverything there's not really clearconcise color scheme or anything I meanyou're running blue and then likerainbow and then like pink up here andthen like you know yellow on your mouseand then red on your mouse pad and likegray like there's just colors everywhereI'm assuming you do something with musiccuz you got like some sort of musicthing here but the color schemes aren'treally unique it's like not really therebut for the most part it's not bad Ithink it just needs some more cablemanagement too like as you can see hereall the cables go down right to thefloor I'm assuming there's somethinglike that uh but yeah honestly Blakeit's not bad it just needs some help Ithink the biggest thing is K managementand then getting a color scheme downwhat I like to do and I like to helppeople with color schemes go withneutral setup colors an example is mineright wood right wood and whiteeverything else on top of my desk can bechanged so if you ever want to changeyour color scheme right you make afoundation color for me it's wood andwhite okay now the wall is white thewood is like you know that wood colorand then my Alex draes are white so Iusually stick to a blue setup but if Iever wanted to I could make any of thesecolors red or blue and you can changeyour color setup whenever you want tryto make a setup that has very neutralcolors that you can change your setupanytime change the keyboard change thekey cab change the mouse change themouse pad whenever you want and the moreyou do that the better so yeah thank youfor submitting that setup Thunder gamesbefore andafter before and after I love this Ithink I think the aesthetic is great umthis is really clean from thistothis this is really nice the after lookssick man but this is really clean Ithink this really has a lot of potentialeven further I mean the before and afterI mean damn dude like from this to thislike sh I think the biggest thing that Iwould even say is just a little bit ofcables here but other than that man Imean I love this little border you builtout with like the 3D panels and thelights in them and stuff I think you didreally really good job with that the waythat you you know Chang it from this tothis like wow dude an impressive changeI love the it gives a whole differentvibe and aesthetic to your room that Ithink really stands out you did aninsane job man thank you so much forsubmitting what is this Bros PCS oncarpet your desk isn't bad okay and Iunderstand you have like a daughtercoming on the way that's fine congratson that by the way but you couldactually make this really easily what Iwould recommend is getting like somesort of like little like the $7 tablesat IKEA they have like a $7 table Idon't know what it's called it's gotlike like it's basically a $7 table youcould literally just get a black versionof it stick it right here put the PC onthat so it's not on the carpet cuz youdon't want your PC on carpet in case ofyou know static electricity and youdon't want anything to get messed up inthere from there I'm assuming majorityof these cables your controller and youryour headset right so if you get likethe little $7 table put that on thereput the headsetthere so then I would just say like youknow when you're done with your Xboxcontroller just W it up and put it onthe desk and then maybe get like somesort of couple dollar headphone hangerand put it like on the side of this deskor whatever and just those three thingswould literally clean up your entiresetup and make it super minimal but nohonestly the the biggest advice I wouldgive is get something for this uh PC tosit on and then um you know put yourcable like put your controller on thedesk and then get a headphone hangerthose three things would really help itout but honestly not bad Brandon setupisn't bad I think that where your waterjugs are if there's room to put your PChere I feel like that's where you shouldput it move this monitor more to theright but maybe your Nintendo switch canstay where the PC is but move the PChere instead because now you have I Idon't know if it's deep enough but maybeget some sort of thing to extend it andjust like put it here because I feellike that would help a lot of your cablemanagement as well the left is justCable Management like city um but Ithink just putting the PC on the rightside instead would kind of clean up thisarea if you need a bigger desk you cando that too but overall it's not bad Ithink all you need is just some betterorganization skills with the setup umfor one the Shelf isn't centered withthe desk um it's kind of like slightlyoff to the right so I would say ifyou're going to get the Shelf maybe geta longer shelf or Center this with thisMonitor and then take this PC and put itto the right and try to organize itsomehow maybe in this back corner putall the cables there the desk is veryinteresting it looks very old so if youdo want to upgrade then that would be aperfect opportunity to start over withyour setup but uh in the meantime Ithink this area right here is solid foryour PC I would move the lamp maybe onthe left side and honestly it doesn'tlook bad just with a couple organizationskills and some more symmetry the setupcould be really solid I would say it'sprobably like a five or six maybe even afour he is main occupation is school andhis main games are Minecraft Roblox CodModern Warfare 2019 and fortnite hebuilt a setup to have fun with hisfriends listen to music and watch videosand it took him around 3 years to buildand save up for this setup he also mademoney for this setup by selling Pokemoncards that's cool also making money fromChristmas and birthdays he built thissetup all by himself and here are thespecs right here from what I can tell itlooks like a two monitor setup here notthe best but I think you can clean upand declutter and maybe add some morepersonality than you already have I dolike the shelves up top for sure CableManagement definitely could be a littlebetter yeah I would say since you havelike this big uh board in the middlejust mount everything to the back ofthis and it would fix itself yeahoverall it's it's not bad I think thatit could use some work though for sureum maybe some decluttering someorganization from what I can see it'snot terrible but I would give it a probaa solid 5.5 I wish I could have seenmore about the setup because again likeyou know quesa was jumpingjack Cas some was doing jumping Jack'snext door this is Braden he's a13-year-old out of Louisiana he makesYouTube videos he edits and he alsostreams he tends he tends to play a lotof valerant but also plays other gameslike Minecraft fortnite con and Robloxand he built the setup to have a cooland nice place to chill make videos andplay games uh he started building hestarted building this setup aroundFebruary 2020 so about 3 years or so umand here are the specs and everythingthat he has built so far he afforded thesetup through allowance birthday moneyand Christmas money and his dad helpedhim build majority of the setup inspiredhim to build this setup was me MD Ktourus and Vermax I know the cablemanagement is terrible but that is notone of my main focuses while building itohno no man nooh it's so clean it's so good beforethat dude oh my gosh overall I really dolike the theme and the color schemeyou're going for um the only thing Iwould really recommend is the cablemanagement from what I'm seeing thepersonality is clean I like how you puta lot of the lighting here um thelighting shines really good too um leasthe's honest yeah I think the biggestthing is you don't even have to be goodat K management bro you can just mount aRaceway underneath put all the cables inthere and then that's it you know likeyou could literally just put a nice raceweight right underneath stash all the cathe cables in there and then you're doneyou don't even have to like organizethem people think you have to be likesuper organized with all your cables youreally don't have to you can just throweverything in there and be done you knowyou don't have to focus that it's reallynice like the color scheme you keptthroughout the whole setup is reallynice I also like the little um thevalerant knife is really cool on thestand the PC with the lighting andeverything looks great as well keyboardand mouse and everything look good isthat is that my mouse pad I think it istoday's sponsor is actually me guts.comthere are some setups in this video thatuse my mouse pads and if you likesomething you see they're actually 20%off of 36 bys right now on gutsyaiden.com now back to the video I wouldprobably give this a solid 7.5 maybeeight out of 10 I really like this Ithink that the vibe is really there Ithink you could add a little bit moreabout him in this setup but it's veryclean for sure all right this is HTIsetup he's a 15-year-old and he's fromSweden plays fortnite and Call of Dutysometimes build a setup from manyconsecrators and he just wanted to havea clean workplace how he fored thissetup was uh trading Drop Shipping andhe also studies in school and he foredhe financed the setup their earningsfrom Drop Shipping and trading um withthe funds provided by both me and myfamily W that's really cool uh his momass assisted him assassinated damn whatam I saying his mom assisted him inbuilding this setup and that's prettymuch everything that is uh there for theinfo so looking at this I mean I reallylike the uh the way this is going man Ithink that this is a Vibe and I thinkover time you'll keep building it up andmaking it better uh the only thing I'drecommend is maybe to get this mainmonitor off the desk and maybe raise ita little higher overall I really likethe room and this wall has mad potentialI would eventually maybe come up withsomething for this wall to be moredesigned also maybe a bigger mouse padtoo maybe it's time to do that but thiswall is so blank that I feel like it's aperfect opportunity to add all kinds ofdifferent personality like you could dolike a three-piece like big art sectionyou could do like a shelf you could dolike slats if you wanted there's just somuch potential with this wall and Ithink you're doing a good job of likelike building the setup itself but I'mreally excited for when you build theactual wall too um kale Manion could bea little better obviously maybe one ortwo raceways could really help this outI would say yeah I would say it'sprobably a solid 6 out of 10 I wouldlove to see more personality throughoutthe whole room if I'm completely honestbut overall it's not bad this is Lucahe's a 13-year-old almost turning 14 inApril uh he's an eighth grade studentand he does house and yard work formoney for this setup he lives in thenorthern us and he built a setup forgaming and hopefully consecration soonhe started building it in the setup ofChristmas uh 2022 and he did chores andstarted his lawnmowing business and meand my dad built it together W lookingat this though I really think you guysdid a great job like just looking at thefirst initial images this has a lot ofpersonality and I think this is reallygood um at what you're building for 13this is pretty good like the cablemanagement really solid this is alsoreally nice as well pre-built could be alittle better you can upgrade over timebut I really like the personality in thesetup I think that the shelves the wayyou put them is actually really solid Ithink it's a solid likeseven um and that's being a little bitgracious I think the personality carriesthe setup the the personality andlighting carry the setup for sure but Idefinitely think you should build thefunctionality a little better and when II mean by this is maybe make one longdesk instead of an l-shape everybody gotthe idea last year to start makingL-shaped desks cuz they were better butif I'm being completely honest chatpeople that build the L-shaped desk theydon't give enough on one side now it'sdifferent if you have one long deskright you have one long desk and thenyou do another long desk but when youhave one that's like short and shortit'd be better just to put one longsetup because if you do the l-shape youonly want to do that if you have longlong on both sides if you don't havelong on both sides then it's just goingto look like this you know this is Ollihe's a 14-year-old out of Oregon Maingames are rocket League Geometry Dashand it took him around 10 months to getit where it's at he paid for the setupall by himself from summer jobs andhelping his parents and he builteverything by himself okay wait waitwait okay I like this picture okay okaybro yeah we let him cook too much we lethim cook too much bro what is Bud doingwhat is bro he's got the grippers outdude all right so looking at this setupI mean the cable management could bebetter obviously right but it seems likeit's a budget setup so it seems like youjust kind of threw everything if if I ifit were me I would say this Wall's alittle plain and I'd love to see you addmore but I'm assuming you're in yoursaving for your PC Arc so I can't likecomplain um but overall I mean this isnot a bad setup for 14 I mean you gotthe Xbox for games the Xbox series s isa really good Xbox I mean it's a goodconsole you can still play keyboard andmouse but you also have a laptop so youcan play maybe some games there orsomething but overall I mean you did apretty good job I mean this is reallynice aesthetically uh and the deskitself is good it's nice and big you canuse a you can probably put a PC on itlater on you did really good with thefoundation but yeah I would say cablemanagement is one of the big issues forme and also like um how plain the wallis but for 14 this is really nice Iwould give it a solid six I think Iagree with chat this is Brad he's 14 andhe's from the UK he doesn't have anymain games at the moment but he plays alot of GTA he build it for gaming andproductivity took him around a month toget it where it's at now but he's hadthe PC for around 3 years and he juststopped using it for a while all righthe afforded this setup by selling oldstuff he didn't need and helping familywith work and he built it all by himselfokay cool a lot of things I'm planningon upgrading like a new pc gut a mousepad another 27 in Monitor and addingsome wall mounts okay yeah so thenlooking at this whole setup I mean liketo see the PC there I I think honestlythe the layout of the setup is good Ilike how you stuck your PS5 kind ofright underneath there that's a goodspot for it everything that you did inthis setup is right it just I think thewall mounts would help a lot Halmanagement could be a little better butyou did your best for the most part PCcould have some upgrades but you stillhave a decent PC it looks like thepersonality is a little lacking for surepersonality is lacking a little bit butI'm assuming you're going to mount someof these monitors and stuff so what i'recommend is you're if you're keepingthis theme like this I would recommendto mount one monitor straight on and I'drecommend to mount another monitorfurther to the right because right nowthe way the way that you have it set upyou kind of like have to look directlyat each screen you know you have to golike this and it's kind of it's kind ofweird and awkward so to combat that youneed to mount each monitor straight onestraight on and one kind of to the sideor one above or something like that oneabove would probably be the best forthis I yeah I'd probably give it a solidsix Foundation is good all he needs ismore personality and maybe somereorganization my setup used to be acouch and TV setup about 3 years agobefore I got my first gaming desk andfirst quote unquote setup I noticed onTech talk and lockdown and I gotinspired for some tech talkers andsetups and setup Wars also helped mewith a lot of Inspirations for my setupI bought my first ever PC by fishingcrabs with my dad and we sold themthat's an interesting profession I'vedone this for a couple years now andevery time we sell we earn about $1 to$150 so I'm planning on getting a thirdmon and I'm actually getting a mini foras well for the setup tomorrow also planon adding some man and Goby Glides inthe near future also probably somevertical mounting my GPU I use my setupto watch your streams watch YouTube makecontent for my Tik Tok as well and playgames with my friends wow for 14 this isalready great so let's take a lookthrough the pictureshere this is wow this is really nice for14 this is crazy overall I really lovethe aesthetic of the setup you've gotgoing on there's a few things I wouldchange though for the most part you'vedone a great job the lighting theAesthetics the K management a lot of itis great I don't think it's a 10 andthere's a few reasons why it's a greatsetup you've done a great job for yourage I love your hard work ethic and ontop of that you've done a really greatjob but the one thing I would say isagain your your obviously your chair isone a red chair and a purple setup Imean not much you can really do aboutthat but over time if you save up youcould swap out the chair I love theshelves and the personality you've gotgoing but I feel like this shelf righthere is isn't centered with the setup Ijust feel like the symmetry of the setupgets really thrown off when there's thisextra spot that just like open withnothing in it and it's like you got thisentire setup it looks insanely good andthen the Shelf just doesn't reach theentire way so either you can get alonger shelf or Center this one and Ithink it would make this setup look alot better if I were to rate this setupI would say this is 9 out of 10 youwanted to create a setup that was cleanit was also just a happy place for me tounwind I also wanted to have a projectwhile I saved up for a PC I I it set uplike this is very clean and I workedwith the layout of my room I affordedthis set up by working in a concessionstand for volleyball tournament myfuture plans to get a desk shelf and anew desk mat look how clean this Xboxsetup is like come on Bros 13 this isinsane for a 13-year-old the aestheticthe way that he built this setup out fora console setup this is insane I lovethe way that this looks I love the woodwith the orange and blue hints accentsto the entire setup you know I think youdid an insane job like just theaesthetic you got going on I really lovefrom the plants and the the light woodand then on top of that your even youryour frames for your pictures match youhave a pegboard that matches the samecolor of the wood like the attention todetail in this setup is insane obviouslyI love the little key cap set as well Ithink he did a great job the mouse padyes could use an upgrade you know whereto go but I I like do I even dare saythis is a 10 out of 10 I mean like thecable management isn't the best you knowlike it's not like insane but like thethe minimalism on this setup is isinsane like tending todetail like the way that you dideverything like I just can't findanything wrong with it I love it theonly thing I could complain about isthis Black Cube but I know that theydon't make them in the same wood theblack accents with this works the CBLwould be the only thing that I would saylike I would complain about but you dida great job hiding them behind yourmonitor too you know what make this evencleaner is if you mounted this monitorwhich I don't if you can do you're also13 but for 13 this is an incrediblesetup man you did a great job do notthink that you did bad at any way but Ilove this setup bro you did a great joboverall you did a great job I think Ilove the aesthetic wood with the blueand the orange I think just complimentthe setup very well like this just looksinsane even wrapping your Xbox adifferent color maybe some orange andblue like maybe this you know like wouldlook nice on the Xbox but for the mostpart you're trying to build a PC so forthis setup I would probably rate this9.9 the only .1 I would take away wouldbe for this Cable Management it's noteven that bad first setup was ugly Lwith one monitor first gen Xbox my setupis currently like this since what a andI were able to come up with G aensponsored the build with majority of thePC setup as well while I've been offwork and home more plans of the futureincluding adding more wall art andupgrading some PC component this is itso this is uh it's actually my cousin'ssetup I think Joey setup is like perfectI know you guys you can see it from thisside but this is like a waste underneaththe K man's really organized it doesn'tlook as organized as it is but it isagain you know we have his his Astro onthe left side with with his headsethanger here and then like his controllerhanger here as well and then the cablegoes across cuz he plays with a cableand overall I think it's it's reallygood like the cable management you guyscan see like we have a Raceway there ahub here for plugging in different stuffand then also you know different thingslike that I think Joey's setup's reallygreat what do you guys think chat youguys would rate this one out of 10 whatdo you guys think I mean for the mostpart for his setup and like hisaesthetic he's building I feel like he'sdone a great job solid eight yeah Ithink it's a solid eight or nine theonly thing that I would recommend isthis wall just feels a little emptywhich he knows that I think he's goingto put like shelves or um some differentwall art and stuff like that in myopinion I would rate this probably an8.5 or yeah an 8.5 out of 10 I couldhave done a little bit better with the Kmanagement below the monitors as wellbut for the most part I love theaesthetic he's got going on and I thinkhe did a great job I started my setupwhen I was around 13 to 14 years old itwas really really plain and pretty badin general I saw all the potential in mysetup looking at videos on YouTube so Idecided it was time to upgrade and startputting in some work on my setup the wayI afforded this St I was going to workwith my dad over the summer on weekendsmy plan for the future is to buy abigger desk like a Salen countertop orsome Alex Shores and get the Topo whitemouse pad which I'm actually rockingFirst Impressions I really like thissetup right off the rip ooh little bitof skill management okay but overalllike this is pretty nice I love theaesthetic of the PC already like yousaid you needed a new desk so I'm notgoing to rip you a new one for that yesyou do need a new desk your desk is onlife support you do need a desk so yeahthat'll be an upgrade you'll probablyget soon but what I will say is youraesthetic isn't bad it's just a symmetryso like the two speakers and then thetwo plants just don't aesthetically fitthere it just feels a little off andcrammed and cluttered like the clock isnice but like putting both of theseplants there feel out of place so whatI'd recommend is maybe removing thesetwo plants and centering the clock withthe Monitor and centering both of thesespeakers left and right that way itdoesn't feel over the top obviously whenyou get your new desk you could probablyCenter this all so I'm not going to dockyou on that but I think maybe spacingthis out just a little bit more andcentering this with the first monitormight help the symmetry of the wall hesaid you're in between color schemes soI'm not going to like hold you to thatbut when you get the uh new mouse pad Iwould love to see a black and whitecontrasty set up on this all the lightsChang from purple to White I think wouldlook insane especially since your PC isall black and white which that was goodfuture proofing so yeah I I think youdid a great job besides the K managementlike you said you're going to get a newdesk so I wouldn't go through and Kmanage everything quite yet maybe get anew pow ship as well when you go to anew cable manage get a very long a waylonger one and stuff like that but whenyou get to get your new setup then youcan cable manage this a lot some thingsI would recommend is watching my cablemanagement video where I go through likeall the products you should buy andthings you you should and shouldn't buycuz I feel like it it has a lot ofadvice in it I think you did a reallygood job of showing personality as welllike you know we can see you play soccerand we see you know different stuff likethat like Disney in some way and then ontop of that you're a winner all guts aenviewers are winners just just lettingyou know in my opinion I would say thisis a solid seven I think it's gotusability It's Great the only thing thatholds the setup back is the set like theactual desk itself and overall I thinkthat that you did a great job for whatthe space you had you just need a newdesk once you get the new desk I feellike it's going to open up your setup alot holy [ __ ] my name is Gage or gtpc ison social media I'm 14 years old and Imade some tech content I get sponsorshipdeals as my source of income I'm locatedin Texas and I don't game much but whenI do it's fortnite or Rainbow Six SiegeI fored this setup from advertisingreviewing Tech products on Tik Tok and Ibuilt all this setup with my dad whohelped me put together my outex draes myshelf and the stuff above the setup holy[ __ ] this is beautiful this is beautifulfor 14 love the shelf on the right withthe keyboards oh my gosh 14 man solooking at the setup right the theme hehas going is very impressive I love howit's kind of like off-white and stuffbut it's got like some nice hype Beastculture in it but I love how he builtlike this this kind of like thing aroundit you know what I'm saying like onesides controllers one sides keyboards II do also think if you can do somethingwith like up top of here like someplants or something like that and Ithink you should also get one morecontroller so you can make these even Ican't even complain keyboard and mousecom looks really nice the PC looksbeautiful he has a better setup than mechat like but yeah overall dude I thinkit's insane you did a really good jobwith this I would rate this a 10 out of10 I'm going to give it a 10 out of 10 II think it's beautiful this is car DTMhe's a 15-year-old out of the UK andhe's a student his main game is fortnitecod Minecraft Swami's aot fan game andthat's his main games,
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,he plays uh theset took him around 9 months to get allthe money for it approximately 1200 lbhe afforded this through birthdaysChristmases jobs like cleaning carsworking for his grandpa as well okaylooking at the setup it's just madcluttered how much school workor arethey making you do is this really howmuch paper they give you is this howmuch they waste in school man we gottechnology now put it on put it on aGoogle doc get rid of all that [ __ ]looking at this though I'm I really dolike the the Shelf in the middle I thinkit's kind of cool that you showed allkinds of different personality throughthat but it definitely needs somedecluttering for sure I would have likedto see some things hung up on the wallsmore like the sword the swords and stufflooks cool as hell why don't you putthat on the on the wall excuse me alsothe cable management here could be alittle bit better and overall I wouldprobably give this a solid six this isDavid he's a 13-year-old and he justmoved to Maryland a few weeks ago Isaved up money for the past 5 years tocome to this and here are the specs aswell and things he uses so looking atthe setup the lights I don't know whatyou're doing with the lights all rightthe rgb's got to go it doesn't make anysense like what is even going on herebut looking at the whole setup I mean ithas a lot of potential I love the uh thepanels on the back of the wall here Ijust think the LEDs you did were kind ofcorny and they they they don't reallyserve any purpose the PC is builtactually really well overall I do thinkyou should get rid of the rgbs and maybedo something a little bit more like thegoie lights maybe I also think thatmaybe moving this monitor slightly downto where the bezel is hidden would bebetter too but overall I mean it's notbad at all I think this is a reallysolid setup I think that the killmanagement does need work it has areally solid foundation but untileverything's fixed in my opinion I wouldprobably give it a solid 5.5 all rightthis is Gio he's a 23-year-old Collegeshent from Florida and his main gamesare Apex Legends OverWatch 2 ModernWarfare 3 war zone 2 and GTA he alsosometimes plays FIFA on his Xbox as wellhe built a setup for gaming andschoolwork and he started building thesetup last September to get it to whereit's at now all the hexagons are madeout of cardboard ooh okay okay his momand his girlfriend got him some thingsfor the setup and other than that that'sthe stuff I bought wait wait wait thisis kind of cooking okay the K manid is alittle a little messed up so looking atthe setup as a whole when I look at thisI'm like wow the color scheme the theway you did the monitors the way youmounted them the speaker placement thelighting on the left I love how you didthis around the little mini peg boardwith the the controllers and I I dothink your cable Management's kind ofbad but in the most part you couldactually just get one big Raceway youput one of them on there and it hideslike 90% of your cables um perfs lookgood the lighting looks good in it aswell and then looking at the shelves Ithink I I love the personality theplants the the way you did custom madeuh these hexagon panels and stuff Iwould probably rate this a solid 8.5this is diux he's a 14-year-old studentout of the Netherlands and he mainlyuses a setup for homework Epic Games andMinecraft with friends,
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,this took around4 years to build it's probably around$2200 except for mounting the monitorarm I did by myself and it took around 7to 10 hours to build everything it's abeautiful setup dude ta management isbeautiful the speaker placement isdecent love how you put the laptop onthe right side so it's hidden what abeautiful setup for 14 you guys can'teven complain this is beautiful man theplant is perfectly placed the only thingI can complain about is the mouse padbro minus one just joking I'm justjoking Ed I'm just joking I'm going togive it a nine the only thing I don'tlike about it is achair and more personality but overalllike this is beautiful and clean minimalit's nice uh this is toast he's a14-year-old and he lives in Canada hismain games are Minecraft Roblox and codhe built a setup by himself and he wasinspired by gutsy Aiden oh damn brothank you man makes you feel all warminside his specs are all this stuff youcan take a look at it if you'd like andlet's take a look at the setup itselfwhat a beautiful PC too oh my goodness alittle little little slight littlelittle productivity setup on the leftside on the right side okay so lookingat it I mean there's not a single Cablein sight this is just one of the thebest setups I've seen here this is sucha clean setup man holy water cooledinsanely nice love the fans love how youdid this so one thing I'd recommend ismaybe if you want a microphone I thinkyou might use the Astro so you don'treally like care about it that much butmaybe some sort of microphone thekeyboard and mouse you could change itup mouse pad is really really smallactually I would recommend just a biggermouse pad uh even the beds made perfectit's really clean I'm going give it asolid N9 out of 10 I think it's good Ido want to see more personality thoughthis is Osman a 14-year-old out ofAustralia the land down under right nowhe's in school he does occasionally goout with my dad to install and ServiceGarage Doors W his main game is rocketleague and he built a setup because hewanted to place to chill and makecontent for YouTube it took him aroundone year to get to where it's at now andhe plans to keep adding to it and he'scurrently building a PC and it isn'tcomplete yet okay his dad uh built theloft bed and assisted with some otherthings as well in the setup okay I'mlooking at I mean looking at this it'sso close to being done man see thatwould that would just make me so mad broif I had a PC like this this damnbeautiful already and I'm like I justcan't use it that'd be the the biggestblue ball ever bro I do love how you putthe monitor mounts like this I love thecable management too I love how you cutholes to fit the cables throughbeautiful idea really nice actually alsolove the little mini shelf on the leftand underneath the loft is really cleanI would recommend some more lightingunderneath this like if you could getsome [ __ ] like the [ __ ] rope lights andstuff like that may put in across andunderneath the bed just to light up thebottom would be really really cool butyeah overall I think this is a beautifulsetup for for what it's worth and onceyour PC's done it'll look even better soI would I would probably give it a asolid 7.5 it's really nice it's cleanit's a really good beautiful setup thisis Matan he's a 15-year-old from Israeland he started building this setup for 3years and he will upgrade it again in afew months he's been playing fortnitevalant and Rocket league and he's beenbuilding the setup from his birthdaymoney and saving up from the holidays hehas to order RGB strips and new monitorlight bar he wants to upgrade his chairto a new one as well PC looks good fromthe first glance honestly looks prettygood I think the one thing I would saythough is like yeah I I would I I justquestioned why you put the the powerstrip on the right side of the AlexShore that was my only my only concernis why did you put this over here whenyou could have like kind of put thisright above this and then all thesecables be like right next to each otheryou could have mounted it like abovethis Signum rack and then made it alittle bit more clean also I feel likeyou do feel a little cluttered this PCseems like it be better on the floor ifI'm being completely honest with youmaybe on the floor or move the desk offa little bit of the wall and put it inbetween overall it's a it's a decentsetup I I'd probably give it a solid 6.5out of 10 I think there's morepersonality to be made and alsodecluttering like basicallyreorganization of the setup would helpout a lot he's 13 years old and hisoccupation is chores breaking andshoveling driveways he's located out inNew York and his main games are rocketleague in fortnite but inspired him tobuild this current setup is my videosand wanting to create content on YouTubeand he built this setup for gamingschool work and content creation hebuilt this setup after Christmas and ittook him about 3 years to save up foreverything you see in the setup what arethe some of the brand names of his setuphe's got goby light his his PC is an HPPavilion and he's running a Kyron V1keyboard glorious Modelo and creativepedable speakers which you guys can seehere K management is tidy we like to seea Raceway not a huge deal though love itit's a very very solid start what do youguys think about this out of 10 I thinkthis is personally like a solid six orno a solid seven out of 10 I would saythis video is sponsored by guts.com myown mous Pad Company some of the setupsin this video use our mouse pads so ifyou like what you see use the link downin the description to get one foryourself now back to the video next oneis Michael setup he is 13 years old andhe has no occupation but he's alsolocated in Florida his main games areModern Warfare 2 and Rocket League PChas an i7 3700k and a 4080 he's alsorunning the fractal design meshify 2 inwhite and he's running his first monitorat 1440p with 174 70 HZ vertical monitorat 240 HZ what help him build the setupis YouTube and learning how to build aPC from there uh the setup overall outof 10 what do you guys think yeah Iwould say it's as a solid seven I meanit's it's really really clean you knowthis is Dominic setup he's 14 years oldand he wants to do unboxing videos togrow his Tik Tok he's located out of LasVegas and his main game is cod hisprevious setup was ram my Xbox One in asmall TV and when inspired in to buildthis current setup is MADD K he builtthe setup like a year ago and it tookhim about one or two years to save upand get everything in this setup futureplans with this setup is to inspirepeople to do more stuff and unboxingvideos I mean this is such a sick setupfor I mean 14 years old this is reallycool yeah I love this man already offthe bat I love the uh the wall panelsalso I love the little the pedals inbetween like the theme on this setup isbeautiful for 14 years old this isprobably one of the best like themedsetups I've ever seen David setup nowhe's 16 years old he's a student out ofworking out of a warehouse in thesummertime and he's located out ofCanada uh on Ontario his main games areModern Warfare 2 forizon 5 and GTA whatinspired him to build his his his setupis a Crea a space where he'd be able torelax make a good time and also do somehomework or edit videos and photos hiskeyboard is a gmmk pro also a KD fanstiger 80 and a razor Viper ultimatewhich is docked on his desk here foraudio he's running a baringer umc22 anda um2 he's also running a dm1 dynamitefor microphone and preamp and then hisdisplays are an Asus Rog 49 which is atthe top his main monitor is a Dells222 which is a 240 HZ monitor the sidemonitor is an Acer 32 in that he onlyuses for pretty much Discord and Spotifyhis PC specs as well ryzen 75800 X and A370 I love the monitors I love thelayout you're kind of working with hereas well in my opinion I think this is asolid seven 7.5 next setup is by Gabrielhe's 14 years old and he is a studentand he works as a butcher he's locatedin Australia and his main games arevalerant rocket league and Call of Dutywar zone what inspired him to build thiscurrent setup is low Tech Source and meand he built the setup for gaminghomework and studying he built the setupin 2020 and it took him about 2.5 yearsto save up and build everything uh thePC is in the case be quiet pure 5 500drunning a 2070 and an i79700 K has a 850W gold power supply and a gigs of RAMand then his keyboard is an eom makerth80 with a G Pro super light in whiteand then his mouse pad is a by the mousepad company Also let's take a look atthe cable management cable management isvery close to being like perfect justthese few cables could be pressed up alittle bit I love this I think this isreally really solid so looks like we gota winner in our chat I'm sure hesubscribed because winners aresubscribers just saying but overall thesetup looks great I mean you done agreat job at your age man Mr Roy Rory uhRory Rory he's 17 years old and he's apart-time worker at a store he's fromNew Zealand and his main game is warzone 2 and fortnite the one inspired himto build his current setup is Cath andslush and he built a setup primarily forgaming but he also uses it for schoolwhich is media class involves editingand making short films he built thesetup in early 201 22 and Gatheringparts for the last 3 years it took himabout a year to build this entire setupand he afforded the setup by saving upfrom half his paycheck for each weekreally clean right off of the bat I likethe blue and white color theme I likethat you put the G feel that matches thesame like the Raging gummy fish like thethe the thing kind of looks like itmatches the the theme as well which iskind of cool I also like your M micplacement too I forgot to say that but Ireally like your mic placement overall6.5 7 I I would personally rate thislike a 6 .5 this is Preston setup now heis 14 years old and he does not have anoccupation he's located out of Michiganand his main game is fortnite previoussetup was a smaller desk and a reallybad laptop and then he upgraded to a PCso it was time to change everything whatinspired him to build his current setupis watching my videos of other setupsand his brother has a setup as well sohis PC specs is an rx4 62 gig bygigabyte Intel i5 6400 2.7 GHz a ram 16GB and his PSU is a thermal take 500watt as well with a motherboard that isan ECS LGA 1151 and then if we look atthe the keyboard and mouse he's runninga red dragon is keyboard and then themouse is a razor death at in white heafforded it set up by doing neighborhoodjobs saving that money from christasChristmas and birthdays let's take alook at everything I mean overall thisis really nice I mean CH if we canremember again he's 14 years old so Ireally do love this under bed setup hereI I think he's done a great job also Kmanant could be a little better you knowthat's kind of thought about but I thinkoverall I'd probably say like a sevenout of 10 all right uh this is Juan heis 14 years old and his occupation isschool he's located out of the UnitedStates and his main game is Apex Legendswhat inspired him to build this currentsetup is friends and gutsy Aiden hebuilt a setup for gaming and editingtook him 3 months to build this entiresetup and save up for it so let's goahead and take a look at his keyboardand mouse here he's running a Corsairk70 Mark I and the Corsair headset and aModelo of the wall um he afforded thisset up by saving up and his his unclehelped him build a PC and he did therest love the bed by the way let's takea look at the room I mean I love the bedlike with the GOI glide on the wall lovethat think it's really unique um also Ilove the the foam plus the panels Ithink it's very interesting I also likehow you cut it out around your shelf andthen put lighting up there maybe asmaller keyboard too cuz you have noroom on your desk at all I thinkpersonally this is probably like maybe Iwant to say like a like a 6.5 chat'skind of on the same the same thought asme this is Carter he's from Georgia he'sin eighth grade at an amazing school andI hope you rate my setup at least a 4out of 10 one downside is I use an Xboxand my main game is Call of Duty I builtmy setup because I love gaming withfriends and it's taken over a year tobuild this and I love it I use an Asusmonitor razor mouse and a Logitechkeyboard I afforded this by doing choresand work around the house and I built mysetup on my own okay I don't think thatXbox setups are bad I think that Xboxsetups have a lot of potential ifthey're done right in this opinion I Ifeel like I feel like it's not bad thesetup is pretty decent the only the onlything that I would recommend is CableManagement which you literally have abar you can hide it on if you just cablemanage a little bit it'd be great andfor this Xbox setup it's like it's notbad you got like a USB hub you got likethe whole Mount I think that's prettycool the controllers I would have likedto see in the actual charging thing butoverall it's actually pretty nice dude Imean this is this is a pretty Sol solidsetup there not a lot of Personalitywhich like is fine I would say probablylike I would give this a solid 6 out of10 not bad for just a year on Shoremoney I agree yeah Cloud setup he's a13-year-old out of Minnesota and hismain game is valerant and fortnite hebuilt the setup because he wanted to doTech videos and also get more seriousinto YouTube it took him around 2 to 3years to build this setup and here aresome of the brand named stuff he uses inhis setup I afforded this setup bychores saving money from birthdays andChristmases who helped him build thesetup me and texor all right bet thefirst thing I would notice is the laptopsetup I mean it's not bad that you havea laptop because that's fine um and Isee you did attempt to Cable manage onthe left side which is good I would havesaid to mount the laptop maybe up behindone of the monitors or on the desk orjust on the right side of this over herethat way it's not in the way right hereI mean like you see all these cablescoming down you can mount them on theback of this and maybe run the laptop onthe back of this in case it's not badoverall I think that moving that aroundwould be your best option I do like themount for the for the mic placement Ialso like the speaker placement I thinkthat's good too the only problem aboutthis monitor is how far right it is Ifeel like you got like you're playingyour game and then you're like you knowoverall it's not bad you know and foryour first like one of your first setupslike this is pretty solid you haveenough space uh your laptop all that youcan build it up a little bit it'll takea little time but you definitely getbuild it up a little more overall reallyreally clean I would probably give it asolid seven I think I think a seven isgreat I mean looking at it from thisangle this is nice and he also haspersonality in the setup I love thelittle shells with the pegboard looksgreat yeah I give it a solid seven thissays hey Lex they were inspired by AidenTech Source and rug I funded my setupthrough commissions and Investmentsthey're in New Jersey as primary game isthat he participates in rocket leagueand Minecraft enironment took him aroundfour years to get everything he's builtnow and here is uh the some of the stuffhe has is in his setup and here are alsohis PC specs as well you know I kind oflike it setup's in the perfect spot inthis room for sure the few things Inotice is one his keyboard is massivefor zero reason I would really recommendnew keyboard and mouse but other thanthat your personality in the setup'sgreat you I think you're an audio headmaybe you have a lot of headphones uhyou have some cars in your setup youknow um you've got like a little coupledifferent things about yourself in therethese are there's a lot of good thingshere for sure there's a lot of goodthings here what do you guys think outof 10 the PC is probably not greatestbut it probably works and that's greattoo I think setup itself though coulduse some reorganization with speakersand where the mic placement is and stufflike that even even the keyboard andmouse I think could be a little changedso I'd probably give this a solid sevenI think this is a great setup I justthink that there's a lot of littlethings that could be changed for surethis is Angus he's a 14-year-old fromAustralia he started saving for thesetup when he was 12 years old and hebought it when he was 14 by mowing lawnssaving birthday money Christmas moneyand I was too young to get a job I useit for games such as fortnite valerantOverWatch 2 and I'm a content creator onTik Tok make Tech videos as well asstreaming and here's his twitch righthere he also started to make YouTubevideos as well here's pretty much his PC4 70 i7 pretty good combo here's hismonitor right here streaming equipmenthere's some things as well here's someperipherals as well this looksincredible for 14 I mean just look atthe PC wow dude keyboard and mouse comboI really like Road mic is clean KManagement's impeccable wow I reallylove the Green in your PC with the whiteperipherals I really love how you builtjust like such a cool backdrop with thelighting in there the wood with thewhite mouse pad it like it just looks soclean man this is awesome I think Ithink my favorite my favorite part aboutthis setup is that the PC just looks sonice with what like how it fits in thissetup is so nice dude I don't like howfar away this monitor is if I'm beingcompletely honest I understand why youdid it you know it's probably for streamand you probably have a camera somewhereor something but I definitely think likethat monitor is a little too far away inmy opinion but I would love to see likelike you mount speakers on each eitherside and bring that monitor in closerbut I think this is like really solidwhere you have it you're at a reallygood state in the setup I think now yournext thing should be adding morepersonality throughout the room if I'mbeing completely honest with you I wouldsay this is probably one of the bestsetups we got submitted and I would giveit a solid I'm going to give it a solidI'm going to give it a 10 this is uhgorlock this is a 14-year-old gamingsetup his income was mainly fromdetailing cars and doing odd jobs heusually plays Siege or hanging out inDiscord with friends while I watchYouTube there's a Specs right here andhe wants get another monitor along witha bigger desk and a bigger mouse pad andan ergonomic chair you have anyquestions about the gear just ask okaysee less I mean it's nice very cleanlittle you know stealth setup tail managis not the greatest but could be alittle better I think I think it's notbad I think I like the um the idea oflike it being very chill and like latenight type of vibe it's just kind oflike chill one thing I would have saidthough is I was going to ask you why youmounted your power strip on this sideinstead of mounting it behind your Alexyou know what I mean cuz I you only haveone cable going over maybe there's notenough room but I was I was going to askthat I like how chill it is I like thetheme he's going for I would I wouldgive it a solid like I'm going to giveit a solid like 6.5 out of 10 all rightthis is Davin he's a 24 year-old knownfrom the best place to have the bestsnow on Earth from the place to have thebest snow on Earth Colorado um he's avirtual data capturing agent my setup isfor work and gaming and it took me overa little bit of a year to put ittogether my main games are OverWatchMadden fortnite Spider-Man Rock rocketleague and Rog company I built my dualsetup initially because my little broand I were University students and Iwanted have I wanted him to havesomewhere to do school workk when I waseither gaming on the left or working onthe right however he recently moved andI decided to keep the Dual set upbecause I actually it's actually reallynice having two separate spaces here arethe specs right here you can pause hefed everything on my own exception of myolder brother gifting me a gamingultrawide on the left shout out to himfor be uh helping me with the setuptogether too wow what the holy [ __ ] thisis probably one of the best setups I'veever seen cable Management's incrediblejust the setup itself dude this is likewhat thehell like and I love that you can likechange different uh different themes andstuff likethat I definitely think that the thepaintings up top are so cool I love theclock I love how you built it in I lovethe lighting I love how you just did allthis like it just looks so clean andthen he also just built a console setuptoo wow yo right recliner chat that [ __ ]looks comfy huh that [ __ ] looks comfybro I feel like I could just sit thereand play some games you know play someSpider-Man you know I feel like I couldjust sit there and and and you know justsit there and play some Spider-Man andchill yeah the Cale management is one ofthe most impressive things like beingable to C manage two setups like thisand make it look clean in each area andhave like an entire setup with you knowthe stuff is is just crazy man you guysdon't think this is a 10 out of 10 Idefinitely think this is a 10 it's gotpersonality it's got both setups it'sgot organization it's got K managementit's got personality like this isbeautiful man so I saw this setup and II thought it was it was incredible and Iwanted to react to it drew man yoursetup is great I love it I think it's sofunny that you put like different girlsin your setup and stuff like that thethe funny thing about this setup that II think is the most funny is that thisguy what age would you guys guess thatthis guy's setup is Kudo was actuallyright so he's 30 he's he's 31 I thoughtit was pretty funny that a 31-year-oldhad this insane like of a setup you knowso it's kind of it's kind of clean thissetup is really nice I I just want tosay one thing though it is a littlecluttered in my opinion he's got a worksetup on his left side and then hisgaming setup on the right gaming andstreaming and honestly the K managementis pretty good for the most part thisthis setup is uh really aestheticallynice I think a lot of the KOManagement's good as well this is reallyreally cool it's a fully collectible PCwhich I've never really seen someonebuild all the parts and collect all theparts from from Asus it's so nice so ontop of that he did a really great job ofhis entire setup the only thing I justpersonally don't like is how clutteredit is I just feel like overall it justkind of clutters your your desk spaceunderneath your monitors but if youdon't care about it then don't worryabout it but I I love everything aboutthe setup from the chair to the wholeentire room overall I mean there's notreally much you can change and if I wereto rate this setup I would probably sayit's a I'm going to go with an eight I'mgoing to go with an 88.5 this is yordan I'm an educator inTexas okay I also do twitch perfect yeahI keep grinding and finding ways toimprove my productivity um I originallywas in a 32 in uh vertical monitor witha 24-in main but I set it up verticalmonitor for let chat monitor for Discordon Spotify let's go look through thepictures here welcome to class I loveit K manag is pretty good for the mostpart pretty solid also I love his streamdeck and his goxlr oh I didn't know youcould change the the icons that's coolbro wait what you can change the iconsof the go XR I really love what you didwith the monitors and your camera beingthe GoPro is really nice I've never seenno anyone really use their GoPro as likea stream camera but it looks really goodI mean I like how hidden it is it's notlike over the top interesting idea thatyou're using your your GoPro and yourtop down camera here I also love thatyou have a peg board with your keyboardsand everything hidden down here that'snice as well you're using my mouse padon the left side but not on your gamingsetup man what is that about come onman um anyway but overall man I love theaesthetic you got going on you've done areally great job like keeping everythingfluid through the entire setup I thinkthe setup is solid like I don't have anycomplaints dude dude dude I caught aglimpse of this in the forums and I hadto show chat this is one of the bestsetups I've seen like on the show so farit's soclean there's not a cable insight man the chair yeah the chair ruinsit that is for sure you should get awhite chair but this is this is one ofthe best setups on this show jennis manI know he's a 17-year-old kid fromGermany and and worked a lot doingdifferent stuff I read his notes andthis is insane like he even wrapped hismonitors to match the colorsright and his PC build is like clean andthen on top of that like his room ingeneral like the aesthetic the lightsthe way that his desk lines upeverything just like that's just it'scrazy oh wait I need to move my camera alittle bit so you guys can see the wholething like look at that like look howclean this is man like this is nuts catif we were to give a one out of 10 forMr mcginness what do you guys think whatdo you guys think in the chat I wouldsay this is almost a solid9.5 the only thing it throws it off forme is the mouse pad and the chair if youreally like that mouse pad I don't wantto like like you know say oh you knowbuy mine but I feel like a white toppoin this setup would complete this likeyou know what I'm saying or a topo icelike you know what I'm saying chef'skiss but it honestly is really reallygood and regardless of those two thingsthat throw it off everything else isgreat in this setup man so z z I think II hope I said your name right this ishis setup the reason I picked this setupto look at is for 13 this setup isincredible man like I was building Legosat 13 still man all right this setup isinsane like I bear leing at an Xbox at13 let alone this entire setup like thisyou know what I'm saying for the mostpart I think you did a great job this isreally really nice I really like whatyou did with the entire setup the Kmanagement for the most part is decentyou don't see it from the top of thesetup and this monitor hides it the onlything is is the monitor mounting couldbe a little better if you see like thismonitor mount way up here and this Mountor Mount over here it just seems reallywonky and I think that might be becauseyou're a little bit younger and you'relearning still how to mount stuff butthat's okay I would lower this monitor alittle bit so it's like on equal playingfield unless you like it like this thenleave it but I feel like you shouldlower this a little bit so it's like alittle bit more even with your othermonitors and overall I mean you didn'tdo a bad job I mean like there's nothingfor me to really complain about besidesthe monitor placement The Vibes of thesetup are great and the lighting isgreat too and I also like you got alittle mini fridge too yeah I just don'tlike this monitor being this High that'sjust my opinion I would also get morepanels to cut out in between to not havethis Gap in the wall because you havelike your panels here right but here toolike you could cut out some panels andput them across or just raise these onones up and put them here it' make thislook a lot better in my opinion and Iwould also scoot the desk a little bitoff the wall so this RGB can glow alittle higher I feel like it's reallyCally close to the wall so it justdoesn't like give that glow effect butoverall dude this is this is nice likethink about this 13 years old and thisguy is like out here building thisincredible setup man that's like that'spretty dope moving on to Noah so he'sage 15 he used to have a massive PC thathad a GTX 97 i7 980x with 12 GB Ram isquite old but still do the job averaging100 FPS on fortnite I set up like thisbecause I main monitor used for gaming165 HZ and the other one is for DiscordGoogle and YouTube Etc I afforded it bygoing around my neighborhood watchingcars and mowing lawns until I got 1K andI bought an entire new pc excluding aGPU plans for the future better GPUstreamer cables inside the PC andfloating triple monitor setup okay thisis really clean I really like the wallbehind the setup I think the wall behindit just makes the setup pop it's veryclean too for a young kid I mean this isnice you know there's not really adviceI would give you because I mean theadvice that I would give you would benot really that useful because againlike your setup is already perfect theway it is like I don't think that youshould change anything unless you wantto upgrade like you said your GPU andand different stuff like that I thinkit's perfect for what you're doingyou're just gaming and also using Googleand and you know homework or whateverand I think this fits this area reallywell well the mouse pad's tiny yeahthat's the only thing I would say is Imean if you really want to upgrade yourmouse pad you know where to go buthonestly it looks great man I think youdid a really good job personality wiseif you really want to like start addingstuff maybe like some cool posters andstuff like that on this brick wall wouldbe kind of clean overall though I meanit doesn't look bad I don't I think thewood looks fine I think it it'sinteresting um some people may disagreewith me but I think the wood looks fineI don't think it clashes too much butfor the most part man it's like it's agreat setupwhat 14-year-old Noah okay there'sobviously there's a few things that needto be changed like this pegboard ishanging on for dear life CableManagement yeah I agree cable managementis cool um the lighting behind themonitor needs to be fixed too this is socool though honestly I like the floatingplant too that's going to be dope whenthat's done such a dope setup thoughyeah also the de you should bring thisAlex Shore in more too or get a biggercountertop you know one thing I wouldrecommend this PC is kind of massivechat right am I tripping on that lokywould think a better case like a smallercase could be better but overall14-year-old setup chat pretty insanepretty insane I would say it's a solid 7out of 10 I think that there's a lot ofimprovement to be made with this setup alot of cable management organization butreally clean and thank you also forsupporting the mouse pads dude Iappreciate that damn I mean it's not badI think the biggest thing is if theseare wall mounted desks if these are wallmounted I would recommend to bring thedesk out more so you have more roomdefinitely definitely more cablemanagement more personality there's notreally a whole lot to go off of thissetup nice setup really clean this isI'm GNA rate this six out of 10 oh dudelook at this beautiful setup so sickyeah overall this is a really nice setupthe only recomend recommendation I wouldgive bigger mouse pad and honestly Iwould move the PC more to the right alittle bit away from this PC like themonitors because it seems like it's kindof like you're kind of snuffed in thereI'd rate this is a solid 6 out of 10damn I work from home setup on the rightand my gaming setup on the left I wantedto separate the two not nearly perfectbut damnyo that's sick as [ __ ] that's that'sawesome I love the the surrounding thatyou did for both of them to put thislike cool RGB in there the one thing Iwould say is replace that RGB with theum the the rope light uh by GOI theythey make like this rope light that'salready diffused and you just put likethe little things to hold it and itlooks so insane yeah I would say alsofigure out a way to make this desk onthe left not bow as much you can seeit's kind of like a u-shape but theright one looks fine I don't know ifit's just like the weight on this one Ireally think this is a dope setup Ithink he did a great job with thelighting yeah maybe get a leg in themiddle of the desk or just get anothercountertop maybe just replace it so coolthough I love how you did the art andthe the shelving in the middle like andthe clock in the center of it I thinkyou did a great job with that too likethat's beautiful and then to have theselike like animes here like is that Aonright there I probably rate this a solidI'm going to go 9 out of 10 dude thispiece this setup has so much potentialman but you don't care to add CableManagement I mean that's fine I thinkit's just a decluttering issue man adecluttering issue it's a be it's like anice colored setup I think you have alot of potential I think the biggestthing is just decluttering and cablemanaging but you don't really care forthat and that's totally fine you havesuch a good opportunity here I wouldalso recommend if you don't use thatnightstand that much maybe putting yourPC on the nightstand would also free upsome more death space too cuz you itseems like you're super limited on thespace you have so chat what do you guysthink about this setup I mean honestlyit's not bad it's just it needs somework you know yeah 6 out of 10 5 out of10 I would say five y,
fake,,fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,that's the old one okay I've seen theold one before this is dope though thislooks awesome though W personality looksreally good a nice little laptop setupchat love the monitor love thewallpapers the personality is there thedesk is there it's not bad man old setupit's a big uh it's a big upgrade fromthe from the last setup for sure verybig setup from the last one uh a lot ofgood changes here it seems very chillaxsetup type of thing like there's notreally uh it's really clean yeah I thinkum the biggest thing would just be maybea laptop holder to maybe put it up alittle higher if you care I'd rate thisprobably a solid 7 out of 10 I like itthink you did a good job think CableManagement could be a little better butoverall really clean really cleanlooking at the setup already I mean Iactually think you did a good job it'snot bad at all nice little chill blueand white setup wallart once he moves soyou know right now it's not the biggestdeal it looked great that I've actuallynever seen anybody buy a square mousepad from me and use it which is so sickthat someone's doing that because I Iknow there are people that you likeorder them but I don't really see a lotof people use them and and this is coolthat I I I can see people using thesesome mouse pads in the setup in thisvideo are my own company guts.com so ifyou like what you see check out in thedescription down below and let's getback to the video PC is great as wellcable manages really well the one thingI'd recommend and I want to see peoplemore switching away from this is usingtwo monitors on one stand chat I can'ttell you how many times I've sat atsomeone setup that has these twomonitors like this and I'm I'm swipinginv valerant and my whole setup isearthquak like I got my monitor shakingand like you know what I'm saying butyeah overall really good setup I'dprobably rated a solid 6 out of 10 Imean looking at the setup already Ithink you did a great job with the thepersonality of the setup I don't knowwhat these are you can tell he's a bigmusic person nice albums on the wallmassive speakers PC looks nice reallysolid setup I think he did a great job Ithink the biggest thing would be maybewall mounting uh this monitor cuz itstand kind of intrudes on your mouse padspace I would say this also is a 6 outof 10 not a whole lot I could really sayabout it if you're using it for lightgaming and you're not really using itthat often but one thing aboutproductivity that I always know isproductivity you need to be productivein it you're uncomfortable or you can'twork fast or you get distracted this isnot the setup for you but yeah looksgood but yeah I would rate this a solid6 out of 10 I like this a lot oh my goshthis is clean this is really nice Iwould have liked to see the monitormounted in some capacity just because itseems like it takes up a lot of yourmouse pad space but if it doesn't not ahuge deal um the one thing I also wouldhave loved to see is the Shelf kind ofmore mounted above the setup versus likekind of like off to the right and thiscould be easily fixed by getting abetter desk I think this desk is uh kindof struggling a little bit but overallit's not bad it's not like it's like theend of the world end all be all type ofthing so from The Vibes I'm getting itis a graduate she has makeup on theright side I'm assuming this is a girlsetup I could be wrong could be a guysI'm going to rate this a solid seven outof 10 I think the biggest thing is Kmanagement mounting the W the uh themonitor to the wall if you can I lookingat this setup here I mean nice littlecustom desk here for the boys love tosee that also I really like the um yeahthe desk is really nice I it might be asit stand desk considering like the legsand what it looks like it looks like itgoes up and down I really like that onemonitor setup you know a switch PC onthe floor yeah you need to do somethingabout that especially with carpet you donot want your PC on carpet like this themain thing I would say just get your PCoff carpet put on a stand put on youknow literally whatever but the carpetmight suffocate the PSU and you knowmight fry your PC so I would definitelyget it off the carpet that's for sureoverall I love the aesthetic too I thinkyou did a great job with both theshelves and then the nanise in themiddle I think this is like a reallyclean setup the only I really change ismaybe your headset cable or whatevercable is uh right here on the bottom Iwould maybe try to hide that underneaththe desk in some way but overall I wouldprobably give this a solid 7 out of 10 Ireally like it I think the personalityis there Hal Management's pretty solidfor the most part and the lighting isgreat lexer I'm a 13-year-old boy whoposts on YouTube about 30k they catchingup to me I use this setup for to editplay games and I started this about fouryears ago with the nint Nintendo switchand old TV and this is where it's attoday damn oh my God oh my oh my dude Ilove this dude I love this setup dude Ilove the shelves I think that you did agreat job with the panels behind thesetup and also I love my mouse paddesign with the blue and white I thinkit just matches so well the only thing Iwould recommend is maybe like aheadphone stand or something like thatit just seems like it's kind of on thedesk but other than that dude perfectCable Management perfect aesthetic anddud there's really not much I can say Imean this is beautiful so I would ratethis I'd probably rate this a solid 9out of 10 I think it lacks a littlepersonality I mean yeah there's likesome boxes you use up here but there'snot really anything about you per se umjust you know Tech you already use so Iwould recommend adding you know any sortof personality when it comes to thissetup like Adam setup he's 14 years oldhe's from Norway and he submitted thisabout I think it like a couple monthsago um this is one of the best setupsbecause just the way he Al obviouslyhe's very young and just like the thecolor Keem some of the best you knowperipherals as well I mean his cablemanagement wasn't insane but I reallylike like that he really tried to makethis setup insane like from his agebeing only 14 and being able to build asetup like this I was very impressed andit also took him four years to buildthis setup so it's very impressive to meI just think he did a really good jobthe cables could be a little betterobviously but yeah it was it was reallynice I really like this setup from Adamso at the end of this video I'm alsogoing to rate or 1 through six what myfavorite ones are so I'll look throughall of them and then I'll rate myfavorite one out of all of them andthat'll be like the setup of the yearyeah I I think he did a great jobbuilding this um you know obviously Kmanager could be a little better butyeah looks great this video is sponsoredby guts.com my own mouse pad companysome of the setups in this video use aremouse pads so if you like what you seeuse the link down in the description toget one for yourself and back to thevideo let's move on to the next setuphere Kyo setup now this next setup isinsane so Kaio setup got us one of ourmost viewed videos ever this setup wasinsane I just love the minimalism thethe Symmetry on this setup from theultra wide and then little 27 in on theside the PC build the lighting like thiswas one of the best setups of uh 2022 Ireally was impressed with just howminimal and clean it was you know it wasit was very clean I just look at likethe attention to detail from thespeakers being white and then thecontroller in the middle to the PC buildto you know the white peripherals likeand then just the monitors and the glowbehind them it just literally you can'tteach this you can't teach this the onething though I wasn't hesitant to givehim a t on was because the chair was adifferent color but it wasn't like likewhite or anything I like to see like awhite and black chair in this justbecause it looks so clean or like apurple and black or something just tosee like just to have that extramatching level but the the lighting inthis setup just Immaculate I I was veryimpressed and I really love thiscolorway like that was one of myfavorites um about this is that he eventook the time to uh make his monitorwhite on the bar and everything uh thatextra little setup there and then on topof that his PC is just beautiful likethe vertical amount of GPU it just itwas beautiful such a beautiful setuplike very very sick that was the secondsetup that was uh kyo's setup um we'regoing to move on here to Matthew's setupMatthew's setup was something differentum I think Matthew is 12 years old andwhen I saw this setup I was like reallyimpressed just from the idea he had fromputting the light bar on the top fromthe cemetry of both a monitor stack alsojust the attention to detail with crazyI was really impressed with like youknow like the cemetry the way themonitors were the only advice I evergave him was to move this mic out of theway and move the monitor closer buteverything else besides cable managementwas really solid like from every angleof the setup you know the cablemanagement isn't a huge deal here butjust the plants and the aesthetic he'sgot going on was just man it wasbeautiful man beautiful setup for 12years old um thank you for the mouseorder whoever ordered thank you yeah Ijust I was very I was very impressedwith his ability to make something looksuper clean like this also his PC coulduse a little bit more a little bit moreroom on his GPU it's honestly super sickK manag is solid too chat what would youguys rate this out of 10 I think ninebecause no gutti a mouse pad that istrue that is true he did not get a guttia mouse which they're 22% off right nowsorry I have something in my throat guysum yeah anyway this is really great manI I think the personality was the onething I was cped about is that the Shelfjust look super plain but for 12 yearsold I mean he's got all the essentialsand you can start building some morepersonality to it he did really good joblike just like the aesthetic of thelight bar being there and the monitorsand all of that I was really impressedall right we're going to move on to thenext one uh the next one is I think he'sin chat this is jesper's setup Nowjesper's setup was very impressive youknow Jesper has been making content onTik Tok and he's been working like hardto try to like afford his setup too Ijust was really impressed with his workethic at such a young age and also hehas a lot of personality from his FunkoPops you can see what kind of shows helikes what kind of things he he likes umalso his pegboard on the left side thecemeter is pretty decent besides theShelf up top which I recommended him tostraighten out and then on top of thatjust like the plants and the cemeterybetween these as well I was veryimpressed with everything that I sawhere and I also loved that he put likethis like white thing with the lightsbehind it just because it made the cablemanagement thing glow really well manthe personality and like the whole roombeing able to see everything on theshelf and the posters above the bed likefrom everything in this set up I justwas very impressed with what I saw andalso his PC build looks really nicewhich I wish I had one of those whitetricks cards yeah this is one of thebest setups I think we got submittedespecially since he's only like 14 or 15the reason it's one of my favorites isjust the wallpapers I really love andalso the color theme it seems like it'slike this pink and blue setup but thenyou have the mix with the white anddifferent aspects of like green with theplants and stuff and then on top of thatyou have like more Star Wars stuff tojust show that you you know like StarWars and different other things andmoving on to the next one a lot a lot ofpeople criticized this setup when Iposted this setup uh I got a lot ofcriticism in my comments um because Isaid I didn't like how his desk was kindof cluttered everyone criticized me forthat I loved where he was headed forsure but the reason I put this for oneof the best setups of the year is thatthis setup made so many people mad andalso this setup was so controversial forsome reason that people just commentedand it was one of the most pivotal timesin my YouTube care other than thatthough I really loved his his willing towork he's only 14 as well a lot of thesesetups are 14-year-olds 12year oldsmaybe you know 16-year- olds all the wayyounger kids just overall inspiring theyouth to build better setups and I Ijust was really impressed with how hedid this and you know was able to affordthis by working on his own the kid'sreally young he did a great job with hissetup I was very impressed I just wishthat there was a little bit less clutterunderneath the monitors and more Gmanagement um yeah thank you so much flufor submitting this year appreciate yougang you're you're you're killing itthis one is Jackson setup now I wasreally impressed with Jackson setupbecause 20 this is a 23-year-old setupand the reason I was super impressedwith it was just because of howconsistent he stayed with the colortheme my man built a white and red PCand made sure all the lights had a tadof red kept it all white all the cableswere the same just how clean this was Iwas really impressed and on top of thathis fans have Infinity mirrors come onnow it was insane from everything elseif you were to cut that out from thebottom of the desk from his Quest havinga red cover on it to having my gasticker on there with the red adrenalineone with my mouse pad on top of thatkeeping the GOI Glides red and white andthen on top of that having all of hislights red and white and keepingeverything consistent like this was themost consistent color scheme I've seenand on top of that he has some othermouse pads that he had stored there andhis backpack was red too like man he waskeeping every single thing consistentfrom the lighting on his keyboard to thekey cap set to the mouse pad to the alleverything in this setup this was justso beautiful like maybe it wasn't thebest personality setup ever like noshelves or anything like that but youknow we saw he likes horror movies um wesaw that you know he plays a coupledifferent consoles he keeps even fromhis stream deck and his background onhis Alexa like I want to see vote voteyour favorite setup the winner of thiswill be the favorite setup of the entireyear so vote right vote right everybody5 4 3 2 1 one of half everybody thesetup of the year is Jasper Jasper youhave the fan favorite setup of theentire year how do you feel this isElijah he's a 14-year-old from NorthCarolina his main games are fortniteCall of Duty in war zone 2 it took himaround 2 to 4 years to build a setup andhe afforded the setup by working aroundthe house with his familyum all right um I I don't know reallywhat to classify this I don't feel likeit's asetup um I mean it is but it isn't rightI feel like you could have done such abetter job at just organizing the theconsoles it being in front of yourscreen like that I don't really like ifI'm honest I would say what I what Iwould recommend is maybe getting uh likeon the side of your dresser right herepulling the dresser closer putting bothof the consoles up there and running thecables down and over you know what I'msaying and then youd have more room andthen maybe you can even Mount this TV tothe wall right there too and it wouldlook a lot cleaner um but I reallyrecommend uh cable managing this alittle better overall chat I mean whatdo you guys think I I don't know if I'mhonest I would probably rate this prettylow I'd probably say it's a 2.5 out of10 I feel like you just popped the TV ona table put both the consoles in andplugged it in like it wasn't therewasn't a lot of effort or thought intothis all right this is David he's a15-year-old from Vietnam but currentlyliving in Australia his main games areFIFA online 4 cross and Crossfire Legendit took him around 8 months to build asetup and he afforded the setup byworking in a restaurant and in a farmand he built it all by himself cableManagement's really good mounted uhpower strip here cables ran across alittle Raceway action honestly it'spretty good it's pretty good for alaptop setup dude you know what I'msaying chat it's pretty good for just alaptop setup like it's very simple it'sit's nice it's clean for a laptop setupI I think the only thing obviously itlacks is the personality on the wall butit seems like he's not there for a longtime so it seems like he just kind ofset this up and just made it to looklike you know a temporary type of nicelooking setup but it gets the job done Ifeel like you can game on thiseffectively I feel like you know it it'snice and straight to the point I'd ratethis a 7.5 out of 10 honestly I Ihonestly think it'd be dope as a 7.5 outof 10 looks good thank you brother uhthis is Lucano Lucano oh I said yourname right uh this is L Lano he's a16-year-old living in the UK but he'sArgentinian his main games are rocketLeague Cod and fortnite and it took himaround 4 years to save up and build tothe setup now uh he fored this byworking for his parents grandparentsbusiness and some birthday money uh hebuilt the set up all by himself and hereare some of the specs and the things hehas I by the way I know the cablemanagement is bad sorry it doesn'treally bother me though as I'm alwaysusing my setup at night Bros got thegrippers out calm down yo Bros got thegrippers out looking at the setup I meanI mean yeah it's not bad I feel likethis monitor takes up so much of yourmouse pad room but I mean it's not thatbad since you have the keyboard on thatside the only thing is is just like Ifeel like the monitors kind of overtakethe desk so a way to kind of fix this ismaybe move the the the mic over to theleft get two um individual monitormounts and then you know maybe back themup as far as you can being in front of awindow it might be kind of hard to tomount anything but yeah I'd also readmaybe maybe one Alex dra on one of thesides cuz I like a regular Ikea table isvery unsturdy with just legs oh yeah youalready have one okay I'm tripping but Iwould recommend putting your PC on theon the L on the alextra side cuz likethis can cause Boe and stuff like thatyeah Kale man can obviously be you knowimproved upon it isn't terrible but itcould you know it could be better forsure I I I would rate this probably asolid I'd rate this probably a solid5.6 overall it's not terrible but it'snot insane so anyway thank you forsubmitting it looks good 16-year-old notbad this is burrow a 16-year-old locatedout of the United States he used to playfortnite and Terraria but now
